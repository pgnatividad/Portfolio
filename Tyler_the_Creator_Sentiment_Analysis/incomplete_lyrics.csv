This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep<br/>
Some food for thought some food for death, go 'head and fuckin' eat<br/>
My father's dead well I don't know, we'll never fuckin' meet<br/>
I cut my wrist and play piano cause I'm so depressed<br/>
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so posessed<br/>
This meetin' just begun, nigga I'm Satan's son<br/>
<br/>
My mother raised me a single parent so it's apparent<br/>
That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckas<br/>
Are much important I'm gettin' angrier while recordin'<br/>
I'm feelin' like the Bulls, I've got a Gang of Wolves<br/>
Odd Future is children that's fucked up on they mental<br/>
Simple but probably not, fuck 'em<br/>
<br/>
I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck<br/>
Drunk white girls the only way I'll get my dick sucked<br/>
Suspended from school coolest nigga without effort<br/>
Easy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard<br/>
Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on<br/>
Cause this album packs enough evil<br/>
That you can't fit inside a jansport, go to school with this<br/>
<br/>
I go from AP to JC inside of fuckin' week<br/>
Wakin' up with random girls like ""Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?""<br/>
I stay with grandma, she always bitchin' about her carpet<br/>
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit<br/>
No to drugs I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honour classes<br/>
By those slow as molasses, take this shit to school<br/>
<br/>
Raquel treat me like my father like a fuckin' stranger<br/>
She still don't know I made Sarah to strangle her<br/>
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler<br/>
All because she said no to homecomin', demons runnin'<br/>
Inside my head tellin' me evil thoughts<br/>
I'm the dream catcher but nothin' but nightmares I caught, go to sleep<br/>
<br/>
I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky<br/>
Fuck me the monster said, some how the monster's dead<br/>
Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil<br/>
With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble<br/>
I'm on my grind feeble, my music is evil<br/>
My fuckin' samples are too illegal, play this shit in church<br/>
<br/>
I graduated without honors or a fuckin' father<br/>
He died, no bitch, don't even fuckin' bother<br/>
I wanted a brother my mother I told her<br/>
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada<br/>
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fuckin' situation<br/>
That's havin' our brains racin' like Dayton, wearin' some fuckin' heelies<br/>
<br/>
I know you fuckin' feel me, I want to fuckin' kill me<br/>
But times I'm so serious you think I'm silly<br/>
I'm doin' Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11<br/>
Seven. What's religion nigga? I am Legend<br/>
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition<br/>
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented<br/>
Than 40 year old rappers talkin' 'bout Gucci<br/>
When they have kids they haven't seen in years, impressin' their peers<br/>
With the same problem, the only way to solve them<br/>
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver<br/>
Life's a salad I'mma toss it eat that shit up, Rick Ross it<br/>
Shit it out, bag it up sell it, I'm so damn rebellious<br/>
Cause my mother let me do what I want<br/>
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear<br/>
The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid<br/>
My father didn't give a fuck, so it's somethin' I inherit<br/>
My mom's all I have so it's never meet the parents<br/>
When Danielle or Malonda decide to fuckin' share<br/>
This confused boy, I wanna hug all ya, I’m bad for you kids to listen to<br/>
Soy is not the choice, I'm bad milk, drink it<br/>
<br/>
My wrist is all red from the cutter<br/>
Drippin' cold blood like the winter, the summer<br/>
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah<br/>
Well that's not her fuckin name, but I think this shit is clever<br/>
My niggas wanna know if I'm fuckin', if I'm kissin'<br/>
But I'm sittin' here downin' beers simply just wishin'<br/>
With tear they try to tell me but I never listen<br/>
Cause I don't give a shit like sittin' down pissin'<br/>
Eighteen, still talkin' to imaginaries<br/>
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy<br/>
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me<br/>
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully momma will attend the<br/>
Ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal<br/>
This my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this<br/>
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email<br/>
So I can tell him how much I fuckin' hate him in detail

I'd tell him to eat a dick quicker than Mexicans sprint over borders<br/>
I give a fuck like a quarter with 20 cent<br/>
At Hamptons with Fred Hampton relaxin' at Happy Camper<br/>
It's the fuckin' financial aid at Hamptons wasn't relaxin', I'm taxin'<br/>
""Fuck 'em all!"" I'm chantin', don't complain I'm just rantin'<br/>
Fuck ranking, I'm the best, I'm the champion's chariot<br/>
I'm a liar like Carrey in ""Liar, Liar""<br/>
I'm dirtier than the sheets in the Marriott, Cable guy like Larry<br/>
Peter Pan in my youth, fucking fairies<br/>
I'm using my tooth bait to get that bitches teeth paste<br/>
Fuck it, Odd Future some nazis, black nazis don't copy<br/>
We perfect, you sloppy, huddled and slightly tacky<br/>
Fuck a label on my jacket, screw you like a ratchet<br/>
Screw you like a black teen on Judge Hatchett<br/>
Endotherms and jaguars, drug dealers and crackers<br/>
Able students and slackers<br/>
I'm backwards like Jermaine Dupri in '93<br/>
Escaping from concentration camps with a fucking girl born in a ramp<br/>
That I ordered from CCS with some diamonds that's VVS<br/>
Like I went to Sierra Leone in a homecoming dress<br/>
With some matching pink panties, lipstick from my granny<br/>
Sup on my hat like that motherfucker Frannie<br/>
White, red-headed bitch reminded me of Annie<br/>
She dyno like my state of mind, so yeah she understand me<br/>
Fuck you bunches here, never disrespect my family<br/>
That’s for my little brother, sister, cousin and my auntie<br/>
Wasted fuckin' youth? All you old niggas antiques<br/>
We go skate, rape sluts and eat donuts from Randy<br/>
Bitches like Tia Landry watching Billy and Mandy<br/>
Motherfuckers wanna be Odd but you can't be<br/>
Sit the fuck down all you old niggas stand me, faggot<br/>
<br/>
I guess I gotta be a fuckin' hand-me-down rapper<br/>
From Los Angee area anytime I'm fuckin' landing<br/>
Fuck 2DopeBoyz and NahRight, shout out to Hype Track<br/>
Them motherfuckers could never get rid of me<br/>
Guess I gotta do a fucking song with Dom Kennedy<br/>
Get these fuckin' hip hop bloggers to start feelin' me<br/>
Because I'm seventeen, compose my own beats<br/>
Lyrically I'm dope enough to ass-fuck the dude who made nicotine<br/>
Maybe I should buy some Hundreds, wear some fuckin' skinny jeans<br/>
And follow in your footsteps like a motherfuckin' millipede<br/>
Centipede, make songs about Gucci and cigaweed<br/>
Jerk with my friends like it's some motherfuckin' little league<br/>
No I ain't no fucking hipster, mister<br/>
No I'm not no fucking Kid Cudi, all my fucking fans love me<br/>
Collaboration hits for fans screaming fuck buddies, yo, yo<br/>
<br/>
I'm drivin' in a stolen truck, and I'm probably fuckin' drunk<br/>
Wasted as fuck, can't walk it out, DJ Unk<br/>
My nose is filled with coke and my license is revoked<br/>
(Shut the fuck up!) Who the fuck told me not to spoke?<br/>
Fuck everybody here, everybody vanish, I'll manage<br/>
Hop off my dick and make a fucking sandwitch<br/>
Everybody listening can suck my dick in Spanish<br/>
Fuck you, faggot (Fuckin' Bastard)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, um, as you can probably tell from listening to this record<br/>
I was, I was probably angry, probably on my period<br/>
But um, I didn’t mean to offend anyone, alright, I'm lying, OF

Hello, the Hype is so Mellow<br/>
Bitch I'm dope and my pipe is so yellow<br/>
The blue polka dots, pink stripes and it's pink on the title<br/>
Nigga fuck your role model bitch, I'm my own idol and<br/>
If you can't face it my nigga, you can ass it<br/>
My accessorize accessories bring out my assets<br/>
Nigga they sound on acid, tablets<br/>
Stussy’s G-Shock with my custom pair of 3D glasses<br/>
I suffer from ADHD<br/>
I should win a fuckin' award for bein' me<br/>
Beat bangin' the tom-toms<br/>
My producer selection is fresh nigga, fuck Vons<br/>
Ace the Underdog, thrown 'em on the back bender<br/>
Cause I change my outfit more than transsexuals change gender<br/>
Eating Belgium waffles with Italian biscotts<br/>
I sold my soul to the devil for thirty percent off<br/>
And to you emo kids who walk around pissed off<br/>
Step one: pull your panties down and start to piss off<br/>
Step two: run to your radio, turn this shit off<br/>
Nigga didn't bother, so my father didn't help<br/>
So when my mom would beat my ass, she would always hit me<br/>
With Gucci belts, Gucci imprint from leather welts<br/>
<br/>
I'm so dapper man, funky fresh dapper dan<br/>
I'm your favorite rapper fan, it's an honor to shake my hand<br/>
On the wall, tall on excursions, I'm a virgin of swap meets<br/>
I'm so pure, so sick it's no cure<br/>
I'm dope, where the fiends at? Aight, where the jeans at?<br/>
They had the cooler t-shirt at Supreme<br/>
<br/>
And they see me they play pictionary<br/>
I got a good way with words like a dictionary<br/>
And in that dictionary my name is Bob Fresh<br/>
They at the same spot they making no progress<br/>
Becoming a good rapper ain't that easy<br/>
Of a process, eargasms they have 'em<br/>
The hotels we stayin' in twelve star<br/>
Tyler say ""Yo Casey just write a twelve bar""<br/>
If I'm with twelve people, I'm with twelve stars<br/>
You haters what up, you Gods<br/>
They against us, oh no<br/>

Got all the black bitches mad cause my main bitch vanilla<br/>
She tryna get her groove back like Stella, grab the umbrella<br/>
When it comes to your perception of my shit, I'm Helen Keller<br/>
When it comes to the perfection of my shit, I know you smell the<br/>
Rectum, I'm like a chromosome I always X 'em<br/>
Like Wolverine steps on attackin' a deadly weapon<br/>
I'm openin' a church to sell coke and Led Zeppelin<br/>
And fuck Mary in her ass.. ha-ha.. yo<br/>
I'm fuckin' Goldilocks up in the forest<br/>
In the three bear house eatin' their muthafuckin' porridge<br/>
I tell her it's my house, give her a tour<br/>
In my basement, and keep that bitch locked up in my storage<br/>
Rape her and record it, then edit it with more shit<br/>
Octopussy special effect erect bitches we bangin'<br/>
And please never disrespect my set with Canons<br/>
Hangin' from our necks like it's a muthafuckin' circus<br/>
<br/>
You little niggas better check my French<br/>
You gettin' money better check my French<br/>
Ahh, what time is it, huh? Check my French<br/>
If you got my shit you better check my French<br/>
I make it move check my French<br/>
I speak English but check my French<br/>
Your ho be on my penis she check my French, bitch<br/>
<br/>
I guess I left my dignity up in the cupboard, cause every girl I'm diggin'<br/>
When I'm diggin' in her pussy, I'm never usin' a rubber<br/>
But fuck it I guess I gotta stretch it out like it was flubber<br/>
And leave it drippin' green and red like double cheese buggers<br/>
Chewin' on cum like bubble gum from Hubba<br/>
This bitch knew dick like Bubba knew shrimp, yeah<br/>
Yo, I'm seventeen, already sniffin' blow<br/>
I tell my friends it's asthma every time I start to itch my throat<br/>
I got a new show for MTV, ""Pimp My Boat""<br/>
Because some bitch said my semen was dirty, that's silly ho<br/>
The most that they can do is find me, I'm hiding<br/>
Somewhere where Chris Stokes can't find me<br/>
Oh no, Mister Stokes, I don't like misters, no<br/>
Don't tell R. Kelly where my little sister go<br/>
<br/>
You little niggas better check my French<br/>
You gettin' money better check my French<br/>
Ahh, what time is it, huh? Check my French<br/>
If you got my shit you better check my French<br/>
I make it move check my French<br/>
I speak English but check my French<br/>
Your ho be on my penis she check my French, bitch<br/>
<br/>
Yo, you little niggas better check my French<br/>
I got all stars and you can check my bench<br/>
Left Brain, Super 3, Creator Ace<br/>
Put expressions in their music and create the face<br/>
Of the picture punchline figured out, ahh I get you<br/>
No you don't nigga so why don't you go figure<br/>
You seem confused anyway, pressured enough?<br/>
You the type of dude that choke when the pressure is up<br/>
The pressure is the pump and the pressure is us<br/>
Bitches havin' eargasms and the pleasure is us<br/>
Niggas wanna be O.F. and write letters to us<br/>
Competition's competition, yo you better than us?<br/>
Digest what I'm sayin'? I don't think so<br/>
We sick shit, throw it up down in the sink, yo<br/>
The Odd niggas are beginnin' to spill these pink hoes<br/>
We think sorta odd so we think so<br/>
<br/>
Crusin' in my go kart at Walmart sellin' cupcakes<br/>
Go 'head admit it faggot, this shit is tighter then butt rape<br/>
That involve Ballpark franks and silver duct tape<br/>
Pornos and hormones and boxes of DiGiorno<br/>
You homos is loco you're probably drinkin' Cuervo<br/>
With some vatos with the door closed watchin' Zorro, you homos.. O.F

If this was a game<br/>
I already know that I would come out winner<br/>
And I'm not braggin', I'mma be in her<br/>
But this bitch really think that I'm 'bout to buy her dinner<br/>
My steak good, I got a good cut like splinter<br/>
Juicy and hot such a black bitch temper<br/>
Now she wanna talk and chop it up like a blender<br/>
But I don't give a fuck and keep her list'in like Schindler<br/>
She's cute but her forehead's big<br/>
Got stretch marks like she got four kids<br/>
Her legs can't close like the four door hinge Bronco<br/>
That O.J. killed the white hos with<br/>
A wealthy white girl without the facelift<br/>
Lure her with expensive dinners and a nice bracelet<br/>
Leave the bitch breathless, what the bitch don't know is that<br/>
I'm a muthafuckin' sellout and a rapist<br/>
<br/>
Baby, you're an angel<br/>
How 'bout we turn this into a fable of some sort?<br/>
You already know you're dead<br/>
Ironic cause your lipstick is red, of course<br/>
I stuff you in the trunk, drunk<br/>
Cause all I really wanna do is fuck and snort blow<br/>
<br/>
If this was a game<br/>
I would be considered a muthafuckin' legend<br/>
And I ain't tryna gas you up like Chevron<br/>
But I'm high as fuck bitch, you really need to get on my leverage<br/>
Now we're in the cabin, in the middle of uhh<br/>
Tryna find ways to really stuff you in my cabinet<br/>
Dreamy little bastard, I done ran outta luck so now<br/>
It's time for a bloody foot you little rabbit<br/>
You're very attractive, and notice that<br/>
My hat is always the color of cactus<br/>
And I hang with wolves cause I'm an evil Bastard<br/>
Pictures of you on my wall no glue, no tape but just cum plastered<br/>
Met you at my school, departed at my house<br/>
Ended at your panties, started at your blouse<br/>
Pushed you down stairs, I took a nap up on the couch<br/>
If you wanted a date, don't come<br/>
Now you gotta make it easy for me don't run<br/>
You call this shit kids, well I call these kids cum<br/>
And you call this shit rape but I think that rape's fun<br/>
Wait now it's about eight somethin<br/>
It's late and you stuck in my base-one<br/>
Come downstairs with nothin' but a shoe string<br/>
Yeah bitch this date's done<br/>
<br/>
Baby, you're an angel<br/>
How 'bout we turn this into a fable of some sort?<br/>
You already know you're dead<br/>
Ironic cause your lipstick is red, of course<br/>
I stuff you in the trunk, drunk<br/>
Cause all I really wanna do is fuck and snort blow<br/>
<br/>
I like my girls how I like my drugs, white<br/>
Lord, you're so pretty, lyin' in my arms<br/>
I just got one request, stop breathin'

I was taught to act my shoe-size, never my age<br/>
I always judge a book by the cover, never the page<br/>
I never judge a murder by weapons, only the rage<br/>
That he felt when he dealt with physological phase<br/>
They say that I never cease to amaze<br/>
While half my mental belongs in a cage<br/>
The ape is a beast, tranquilize that bitch<br/>
If you niggas selling dope then you selling my shit<br/>
Selling my assets, I'm so damn illegal that I need to be arrest<br/>
But then they'll get my mom for 18 years of posession<br/>
She showed me affection like a drug dealer using her pocket for my protection<br/>
<br/>
The pigs fly away in the morning<br/>
But I ain't get to see you today<br/>
And if I wanna go outside<br/>
I gotta make sure that I can play here<br/>
I bet you've never seen a pig fly<br/>
I bet you've never seen a pig fly<br/>
I bet you've never seen a pig fly<br/>
Well you ain't been looking through my eyes<br/>
<br/>
I bet you've never seen a pig fly, no<br/>
Right next to the fat lady hitting high notes<br/>
Went to sleep at seven then we woke up from the dream<br/>
Wore my wings and my jeans but my hat is from Supreme<br/>
So I guess that's where I hide my things<br/>
Caged, and the wonder is seen<br/>
Middle finger missing so I can not give a fuck<br/>
I can hear the bells ringing off the nice dream truck<br/>
So I'm chasing the dreams, no realities<br/>
Hoping that maturity won't be too mad at me<br/>
But If so, I'll take the scorn and indeed happily<br/>
Long as I can feel my heart tap like happy feet<br/>
<br/>
Fatherless kids orphans like me and Domo is<br/>
A fuck that we will never give is like our pops<br/>
But what we did was found our niche and made a stitch<br/>
Just like a shirt, that's why our stains smell like the shit<br/>
<br/>
The pigs fly away in the morning<br/>
But I ain't get to see you today<br/>
And if I wanna go outside<br/>
I gotta make sure that I can play here<br/>
I bet you've never seen a pig fly<br/>
I bet you've never seen a pig fly<br/>
I bet you've never seen a pig fly<br/>
Well you ain't been looking through my eyes<br/>
<br/>
And my circus is all night (Don't go home tonight<br/>
Don't go home tonight, chill, don't go home tonight)<br/>
And my circus is all night (Don't go home tonight, chill<br/>
Please stay, don't go home tonight, don't go home tonight)<br/>
<br/>
I'm an odd fellow, the opposite of mellow<br/>
The therapist said hell, oh would my mama wonder<br/>
I was dealing with iller shit like professional plumbers<br/>
Like Food for Thought was my father but I ain't had the hunger<br/>
My self esteem is like me, tall and full of flaws<br/>
My pride is gone, I'm that guy like Aaron Hall<br/>
I know some niggas wear their hearts on they sleeves<br/>
But I wear mine on my head, Supreme

Uhh, addicts arise, when I arrive<br/>
In this cracked crack fag bag slab in disguise<br/>
Fat sack of knives in the passenger side, bitch<br/>
Reach for the door, get your access denied<br/>
<br/>
I'm not an asshole I just don't give a fuck a lot<br/>
The only time I do is when a bitch is screamin' ""Tyler, stop!""<br/>
The big bad wolf to me you're just a minor fox<br/>
Red ridin' is gettin' some of this wolfly odder cock<br/>
<br/>
We the niggas you scared of, like bad dentists<br/>
Flow is anthemic, dirty like it's plants in it<br/>
Sick, spit a pandemic, crack and Cancer mixed with cannabis<br/>
To have a bitch, ready to stab a clit with some glass and shit<br/>
<br/>
Your whole gang will be diminished, Bunch got the Brady's in it<br/>
Spit sick shit like my saliva got the rabies in it<br/>
Fuck rap, I'll be a landlord so I can rape a tenants daughter<br/>
Leave my house with a new stomach, and a baby in it<br/>
<br/>
Face it, me and Ace's is sick like malaria carriers<br/>
Jim Carrey her to the cemetary to bury her<br/>
Listen busters, scarier when I finger fuck her<br/>
After I dig her up and then eat her out with a bit of mustard<br/>
<br/>
Took karate, mommy told me ""Tyler toughen up""<br/>
Rihanna haircut, somebody tell Chris Brown to fuck me up<br/>
Had to teach the bitch manners, now I gotta learn her<br/>
I'll beat the fuck out your bitch anonymous, Ike Turner<br/>
<br/>
Over, sloppy seconds is my preference<br/>
Except for when I'm feedin' on the flesh of a pedestrian<br/>
Nessy loch monster stop! Will he though? Probably not<br/>
Silly hos lick my balls like FIFA lollipops<br/>
<br/>
Get the certain tingle, eatin' Haagen Dazs<br/>
With some soccer moms while they like to fuckin' sit and mingle<br/>
Watch an Animal Planet document on the Eagles<br/>
In the flyest '06 Supreme beanie, Sigel<br/>
<br/>
Your grind's feeble, I'm regal, really, I'm Willy Smith<br/>
I am Legend a Snicker dick in a vanilly chick<br/>
Come take a stab at it faggot, I preordered your casket<br/>
This is known as a classic, yeah that chapped lips crack shit<br/>
<br/>
Hat is always forest so the bitches call me Gump<br/>
But compliment her tits and then its off to hump her<br/>
Fuck her in a hummer while I rape her and I put her in a slumber<br/>
It's not a figure of speech when I tell you that I dumped her<br/>
<br/>
No narcissists, sippin' on arsenic<br/>
Carved carcasses in the garage, don't park in it<br/>
Hard as finding retarded kids at Harvard<br/>
It's Wolf Gang barkin' keep you up like car alarms and shit<br/>
<br/>
Over the edge, yeah I had in a potato sack<br/>
Cause I'm cold as ice like Anasia when she fuckin' Traq<br/>
I'm the type to put you down and bring myself up<br/>
So when I rape a bitch I hold her down and get my best nut<br/>
<br/>
The reincarnation of '98 Eminem<br/>
60 Crip and Grizzly and some RMK Denim<br/>
Pay attention I'm stabbin' your women friends, like a gentlemen<br/>
Then dippin' with the fuckin' pen to go sin again<br/>
<br/>
White girl, you can ask her what the dick be like<br/>
At monster madness doin' drive by's on a fuckin' fixie bike<br/>
Fuck it moron, snortin' oxycontin, wearin' cotton<br/>
Oxymoron like buff faggots playin' sissy dykes<br/>
<br/>
This the shit that get cripple bitches to hop<br/>
Dirty crack pipes with, bullshit to stop, ho<br/>
Boss broke, spouse choke, blouse open<br/>
Sly's little shop of horrors, now showin'<br/>
<br/>
I hate gays, gangbangers and fuckin' jerkers<br/>
Unless it's gay gangbangers: that's fuckin' jerkers<br/>
Whoa yo, yo.. no homo, I'm not gay, faggot<br/>
Odd Future Wolf Gang, Wu-Tang bangin' in your system<br/>
Probably banging in your sister with my children swimmin' in her system<br/>
Let me say this shit in slow-mo, homo<br/>
You don't fuckin' skate, take off that Box Logo

I don't wanna play you, I just wanna tape you undress<br/>
And then I'll lay you down and record soft porn<br/>
If it's romance then it's hardcore, if it's horror<br/>
Pop the pop corn, the thought to rape you really turns me on<br/>
<br/>
Press my buttons baby, Press my fuckin' buttons baby,<br/>
<br/>
You're my favorite show, any chance I get I try to watch<br/>
Die hard fan, can't stop with the tapings<br/>
Sorta like a psycho when I can't stop with the raping<br/>
Of the VHS especially during sex baby<br/>
<br/>
Press my buttons baby, Press my fuckin' buttons baby,<br/>
<br/>
Ready to watch? I'mma slip it in the tape deck<br/>
But put it in slowmo, I don't wanna bust the tape yet, press play<br/>
Now this is what I call an evening<br/>
A live show, almost equivalent to the screening<br/>
You're dream movie, I'm the clearest copy<br/>
Now time for Blow, I'm Johnny deep with the rarest poppy<br/>
Snort a little, now you're getting groovy<br/>
Cause I'll kill if I find out you're watching some other movies, bitch<br/>
<br/>
Press my buttons baby, Press my fuckin' buttons baby,<br/>
STOP!<br/>
<br/>
Danielle, Danielle, yeah you heard about Raquel<br/>
Well that didn't go well, let me try to make it swell<br/>
Put the beaver in the mail, we can take it slow like snail<br/>
Lock my heart up, this is jail, throw away the key<br/>
<br/>
Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you?<br/>
I wanna feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um<br/>
<br/>
We can kick it on the couch, blunt to you, roll it up<br/>
But I'm on some shrooms if you really wanna feel the room<br/>
I just wanna kick it, kick it for the rest<br/>
I skated all day, I just need some rest<br/>
<br/>
Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you?<br/>
I wanna feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um<br/>
<br/>
We can count the stars on the hood in your father's car<br/>
He's a buster anyway, I can take it him day<br/>
Look into your eyes I realize that I like you so much<br/>
That was corny, now I'm horny, can I have a just kiss?<br/>
<br/>
Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you?<br/>
I wanna feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um<br/>
<br/>
We both teenagers with the same mind state<br/>
How 'bout some ice cream and some South Park for this first date?<br/>
Your cat is waitin' for that raw fish I can't wait, get it?<br/>
<br/>
Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you?<br/>
I wanna feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um

I'm Tyler, Mr. Green Hat, pro-abortion anti-clean rap<br/>
Fuck your blog opinion and your feedback<br/>
My self-respect I leave that, in the lost and found<br/>
Where the black girls get their weaves back<br/>
Awesome I achieve that minnie, blastin' ""You're a jerk""<br/>
In some fuckin' yellow skinnies lookin' like a fuckin' faggot<br/>
Bouncin' round the house tryna find an easy way to rape Minnie<br/>
Bet you thirty dollars you find her like Cartman found Kenny dead<br/>
I like my girls smart, skinny<br/>
Kinda poptart, when I bite into 'em red<br/>
I'm a self-racist, you should tape this, ask Sarah, I'm the rapist<br/>
I'm a fascist, fuck fashion, Gucci belts is for them faggots<br/>
My hat is by GB, if you got a fuckin' problem<br/>
With the future, you can get a death wish just like a tiba<br/>
Fuck the biz apparent, Odd Future errant<br/>
I'm watchin' the Berrics gettin' head from someone's parent<br/>
Blind fuckin' hate inside my heart, guaranteed<br/>
That I'm sharin' in the force with the cyclops starin'<br/>
I'm flyin' on the beaver, you're a disbeliever<br/>
So don't ask for no muthafuckin' ride when you see us<br/>
Swim right past you, the shitlist said that I'm nutty such cashew<br/>
Cause I jack off with dish soap and smell gas fumes<br/>
Permanent brain damage similar to tattoos<br/>
The shit you can mention me if anybody ask you<br/>
Care to juggle with the cash news?<br/>
You didn't see me here if someone ask you<br/>
<br/>
I wanna feel her in every way<br/>
Mary Jane keeps me high like every day<br/>
Bong, vaporizer in the sack now<br/>
Stuck in my high, afraid of heights, I'm trapped<br/>
Buy a swisher for a dollar or two blunt wraps<br/>
Roll it up and ensure that everything's fat<br/>
She ain't got time to try to relieve ya<br/>
But she'll get all in your head, Sativa<br/>
<br/>
We grind, these niggas asking for some promo<br/>
We sit back, observe, stacking hella box logos<br/>
Square circle jerks starting O.F. moshpit<br/>
Preaching to the poets, I'm an O.F. prophet<br/>
No less profit, themed when we drop shit<br/>
Convertible coupe, bitches scream when they tops split<br/>
It's that crack, give you something to sell<br/>
Put these bitches on lock down, something like jail<br/>
Thought she hot I swear, probably rougher than hell<br/>
Ain't she ain't gay, but the only thing she like is fucking Chanel<br/>
Light skinned women, all sex everything<br/>
Think we can fit ten in, bowls packed with everything<br/>
Everything that we call flight, living life<br/>
This is everything that we call hype<br/>
I'm everything that they call nice<br/>
She in colors and shit, she off that northern lights, right<br/>
Intimidated by niggas you can't be<br/>
I'm a G, and this is something you can't see<br/>
Top ranked, number one my son<br/>
And she looking for them trees, baby we got some<br/>
And stay focused on the women and you get less done<br/>
It's ironic cause I always hear you talking about one<br/>
Them other niggas smoke, they ain't this high<br/>
How high? Nigga, higher than the kites they fly

I like my girls skinny with brains<br/>
I like my hoodies fucked with Lame<br/>
I like my friends imaginary with no names<br/>
And I make music for the fuck of it, no fame<br/>
Aim, shoot, the gun of love, round<br/>
Tried to find ammo but it's none around town<br/>
So I went Down South but I ended up North<br/>
Uptown sitting on Cloud 9's white porch<br/>
And of course, my car's off course<br/>
You're so white, my blinkers don't work<br/>
I'm trying to let the force be with you, I get you<br/>
Music is my first, but I contemplate divorce<br/>
You make a nigga sing songs nice<br/>
You make a nigga's night turn day<br/>
And you make the flowers sing say turn green yellow<br/>
It sucks that I didn't get the chance to say hello<br/>
I want to eat you out like jello<br/>
And mess with your body like the bass and the cello<br/>
And tell your mom I said hello, you want to go to prom? (Nigga hell no)<br/>
Fuck (Shit) and another one, there goes another one<br/>
<br/>
Another love song about shit<br/>
And I'll be rich if I get another diss<br/>
And maybe Cupid won't miss<br/>
<br/>
Maybe? (No)<br/>
Maybe? (I'm sorry)<br/>
Maybe? (I got a date)<br/>
Maybe? (Where's your dad?)<br/>
<br/>
I like her L-I-K-E, the only difference is she won't fuck with me<br/>
But she will fuck with that vegetable with the hairs full of X's and O's<br/>
I want to tie her body up and throw her in my basement<br/>
Keep her there, so nobody can wonder where her face went<br/>
<br/>
- Tyler, what you doing?<br/>
- Shut the fuck up!<br/>
- Uh-umm..<br/>
- You gon' fuckin' love me bitch<br/>
- Uhh..<br/>
- Or I'mma fuckin' put this gun in your fuckin' head<br/>
<br/>
But all I really want is a kiss on the cheek<br/>
In private, not public in the streets<br/>
And your cupcake how we eat and your toes<br/>
Cause I got a big fetish with the feet<br/>
I just want somebody I can see<br/>
You can be a gold digger, you ain't got to love me<br/>
I'm serious (I love you) I don't ask for much<br/>
Your heart literally is what I do want for lunch<br/>
Now this shit is turning to a habit<br/>
I'm the burger king, I gotta have it my way<br/>
And truthfully girl you really make my day<br/>
I would probably kill myself if you told me you was gay<br/>
And I can't even look the other way<br/>
Your aura is a magnet, my eyes a metal bag, it's attractive<br/>
L-O-L laughing, you're a gold Oscar and I'm just actin'<br/>
And I want your cinema hole, and have our kids play supporting role<br/>
Climbing up the pole, Jack and the Beanstalk, bitch it's gold<br/>
And I was in loath, I would never get over you, ever, Sarah<br/>
<br/>
Another love song about shit<br/>
And I'll be rich if I get another diss<br/>
And maybe Cupid won't miss<br/>
<br/>
Half your body laying on my chest<br/>
The rest is in my stomach, that's including your breast<br/>
And I'ma just take another guess<br/>
Now you probably wishing that you would have said yes<br/>
Am I crazy? Maybe, but fucked up is how I been lately<br/>
Shit, I don't give a fuck, your family looking for you, wish 'em good luck<br/>
Bitch, you tried to play me like a dummy<br/>
Now you stuck up in my mothafuckin' basement all bloody<br/>
And I'm fucking your dead body, your coochie all cummy<br/>
Looking in your dead eyes, what the fuck you want from me?<br/>
What did you want from me? What did you want from me?

They don't paint pictures, they just trace me<br/>
<br/>
Odd Future, I'm your muthafuckin' sergeant<br/>
Nigga, I'm in charge, I fuck with Freshjive<br/>
Cause I get it, no charge, and BBC for the low price<br/>
No bargin', nigga that's a bargain<br/>
Cow print t-shirt like muthafuckin' dog<br/>
On the muthafuckin' farm with cockadoodle doodles<br/>
I'm making straight bitches pussy wet just like a noodle<br/>
And my dick must be dog food to these bitches' poodles<br/>
Felines on the freetime, I'm tossin' bitches' salads<br/>
And I'm eating up they croutons, Erica to Milan<br/>
We was flyin' to Milan, was supposed to go to Bangkok<br/>
Until she figured out that she don't really like to bang cock<br/>
To Soho, baby, Milo so dope<br/>
The cocaine flow, niggas spit heat, propane<br/>
Niggas get the picture, I see, why?<br/>
(They don't paint pictures, they just trace me)<br/>
<br/>
My nigga, no hook<br/>
No hook, fuck a hook<br/>
<br/>
Yo, beside me, nobody likes me<br/>
Mainly because I am not a fuckin' HypeBeast<br/>
I think Supreme suck, we gnarly all our Nikes<br/>
I can wear some Wranglers, with a fuckin' White T<br/>
Doo-rags to match, and I do sag<br/>
In fact, my hat is in tact with the Fubu poor over<br/>
Nigga, you pull over, fuck a Rover Range<br/>
And I'm driving a unicorn, plus my bitch is strange<br/>
And I'm the only fuckin' rapper without a chain<br/>
With a four finger ring like I can't spell my fuckin' name<br/>
And I go to Obama rallies screamin' out ""McCain!""<br/>
Them ignorant thrashin' muthafuckers is my gang<br/>
And the dirty Ladera I can't forget where I came from<br/>
Nigga, you don't claim none, fan I am the teacher<br/>
White and black bitch like she's a muthafuckin' zebra<br/>
Candies in my pocket, I see you niggas on Easter<br/>
<br/>
My nigga, no hook<br/>
No hook, fuck a hook<br/>

(It's gold) The gold is in the back<br/>
(It's gold) The pixels in the front<br/>
(It's gold) The beat's a fuckin' bully<br/>
(Go home) The lyric's just a punk, man<br/>
(Gold) The pink is in the sky<br/>
(That shit's gold) The gold is in my mind<br/>
(It's gold) The mind is in my gold<br/>
The beat is turnin' old, so go<br/>

Synthesizer, I'm the muthafuckin' master<br/>
Nigga, I'm a bastard, I fuck with chord keys<br/>
Cause the sound lasts longer, bass drummer song<br/>
And a hi-hat made of plastic, nigga's sound is elastic<br/>
Nigga, you can bite this, unless you wanna bite back<br/>
I didn't take my fuckin' Ritalin, this is a hype track<br/>
HypeTrack that and send it, nigga it's a sack shit<br/>
I had you motherfuckers eatin' salad like a fat bitch<br/>

Niggas at the fuckin' mall, niggas where my fuckin' drawers?<br/>
Think I'm happy? Think I'm sad? Bitch you fuckin' know my dad<br/>
He wears his pants up in his ass, touch his ass, grab his dick<br/>
You's a fag, you like that shit, O.F. is the fuckin' clique<br/>
I'm goin' off the top of the brain<br/>
Nigga don't know how to rap but I'm in the game<br/>
Fuck that shit, I don't give a fuck<br/>
I'm back up in the fuckin' club, niggas know I'm at the mall<br/>
Eatin' chips with my drawers, how you doing? How you fall?<br/>

Bitch I got that fuckin' swag, you don't know my fuckin' dad<br/>
I don't know my fuckin' dad, what is this a fuckin' purse?<br/>
I ain't fuckin' Mexican, but we can have sex again<br/>
With your sister with no rubber (Alexis' real name is Alex)<br/>
What the fuck? That's your fuckin' brother? I ain't with that jerkin' shit<br/>

My father died the day I came outta my mother's hole<br/>
And left the burden on my soul until I was old enough<br/>
To understand that the fuckin' faggot didn't like me much<br/>
He loved my moms enough to bust a nut and then he shake Junt<br/>
Bringin' pops to school today for twelve years I cheated<br/>
Told the fuckin' faculty that he was at a meeting and<br/>
Bring that dude to life then he wasn't at the meeting<br/>
Made a U-turn on the weather like the fuck am I thinking<br/>
Birthdays, Christmas my only fucking wishlish was CD's<br/>
And a new fitted instead I got some CD's<br/>
I hated, some Ritalin, some white socks<br/>
I was hyper cause I didn't get attention from my real pops<br/>
Cops say I'm supposed to be in jail but they don't know it's me<br/>
Statistics say that niggas with no father ain't go be shit<br/>
Well I guess I had one because nigga I'm it<br/>
You smell that? That's the odor of success bitch<br/>
<br/>
I know I'm not the only bastard, in America<br/>
So I'm gonna need some help, on this next part, scream it with me niggas<br/>
<br/>
Fuck you (I'm good)<br/>
Fuck you (I graduated)<br/>
Without you (I'm good)<br/>
Fuck you (I'm good)<br/>
Nigga eighteen (I'm good)<br/>
Fuck you (I'm good)<br/>
Got a car nigga (Fuck you)<br/>
Eat a dick nigga, bitch<br/>

Father's Day was the worst when it came to gifts<br/>
Cause I ain't know for who or what the fuck to get<br/>
Now my momma mentioned the day before she would like<br/>
Cause she's playin' both roles like her occupation was dyke, fuckin' right<br/>
I ain't look up to Obama and Nixon, I looked up to the Hugo's and Dixon's<br/>
The niggas in the vision rap about the shit they cookin' in the kitchen<br/>
Pushin' keys like them niggas that were bangin' on the Keynes<br/>
My father never seen me, the nigga probably Stevie<br/>
He bought me hoodie a couple albums<br/>
Like that's gonna make up the years and the tears<br/>
And the money that my momma spent on rent and clothes<br/>
You fuckin' dicked out, I swear to God if I see you<br/>
I'mma get out the M-16 and let a fuckin' clip out<br/>
Cause in 16 years, you let your kid down the existence, none<br/>
I don't give a fuck either like father like son I'm done<br/>
<br/>
He ain't give a fuck about me<br/>
He ain't give a fuck about you<br/>
He ain't give a fuck about we<br/>
So what the fuck we gon' do?<br/>

Fuck you (I'm good)<br/>
Fuck you (I graduated)<br/>

The cold is nice, and I ain't talkin' 'bout the weather<br/>
The skin is thick, no need for leather, your father called<br/>
He said you're better without him, I'm not the only fuck<br/>
Without them, how to tie a tie and how to get your suit hemmed up<br/>
Take it to the shop, then what?<br/>
Fuck it, mommas proud of her asmatic thin fuck<br/>
Luck on my brim Supreme keeps me warm<br/>
When the cold blood swarms in my veins, fuck rain in the summer<br/>
The bummer is the fact that I'm black<br/>
And I hang with white neos who's nero stays frio<br/>
Now this consulor is tryna tell me that I'm emo, she don't give a fuck<br/>

You wouldn't do that Tyler, kill yourself or anyone<br/>
You don't even have the balls to begin with<br/>
What you need is me, someone to talk to<br/>
Uh, it's been a while since our last session<br/>
So, tell me what's been going on<br/>
<br/>
I'm not a fucking role model (I know this)<br/>
I'm a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams<br/>
Since Kanye tweeted telling people he's bumping all of my shit<br/>
These mothafuckas think I'm supposed to live up to something? Shit<br/>
I'm still jacking off and proceeding my life careless<br/>
But getting more pussy cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris (as you should)<br/>
LA to Paris, I'm getting these weird stares<br/>
At skateparks and airports all in the air, it's weird<br/>
Yonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked<br/>
Now competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked<br/>
He still hasn't called me yet<br/>
But that's a whole fucking different argument, shit I got over it<br/>
And a couple bucks in my pockets, so now I could go buy<br/>
A couple hot pockets and grandmom could stop cooking<br/>
Them nasty ass collard greens, pressures on me like this top hat<br/>
Bastard intro, how the fuck I'm gonna top that?<br/>
<br/>
Made a couple thou and I just don't know what to buy yet<br/>
<br/>
The Preme shit is free, and I don't drink so fuck a wine set<br/>
Nigga fuck a mindset, my brain is an obscenity<br/>
I'm fucked in the head, I lost my mind with my virginity<br/>
Oh that's a triple three six, isn't he a devil worshiper<br/>
Cause I'm too fucking ignorant to do some research<br/>
I'm the star of the group<br/>
So no one else gets the respect that they deserve cause of you<br/>
(Bastard was good tho.) What you think I record it for?<br/>
To have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore?<br/>
Like I didn't make Parade or Inglorious<br/>
Cause I'm too scared to tell my friends the way I really fucking feel<br/>
Of course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin' off<br/>
In the tombs of Lara Croft, I'm getting pissed off<br/>
Message boards are on my dick, I need a pissing waiver<br/>
Let me bust one in they mouth, I know they feel the flavor<br/>
<br/>
People excited thinking shit is so tight (for what?)<br/>
Getting co-signs from rappers that I don't even like<br/>
What the fuck you want me to do? Start to gobble his mic<br/>
And start jacksing him off until his cack blasting off?<br/>
Fuck that, these niggas ain't fucking with me<br/>
Cause I don't listen to the immortal of tech of the nique<br/>
And all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak<br/>
On the Billboard Top 20 and Jam of the Week<br/>
I'd rather listen to Badu and Pusha the T<br/>
And some Waka Flocka Flame instead that real hip hop<br/>
That's bull of the sheet but they want to critique<br/>
Everything that we, Wolf Gang, has ever released<br/>
But they don't get it, (they dont, its not made for them) cause it's not made for them<br/>
The nigga that's in the mirror rapping, it's made for him<br/>
But they do not have the mindset, that same as him<br/>
I'm not weird, you're just a faggot, shame on him<br/>
<br/>
Therapist been sinnin' and niggas getting offended<br/>
They don't want to fuck with me, cause I do not fuck with religion<br/>
You see that's my decision, you fuckers don't have to listen<br/>
Here, put this middle finger in your ear<br/>
Someone gets blamed cause some white kid had aimed his AK-47 at 47 kids<br/>
I don't wanna see my name mentioned<br/>
<br/>
College wasn't working and I wasn't working<br/>
So I was at home jerking off until my dick was hurting<br/>
But I was determined to be great, so those classes can wait<br/>
For the four days that I went, I wasn't learning shit<br/>
Now I'm living dreams that I wanted since 8<br/>
I can afford to get something my mother on her birthday<br/>
<br/>
They claim the shit I say is just wrong<br/>
Like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone<br/>
I'm just a teenager, who admits he's suicide prone<br/>
My life is doing pretty good, so that date is postponed for now<br/>
Wow, life's a cute bitch full of estrogen<br/>
And when she gives you lemons nigga throw them at pedestrians<br/>
<br/>
I, still live in my grandma's house<br/>
Sell out a fucking show in London just to end up on couches<br/>
I hate my fucking life, but when I make that announcement<br/>
My hero calls my phone, just to put that in doubt then<br/>
Then I am confused if I want in or just out<br/>
My friends really think I'm playing when I say I need counseling<br/>
I sit in grandmother's living room and just pout<br/>
And shout loud inside, sometimes I just want to die (no you dont)<br/>
Odd Future came from the bottom<br/>
And it's gonna take a couple armed armies tryna stop 'em<br/>
All you fucking lames don't have to like me<br/>
The devil doesn't wear Prada, I'm clearly in a fucking white tee

<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I'm a fucking walking paradox – no, I'm not<br/>
Threesomes with a fucking triceratops, Reptar<br/>
Rapping as I'm mocking deaf rock stars<br/>
Wearing synthetic wigs made of Anwar's dreadlocks<br/>
Bedrock, harder than a motherfucking Flintstone<br/>
Making crack rocks outta pussy nigga fishbones<br/>
This nigga Jasper trying to get grown<br/>
About 5'7"" of his bitches in my bedroom<br/>
Swallow the cinnamon, I'mma scribble this sin and shit<br/>
While Syd is telling me that she's been getting intimate with men<br/>
(Syd, shut the fuck up) Here's the number to my therapist<br/>
(Shit) You tell him all your problems, he's fucking awesome with listening<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Jesus called, he said he's sick of the disses<br/>
I told him to quit bitching, this isn't a fucking hotline<br/>
For a fucking shrink, sheesh, I already got mine<br/>
And he's not fucking working, I think I'm wasting my damn time<br/>
I'm clocking three past six and going postal<br/>
This the revenge of the dicks, that's nine cocks that cock nines<br/>
This ain't no V Tech shit or Columbine<br/>
But after bowling, I went home for some damn Adventure Time<br/>
(What'd you do?) I slipped myself some pink Xannies<br/>
And danced around the house in all-over print panties<br/>
My mom's gone, that fucking broad will never understand me<br/>
I'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin<br/>
(What you think of Hayley Williams?) Fuck her, Wolf Haley robbing 'em<br/>
I'll crash that fucking airplane that that faggot nigga B.o.B is in<br/>
And stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus<br/>
And won't stop until the cops come in<br/>
I'm an overachiever, so how about I start a team of leaders<br/>
And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver?<br/>
Green paper, gold teeth and pregnant golden retrievers<br/>
All I want, fuck money, diamonds and bitches, don't need them<br/>
But where the fat ones at? I got something to feed 'em<br/>
It's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em<br/>
Snap back, green ch-ch-chia fucking leaves<br/>
It's been a couple months, and Tina still ain't perm her fucking weave, damn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
They say success is the best revenge<br/>
So I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in<br/>
Oh, not again! Another critic writing report<br/>
I'm stabbing any blogging faggot hipster with a Pitchfork<br/>
Still suicidal I am<br/>
I'm Wolf, Tyler put this fucking knife in my hand<br/>
I'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fucking hole in my head<br/>
And I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved the cock in your bitch<br/>
(What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G<br/>
I just want to know if my father would ever like me<br/>
But I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me<br/>
A motherfuckin' Goblin<br/>
(Fuck everything, man) That's what my conscience said<br/>
Then it bunny hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead<br/>
Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement<br/>
Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit, dead

Golden rubbers in these denim pockets (denim pockets)<br/>
On my waist, there's a black Glock (black Glock)<br/>
New girl moved on the block (on the block)<br/>
She been plottin' on my brown cock (brown cock)<br/>
Last night I slept over hers (over hers)<br/>
During sex, I overheard (I overheard)<br/>
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na<br/>
Rolled off the bed then shot back, pa-pa<br/>
Blood on the sheets probably spillin' from my gash<br/>
Looked out the glass, seen him sprintin' on the grass<br/>
A real ninja with the blade and the mask<br/>
Got them gold ninja stars and red Supreme nunchuks<br/>
Now she tryna patch me up, but<br/>
Girl, I was just tryna get a nutbust<br/>
If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol<br/>
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude<br/>

But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight<br/>
We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck<br/>
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one<br/>
But I give two for us 'cause you're the one that I want<br/>
Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that sips on the punk pussy<br/>
See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front<br/>
But in the back of my top I'm writing songs about we<br/>
We as including I and yourself, making three<br/>
Little ones drums beating pretty hard if you ask me<br/>
You're a pretty broad in the top three<br/>
Of things that I've been waiting to come, so<br/>
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then<br/>

<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Goddamn I love women<br/>
Daydream about penis being in 'em<br/>
Meet them with a big grin with a Mac-10<br/>
Rope, katana, and then I skin 'em<br/>
All beige suit made out of white women<br/>
With the red lipstick dancing to John Lennon<br/>
With the red sweater jeans made out of blue denim<br/>
They can catch me in the spot where the sun don't shine<br/>
Bitch don't mind me, shake your hiney<br/>
The only motherfucking Wolf here, I spit venom<br/>
You're a bad bitch with a real good kitten<br/>
And I got the appetite of them fat black women<br/>
Wolf Gang in this bitch with a bunch of rats with 'em<br/>
Lookin' like the holocaust with supreme hats with 'em<br/>
I am tryna get Ms. Piggy by the motherfucking hairs of her chinny chin chin<br/>
Umm, what's that? The cock of a black dude<br/>
Mad 'cause to start her, got the swag of a vacuum (Aww, fuck it)<br/>
I'll take her to the back room, dungeon, fighting and punching<br/>
And now the slut is under the fucking assumption<br/>
That I will be fucking and munching her muffin<br/>
Cum will be bleeding but that's not from the time signature of the month, umm<br/>

It's because I'm Dracula bitch<br/>
Don't got a problem smacking a bitch<br/>

Goddamn I love bitches<br/>
Especially when they only suck dick and wash dishes<br/>
Cooking, cleaning, grant my wishes<br/>
Make me and the Wolf Gang Sandwitches<br/>
Transylvania crypt let's take a, tour<br/>
Bitch try getting through that black trap, door<br/>
Keep yelling and working them vocal chords<br/>
And that'll be more of a reason that you'll get slapped up, for<br/>
Is that four trunks comfy? (Fuck you!) Fuck me? No, fuck Buffy<br/>
That little bitch keeps trying to hump me<br/>
Jumping over dicks what the fuck she want from me?<br/>
She keeps sending me garlic<br/>
How many times I gotta tell her I'm allergic (I like your cape)<br/>
Oh this baby ape cape?<br/>
Bitch I got it for a bargain at the neighborhood target<br/>
Fangs are sharp and I hope you know<br/>
That all I really want from you is that throat<br/>
I can't eat pussy 'cause I might leave cuts<br/>
Then there's blood on my sheets, but that might be a plus<br/>
On the channel a fucking animal, leaking like pairs of candles<br/>

<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
So, you tell me that everything just isn't going well<br/>
Well, first off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
My only problem is death<br/>
F*ck heaven, I ain't showing no religion respect<br/>
Brain damage, therapy's the only thing I regret<br/>
Talking to me is like a fucking body missing her neck<br/>
But, I'm surprised I ain't pop off my top off<br/>
Life is a bitch and my cock's off the Glock's cock<br/>
My hand's shriveled, my finger's slipped, the wall's red<br/>
Her life is fucked, she sad now, her son is dead<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I told her I'm her worst nightmare<br/>
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fear<br/>
My spirit floats around in the night air<br/>
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
When I was younger, I would smile a lot<br/>
I'm getting older, getting bolder but a wiser top<br/>
Now I'm drunk driving, lap's full of the Budweiser tops<br/>
Life is a movie and you're just a prop<br/>
They begged me to stop but I listen like death drones<br/>
Love? I don't get none, that's why I'm so hostile to the kids that get some<br/>
My father called me to tell me he loved me<br/>
I'd have a better chance of getting Taylor Swift to fuck me<br/>
I know again I'm ugly, most niggas wanna punch me<br/>
I'm surprised the fucking doctor even touched me<br/>
Feel like Humpty, you hoping that I'll fall? Fuck y'all<br/>
I'm Ace, I'm parentless, I'm kinda arrogant<br/>
Ignorant as fuck, defend people for the hell of it<br/>
Because I am the devil, fucker get on my level<br/>
Doughnuts and keys and kick-flips, Supremes and markers<br/>
My life is Ms. Mo Unique Parker, but a little darker, I'll see you in a couple<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I told her I'm her worst nightmare<br/>
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fear<br/>
My spirit floats around in the night air<br/>
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
Tyler, here's some water man<br/>
You seem a little tense.. how is Thebe?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
All because a nigga just don't give a fuck<br/>
Parents wanna blame me all because their kid is fucking up<br/>
But fuck that, you're shitty parents, face it, suck it up<br/>
That's what you shoulda did before that nigga bust, huh<br/>
Feel like I missed my little brother growing up<br/>
Feel like my little brother missed his brother growing up<br/>
But this is Golf Wang, like he missed his family growing up<br/>
I got a little taller since the last time you seen me, bro<br/>
Now I'm emo, so fuck it, I'm Poe-in' up<br/>
But I never had a drink, ""Sydney, Tyler's throwing up!""<br/>
My nigga Jasper said if I drink and get drunk enough<br/>
I won't feel the feeling I be feeling when I'm sobered up<br/>
But that's a fucking lie, why would he say that I'm<br/>
As emotionally strained as Travis when he's.. (Tyler, calm down)<br/>
Don't look at me, I'm 6'5"" about to fucking cry<br/>
About another guy, but this is Golf Wang, do or die<br/>
I finally had a family<br/>
Domo's in another state, where the fuck is Riley?<br/>
Now you niggas wanna be nice because the labels wanna sign me<br/>
But before the co-signing and you fuckers couldn't find me?<br/>
Fuck that! I hope you die in a fiery death<br/>
One ear I got kids screaming ""O.F. is the best""<br/>
The other ear I got Tron Cat asking where the bullets and the bombs at<br/>
So I can kill these levels of stress, shit<br/>
They say that I'm shock value<br/>
How about you hop off cock and turn volume down?<br/>
I haven't got around to telling my mom shit<br/>
Cause I don't know how to.. (Whoa)<br/>
All I want is her support, whenever the fight's at home<br/>
When mommy cusses out cousin, some knifes get shown<br/>
Now she's really fuckin' pissed, so the knives get thrown<br/>
And hit her in her fucking neck, now her throat's all gone<br/>
Looking like a fucking monster from the Twilight Zone<br/>
Then they wonder why I stay at Travis pad with a backpack<br/>
For the whole week full of plastic-wrapped black tees<br/>
And deodorant like this house is my home<br/>
I could live with the same hat<br/>
And the same flat-screen TV watching Flapjack<br/>
And the same bacon and waffles on a nice Saturday<br/>
Where I skate with the same fucking friends at<br/>
Didn't give a fuck about fame or a name, oh<br/>
""Message from GZA, oh, another one from Plain Pat""<br/>
Email full of emails, I never write back<br/>
Ain't kill myself yet, now I already want my life back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I told her I'm her worst nightmare<br/>
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fear<br/>
My spirit floats around in the night air<br/>
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4]</i><br/>
One shot, two shots, one gun, two cops<br/>
I'm blowin' them flu shots, couldn't kill me with two top rockers<br/>
You're on the side of faggots and cock blockers<br/>
I'm on the side of bad-ass kids and the top notches<br/>
I'm Barney, dinosaur Harley of a human<br/>
Cause I'm shrooming with the bangers and the carneys<br/>
You niggas can't harm me cause you all know that<br/>
We at the fuckin' dirty lifer's laundry (Tyler, calm down) nigga get off me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Fuck off me man, fuck (What's got into you?)<br/>
I don't know, it's like I'm a different person at times<br/>
Sometimes I'm fucking mad, sometimes I'm not (Yeah, you..)<br/>
As though I got a fucking voice in my head<br/>
Telling me to do all this fucked up shit, man (Yeah, what's this?)<br/>
I don't fucking know, man (What's this person named then, Tyler, huh?)<br/>
He tells me to do this shit that I don't wanna fucking do (What's his name?)<br/>

Satan's getting jealous of the wolves, the demons say they preferring us<br/>
Books on not giving a fuck is what they're referring us (Wolf Gang)<br/>
Wolves, I know you heard of us, we're murderers<br/>
And young enough to get the fucking priest to come and flirt with us<br/>
You niggas rap about fucking bitches and getting head<br/>
Instead I rap about fucking bitches and getting heads<br/>
While you niggas stacking bread, I can stack a couple dead<br/>
Bodies, making red look less of a color, more of a hobby<br/>
I'm not a rapper nor a rapist nor a racist<br/>
I fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit<br/>
Brag about the actions in a rhyming pattern matter<br/>
Then proceed to sat her down when I go splatter in her chatterbox<br/>
Atta boy, Odd Future, you're not in our category<br/>
Torture with the super soaker at the Asian liquor store<br/>
This the type of shit that make a Chris Brown want to kick a whore<br/>
That make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours<br/>
(Umbrella) I hate this, screaming fuck patience<br/>
Got a nigga shaking like the calmest fucking Haitian<br/>
After chronic masturbation, asking where Mary-Kate went<br/>
I want to be the reasons why all lesbians hate dick<br/>
I make this damn Bullwinkle the red moose<br/>
Game of duck-duck-duct tape with a dead goose<br/>
She running 'round this motherfucking dungeon, her legs loose<br/>
Until I accidentally get the saw to her head, oops<br/>
Victim, victim, honey, you're my fifth one<br/>
Honey on that topping when I stuff you in my system<br/>
Rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome<br/>
You got a fucking death wish? I'm a genie, it'll get done<br/>
Nice to meet you, but it's more pleasant to eat you<br/>
With a leaf of salad and some dressing pouring out a teacup<br/>
Bitch, I'm Tyler the Creature, suck your feet up like a beach of leeches<br/>
Rubber more than the fucking bottom of a sneaker<br/>
Jeeper the fucking creeper, get your daughter and keep her<br/>
In the jeeps where the Wolf Gang rides around deeper<br/>
Take her to Ladera, now she's scared and you're embarrassed<br/>
Filled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands<br/>
Put her eyes in a canteen, take her to the Berrics<br/>
Stare at Steve, say it costs ten to fuck Eric<br/>
Put her in the lake, her body sinks great, now it's time to fish her like Derek<br/>
Satan says we're dangerous, we're trading kids for angel dust<br/>
And snuff and sniff, and now that Michael Jackson's trying to suck our dick<br/>
Hippopot the fucking llamas, dead bodies, cheerleading squaders<br/>
Gave the team a bunch of fucking bees and the Keke Palmer<br/>
They will never catch him or catch up<br/>
They asked me what it was, I told them fuckers it was ketchup<br/>
Nutty like my Chex mix, she bleeding from her rectum<br/>
Odd Future wolves stirring ruckus, throwing sets up, yep<br/>
This the type of shit that make children break in apartments<br/>
When you tell a fucking orphan you don't love them 'til they heart thin<br/>
(I hate you!) Starve her 'til I carve her then I shove her in the Rover<br/>
Where I cut her like a barber with a Parkinson's disorder<br/>
Store her in a portable freezer with me to Portland<br/>
Catch me with a bunch of fucking Mexicans crossing the border (arriba!)<br/>
I'll be the only wetback who ain't really touched the water<br/>
Cause I'll be too fucking busy tryna flirt with Jesus' daughter<br/>
(Fuck Mary) I'm awesome, and I fuck dolphins<br/>
Sicker than the starving Nigerian kids barfing<br/>
Odd Future Wolf Gang Nazi bar mitzvah<br/>
With your sister at the bar playing leg and arm twister<br/>
Evident that I'm the shit, I'm the Pooh like Tigger dick<br/>
I got these cracker doctors saying, ""yeah Bob, this nigga's sick""<br/>
Animal safari, if I offend you I'm sorry<br/>
Because I'm the blackest skinhead since India Arie<br/>
I don't smoke weed, so no need for the matches<br/>
I said fuck coke and now I'm snorting Hitler's ashes<br/>
I plan on either dying for suicide or my asthma<br/>
Being the only bastard in a box logo casket<br/>
Rashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob Sagets<br/>
In some Kanye West glasses screaming out ""fuck faggots""<br/>
Catch me in my attic taking photos of my dad's dick<br/>
Drop the beat here to make it extra climactic<br/>

We talk every night, she cry to me about her guy<br/>
And if we text, I get pissed when I get no reply<br/>

I know that she's the key to love<br/>
She is who I'm thinking of when I am beating richard up <br/>
The mental images her face looked<br/>
The closest that I got was when I'm poking her on facebook<br/>
<br/>

Video chats are so exciting,<br/>
Cause it's like she is inviting me to her world full of privacy<br/>
I'm getting gassed up, I think she's liking me<br/>
She's gullible, and I just wanna take it like a pirate (aargh)<br/>
<br/>
(This girl)<br/>
I see her in class<br/>
Not really two doors down, but any time that I pass<br/>
To take a piss in a stall, I picture us in the hall<br/>
Locking lips on the wall, her hand grabbing my dick<br/>
My left hand on her tits, aw my shit's getting hard<br/>
Some thoughts of dating this bitch<br/>
<br/>
(It's this girl)<br/>
Her name is my password (...fuck)<br/>

All my niggas got they bitches and stuff<br/>
But all the bitches, they fuck<br/>
Are known as bitches and sluts<br/>
But she's special, I know to ya'll I come off as rough<br/>
But I'm the nicest to her, and I just want to concur<br/>
A relation, I want the cheesy dates at the movies<br/>
And stupid walks at the beach, and sharin' straws in a cup<br/>
I never had that, so when we holdin' hands walkin' home<br/>
I look past that, the fact she's fucking guys that I hate<br/>
But...<br/>

Things are looking great, cut copy<br/>
Last time that we talked, she said her relationship was rocky<br/>
Now that Mr. Fag is gone, there's no one that can stop me<br/>
From bagging her, I got these tickets to the Roxy<br/>
<br/>
(This girl)<br/>
Next day, metro's taking me home<br/>
I see her in a cut at wendy's, but she's not alone<br/>
Who's that guy, wait, why the fuck he 'bout to kiss her?<br/>
Come to find out she got back with her... nigga...<br/>
(Damn)<br/>
Damn...<br/>
Fuck...<br/>
<br/>
(It's this girl) <i>[x2]</i><br/>
She's so pretty, fuck self pity, I feel so shitty<br/>
I wanna text her in a jealous rage, but if she replied<br/>
Or say anything, I'mma smile, I know<br/>
<br/>
What do I do with myself? sit in my room for some days<br/>
Play xbox with piles full of wet socks, fuck that<br/>
<br/>
(This girl)<br/>
<br/>
My nigga asked ""ace, what happened to such and such?""<br/>
I could slander her name, and then, tell em' I probably fucked <br/>
Or I could tell em the truth and say she didn't like me much<br/>
But instead I lie and say she moved to nebraska...<br/>

Nigga had the fucking nerve to call me immature<br/>
Fuck you think I made Odd Future for?<br/>
To wear fucking suits and make good decisions?<br/>
Fuck that nigga, Wolf Gang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Tyler]</i><br/>
Who the fuck invited Mr. I Don't Give a Fuck<br/>
Who cries about his daddy and a blog because his music sucks? (I did!)<br/>
Well, you fucking up, and truthfully I had enough<br/>
And fuck rolling papers, I'm a rebel, bitch, I'm ashing blunts (Sorry)<br/>
Full of shit, like I ate that John<br/>
Come on kids, fuck that class and hit that bong<br/>
Let's buy guns and kill those kids with dads and mom<br/>
With nice homes, 41k's, and nice ass lawns<br/>
Those privileged fucks got to learn that we ain't taking no shit<br/>
Like Ellen Degeneres clitoris is playing with dick<br/>
I'm jealous as shit, cause I ain't got no home meal to come to<br/>
So, if you do, I'm throwing fingers out screaming ""fuck you""<br/>
I got ten of these Kennedy's<br/>
Not Dom, but if I was a Dahm, I would be Jeffery<br/>
'preme hat the color of a leprechaun with leprosy<br/>
I'm fucking 'bout it, 'bout it, like I'm Master P in '96<br/>
It's fucking immaculate, the way your daughter smacking dicks<br/>
Surprised she hasn't taked the nasty dick inside her alley you<br/>
The Golf Wang hooligans, is fucking up the school again<br/>
And showing you and yours that breaking rules is fucking cool again<br/>
I'm going harder than a midget jumping over me<br/>
Chronic youth, I'm shoving blunt wraps in bitches ovaries<br/>
Punches to the stomach where that bastard kid supposed to be<br/>
Fuck a mask, I want that ho to know it's me, ugh<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Hodgy]</i><br/>
My love is gone for you mommy, you could ride in hearses<br/>
I'm sick in the brain dumb bitch, can you nurse this?<br/>
You told me life would never, ever, ever get this perfect<br/>
Then you smoke a J of weed, and take his kids to the churches<br/>
Uh, fuck church, they singing and the shit ain't even worth it<br/>
In the choir, whores and liars, scumbags and the dirt, bitch<br/>
You told me God was the answer<br/>
When I ask him for shit, I get no answer, so God is the cancer<br/>
I'm stuck in triangles, looking for my angel<br/>
Kill me with a chainsaw, and let my balls dangle<br/>
Triple six is my number, you can get it off my Tumblr<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 3: Hodgy]</i><br/>
It was hilarious, well it ain't fucking funny now<br/>
I'll push this fucking pregnant clown into a hydrant stuck in the ground<br/>
I step through the stomach, replace the baby with some fucking pounds<br/>
""My baby daddy shoot bricks, the nigga also shoot rounds""<br/>
Cause if I shoot blanks, oops, thanks<br/>
I'm right back in it dead yummy and her mildew stank<br/>

<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Slip it in her drink and in the blink<br/>
Of an eye I can make a white girl look chink<br/>
Don't know what to think, cause last time<br/>
I attempted this shit the judge ordered me to see a shrink<br/>
Started with a link, intended her to meet me<br/>
At the local Odd Future Wolf Gang skatin' rink<br/>
We be uniquely in sync, already fuckin' and we only met last week<br/>
We're both young, not yet antique<br/>
So her mindset was workin' for my technique<br/>
Tell her that I love her and by next week<br/>
You can hear her shriek from the gashes in her cheeks<br/>
Well, I'm not a freak, I am meekly a creep that<br/>
Neighbors by the creek say that my house stinks<br/>
It reeks of a street girl, streaks of red, even though all pussy is pink<br/>
Oblivion makes obvious seeks<br/>
Which makes meats for my obvious feasts<br/>
Used to just blot up,thoughts plot and rethink<br/>
Now I get daughters and time in the clink<br/>
Got my dick harder than iron and zinc<br/>
Now they just rot up, arms caught in the sink<br/>
Where they get cut up, too fit, my physique<br/>
Critique my chic in this brand new mink, go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Bitches runnin' round down pussy take a trip<br/>
Make you strip, got my dick harder than the unzipped<br/>
Tyler swiftly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift's slit<br/>
Round trip in that pussy, here comes a ticket<br/>
Film clips poppin' on that cannon, bustin' odd mind cannons<br/>
On the pill, is he real? Gaza strippin'<br/>
In my livin' room, Wolf Gang full moon<br/>
I'm assumin' mushrooms, I'm a necrolampoon<br/>
Not of Charles Mansoon, this fuck is endin' soon, because I'm ejaculatin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
Now I'd like to take this time of day to thank the Mother Earth<br/>
Letting the sun shine down on the lake while I fish the waters<br/>
Ooh, hide your daughters, hide your sisters, hell hide grandmama too<br/>
Cause the fisherman's raping everybody in the pool, he on the loose, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Gotta wash you down, all this gold is fuckin' bathing<br/>
Wait 'til you see semen’s swimming, baby please not pass on all these great wolves<br/>
Your body's near the coral reef, once upon a time came home with me<br/>
Then the next chapter left her upon my teeth<br/>
Fill your gills with goo, going deeper than Pacific Ocean<br/>
This specific motion makes this hammerhead puke<br/>
Gotta wear a wetsuit, can’t get seasick<br/>
I love when you wear fishnets, you want me to eat you<br/>
You’re fucking wet, fish

<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
So I met this girl at the club<br/>
And I just wanted her to suck my dick<br/>
And that's cause<br/>
She's a boppin' bitch <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Now she's drunk and talkin' to me a lot<br/>
Until we go to another room<br/>
And that's cause<br/>
She's a boppin' bitch <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
This little slut whore sucks cock for a little more bucks<br/>
Than a mother slut fucks for, real easy<br/>
Cause I didn't even knock on the front door<br/>
I used the welcome mat as a cum rag<br/>
And all the Wolves fucked her too, yeah she’s a comeback<br/>
Fill her with a bunch of shit I purchased at the drug store<br/>
Four more door looking sluts let me explore<br/>
Till my cock got sore and started growing cold sores<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Now she thinks that I like her<br/>
But all I really wanted was that mouth<br/>
And that's cause<br/>
She's a boppin' bitch <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Now she text messages me every day<br/>
And I don't ever hit that bitch back<br/>
And that's because<br/>
She's a boppin' bitch <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
This little hoodrat started jockin at my jock strap<br/>
Until my uncircumcised penis finally unwrapped<br/>
Flapping up and down until the cack finally go splat<br/>
Now you gotta spat, spit it out until you scat<br/>
Then you gotta sat and shit it out, bitch, fuck your feelings<br/>
You wasn’t feeling shit when you was down there kneeling<br/>
Now shut the fuck up you got another dick to deal with<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Now why can't we fuck with this bitch? (She's boppin')<br/>
Wait, tell him why we can’t fuck with this bitch? (That bitch is boppin')<br/>
What is she? She a BB, what does that stand for? (She boppin')<br/>
She, what does she be doin'? (She boppin')<br/>

So when we separate everything fine, her phone ringin' in her purse<br/>
Damn right it's me, I'm her nigga, nigga<br/>
Comformizing summer time I'm where's that drink, nigga<br/>
Catch us where the beach at, she wanna go shopping<br/>
Sun down after club cause she like to get it popping<br/>
Sangria on my feet mom, cause she likes to get it popping<br/>
No ecstasy for her but she wanna get it popping<br/>
Drop topping, I measure her pleasure<br/>
Then drop in when she get out of place I quantinize<br/>
She is my concubine, I am her porcupine<br/>
I poke her face her throat for taste, give me head like I'm on her mind<br/>
I know her analyzation so when she try to fake it<br/>

For some reason I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper<br/>
But, I just brought all your friends to talk to you<br/>
Because, they're really worried about you<br/>
I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Domo]</i><br/>
It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines<br/>
When I rhyme I'm tryna get pictures in High Times<br/>
Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the sky line<br/>
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime<br/>
In my mind I'm just tryna smoke the finest<br/>
And get high sticking bad heinas in vaginas<br/>
I'm the flyest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit<br/>
I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this<br/>
I'm a stoner yeah, yeah, yeah you get the picture now<br/>
30 thousand feet gonna make it hard for me to simmer down<br/>
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow<br/>
Thus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out<br/>
Where we at? We on top of the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Frank]</i><br/>
And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park<br/>
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back<br/>
Hurling himself and cars, and flirting with blonde Cadillacs<br/>
All was great, all was great, Frankie had the blues in fact<br/>
Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat<br/>
Teenage males, couldn't tell, I was going through<br/>
And had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Beamer almost black<br/>
Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at<br/>
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel<br/>
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt<br/>
Bet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back<br/>
We live inside a house that says fuck 'em on the welcome mat<br/>
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter that's<br/>
Where I'm at? Now where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Hodgy]</i><br/>
Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team<br/>
Hell yeah I smoke weed cause I like to go green<br/>
Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed<br/>
Shine chandelier bright mike, if your nose bleeds<br/>
We at Randy's ordering that 306<br/>
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me<br/>
Your bitch is coming along, yeah she hum to my song<br/>
Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur<br/>
No longer, but we working, premature, immature<br/>
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt<br/>
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door<br/>
Chased an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption<br/>
Impregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion<br/>
Where we at? We on top of the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Mike]</i><br/>
Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing<br/>
Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend<br/>
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade<br/>
They say life switches pace when you got shit made<br/>
So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days<br/>
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane<br/>
And too often they think that they could stop me<br/>
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati<br/>
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi<br/>
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me<br/>
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey<br/>
Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard<br/>
I got the world saying every single Friday is black<br/>
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, cause she know<br/>
Where we at nigga? We on top of the world<br/>

<i>[Verse 5: Tyler]</i><br/>
Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh<br/>
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth Sir<br/>
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt<br/>
Since I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fucking pervert<br/>
My window is a book and I'm a fucking crook<br/>
Stealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook<br/>
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either<br/>
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet but when I do<br/>
Clancy and Dave are to take a percentages that<br/>
Could pay the whole city's fucking mortgage<br/>
Hopefully I make a lot porn from touring in fucking Oregon<br/>
From playing piano organs and hopefully I can pay the bill<br/>
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel<br/>
Like I'm changing, but their complaining making big fucking deals<br/>
About some shit, they bitch and pout (Can we get backstage man?)<br/>
No, faggot, it's sold out (Come on why you holding out<br/>
I though we was boys, without me, you wouldn't be Tyler the Creator<br/>
You're from the Derby, I can tell whenever you perform<br/>
A leopard can't change it's spots) But I'm a fucking unicorn<br/>
(Whatever man) Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full monty<br/>
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi<br/>
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be<br/>
And I be where, anybody cares<br/>
I try to preach ""Fuck age, live dreams, and have fun""<br/>
(Here’s some give a fuck, cake) Oh, maybe I should have some<br/>
(Asshole, have none) How can I wake up on the wrong side<br/>
Of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?<br/>
When I'm on that stage I feel important<br/>
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin<br/>
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him<br/>
You gotta be fucking kidding me<br/>
At school I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero<br/>
And they fear it when they hear it when that little fucker's reciting my lyrics<br/>
Yeah rebel nigga cheer it, dead parents everywhere<br/>
It's smelling like teen spirit.. okay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building

<i>[Intro: Dr. TC]</i><br/>
Tyler you obviously have some fucking problems<br/>
And this is the end of this session, let's anything else you've gotta say?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Mom is getting jealous I see my manager more<br/>
Than I see her before, I go on tour and it hurts<br/>
I miss the days when this was fun but now it turned into work<br/>
They getting legal, so now I gotta watch the shit that I blurt out<br/>
My friends are turning into opposites<br/>
Because my life is turning into opposite of sloppy wrist<br/>
And all the bitches who forget about me want to ride my dick<br/>
Harder than the white kids that copy shit<br/>
Ending it is all I fucking think about, that's the shit I think about<br/>
All alone, bawling 'til my mothafuckin' eyes bleed<br/>
See, he's a leader in person and smile, shit gets disgursting<br/>
When there's no person around, talking discussion shit, man<br/>
F*ck, I'm putting myself at a distance<br/>
For instance, my best friend is now my fucking assistant<br/>
Niggas saying ""Free Earl"" without even knowin' him<br/>
See, they're missing the new album, I'm missing my only friend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
When I say Odd, y'all say Future<br/>
Odd.. uh-uh, that shit's corny as fuck<br/>
(Tyler, you have a cult following)<br/>
To these white kids?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Charbroiled nigga on these dark beats<br/>
Nashes with the Nazis but it's normal what the cops see<br/>
Awesome at his concert, but he never had a pop, see<br/>
Mommy was a living single queen with a lot tee<br/>
So while my wallet's piling with some symbolic colored paper<br/>
I lace her, cause she gave me such a lot at such a young age<br/>
20, why didn't she get that abortion?<br/>
Probably cause that motherfuckin embryo was morphing<br/>
Into a Grammy winning schizophrenic fucking orphan<br/>
Oops I meant bastard, a skinny ass disaster<br/>
Mom works hard, still working on her masters<br/>
Son lies about, taking classes at community college<br/>
Just to record some bullshit he calls Bastard<br/>
Start a fuckin cult, clash his talents in a brash way<br/>
Before he even had a mustache and cash<br/>
And all I got was a fuckin' shitty article in Thrasher<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
I'm not crazy, I'm a fucking table, I'm a fucking table!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I'mma grab the Nina and find a nice arena<br/>
Cause I can’t even choose between Ortega or Suprema<br/>
And I’m not even human, I’m a body shaped demon<br/>
With some semen in my sack and some problems in the back<br/>
And a life that’s full of crap, and a finger filled with hate<br/>
And a gat that’s filled with love, now let opposites attract<br/>
I can finally be one like a marriage in a church<br/>
But this marriage has a hearse and the parents of the one<br/>
That’s getting married has a curse and it’s made up inside of him<br/>
Too late to reimburse but, wait it gets worse<br/>
All the guests that’s in the church, all decided to disperse<br/>
So there was nobody who could stop the wedding with converse<br/>
So they tied the knot, now it’s too late to reverse<br/>
This arrangement (Yes it is) and the nurse is amazed at the hurt<br/>
That he was painting but it was obvious in all the photos<br/>
He was paining, now a bunch of whispering immerse<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
And then the nurse blurts<br/>
(What the fuck is his problem, here, we have two doses to give him, here)<br/>
Why didn’t anybody ask him first?<br/>
(I’ve been asking you this whole time)<br/>
Because nobody gave a fuck<br/>
(Someone gave a fuck Tyler<br/>
And, uh, the person that gave a fuck was me<br/>
See, you’re not, going crazy, it’s me, I’m your best friend Tyler<br/>
I know everything, I know everything about you<br/>
You’ve been helping yourself this whole time<br/>
Your friends, they’re just figments of your imagination<br/>
Dr. TC, see Tyler, I’m your conscience<br/>
I’m Tron Cat, I’m Ace, I’m Wolf Haley, I’m..)<br/>

<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Nigga this is my cup, drink the cyanide up<br/>
Dope as fuck so I would really shoot a group of guys up<br/>
Deep thought, I'm often lost (Fuck it) put me next to awesome<br/>
Still can't tell the difference, just like Asians with their eyes shut<br/>
Butt fuck a couple rocks, in the Wendy's parking lot<br/>
Barking at the sight of light from my bright sparkling<br/>
Cock-a-doodle, eatin' toaster strudel at a nude beach in Rome<br/>
In a black-pink spaghetti strap, made of Roman noodles<br/>
My bitch is bad, mixed with a thicky ass<br/>
Get my dicky rocky this will end up in a sticky blast<br/>
Chrissy Brown, mask on my face, now I'm kicking ass<br/>
Life's a bitch, fuck college, mommy I am ditching class<br/>
I rather be happy then fucking forty<br/>
So fuck the teacher's lecture I'm having Sydney record me<br/>
For the 2Dope.. (They didn't like it)<br/>
Oh well, let's get XXL to write us a fucking story<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Hodgy]</i><br/>
It's sitting right in my lap I see it, scribbled across the lines I read it<br/>
I'm the fucking poet who knows it, you know it, you bogus<br/>
Comprehend the language, you scared of war?<br/>
I'm all anxious, we got the Angus if you want beef<br/>
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga (Slice the onions)<br/>
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga (Put on the cheese)<br/>
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga (Where's the barbeque sauce?)<br/>
Now have that burger eat it fast nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Fucking all, get you some, obviously intended pun<br/>
Same time it took, Jason Dill to get the stitching done<br/>
Custom made, one of one, sold out Roxy for some months<br/>
Ski mask color of a pickle just to perform Sandwitches<br/>
Started back in fucking London cracker children wanted something<br/>
They could bump and punch a bunch and fuck a face stumble<br/>
Now, moshing pits to breaking arms, Zombie Circus not a carn<br/>
Evil wolfs is on the farm and were all evil harmed?<br/>
Any sheep creep, quiet tendered sleep<br/>
Make a peep, fucking body will go missing in a week<br/>
Roam around the city with her titties like a fucking Greek<br/>
God, Bastard was the shit, explains why it never leaked<br/>
I am coming of my age with my Memphis Bleek<br/>
Shooting from the sky, the only problem is the missing beak<br/>
(Once I have my wings and my motherfucking chain)<br/>
Oh that's the black talking in me, let me down a couple cups of bleach<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Free Earl, that's the fucking shit<br/>
And if you disagree, lick a couple pimple covered clits<br/>
From some stripping lesbian dikes that fight niggas<br/>
That like to rap about those dikes that fight niggas<br/>
Alright, enough with this shit, let's talk business<br/>
Acquire more currency, disregard bitches<br/>
Go to Shake house and plant Goblins in his kitchen<br/>
Then force him and his mom to listen to track six then<br/>
If he doesn't like it I'll just slice his fucking dick and<br/>
Put it in the cabinet where the fucking cookies and chips is<br/>
Take a bunch of pictures then post them on my Twitters and<br/>
Go to Jimmy Fallon like faggot when we perfomin'<br/>
Then a bunch of Golf Wang niggas start stormin' on the stage<br/>
In a rage that will scare Zack Rocha<br/>
Better get ya tanks before this wolf wars over<br/>
History repeats itself, I'm a O.F. soldier

Rollin' in a golden Tacoma, the shit's stolen<br/>
If that bitch tell on me, I'ma do a fuckin' drive-by in her colon<br/>
With my meat, gotta keep it obsolete<br/>
Like Chris Brown when Rihanna got her fuckin' ass beat<br/>
Fuck Jeeves ask me for advice, if I'm not reading advice<br/>
I'm squatting down, picking cracker bitches scalp for some lice<br/>
Everything that I write is dope because the pipe<br/>
And nope you can't have a hit unless you gimme the light<br/>
We be burnin' dirty rocks with a light switch<br/>
Bitch nigga, you about as hard as a dikes clit<br/>
I'm goin' as hard as Bishop Eddie Longs John<br/>
After I bought a Sidekick and sent that fag some nice pics<br/>
They say I try too goddamn hard<br/>
No shit, I want a Grammy you damn retard<br/>
You can't be great when you settle for flea bargain<br/>
Unless you're a thrift hipster bitch in a leotard<br/>
Painless, Hodgy lost his motherfucking mind because the brain left<br/>
Wolf Gang got the ink on me now it's banged out<br/>
Box Logo hoodie, still haven't got the stains out<br/>
Congress, ah yes, I'm fuckin' with the best blondes<br/>
Um yes, I am now beating off to mom sex<br/>
Raquel is wrestling a prom dress<br/>
While me and Ray Charles have a fucking staring contest<br/>
To all the step dads in here<br/>
Triple six kids got you motherfuck scared<br/>
Could be worse, nigga that's absurd<br/>
Nigga I am at Pharrell's tryna butt fuck nerds<br/>
This just in, Tyler the Creator and Justin Bieber<br/>
Was just in the room flippin' Selena Gomez<br/>
Go 'head, give some, pucker up<br/>
I'll fuck her up until the kids come in, umm<br/>
After Tron Cat I got the rat shook and I ain't even have a hook<br/>
For the white kids to sing along<br/>
I don't wanna sing a song, fuck that<br/>
Now cyber bully sissies on my little sister's MacBook<br/>
I got you niggas nervous like a pop<br/>
Tryna ask a virgin how a vegan daughter where the cock goes<br/>
Wake up, wash ass, go and eat some Rosco's<br/>
Head back to the studio and munch up on some tacos<br/>
When I was younger I was bitchin' in<br/>
Now I'm coming quicker than the shit that's swimmin' in my sock hole<br/>
When them teeny boppers ain't around so Johnson and Johnson baby lotion<br/>
Bead on my Johnson till my cock swole<br/>
Stop sayin' sick shit it's kinda old<br/>
I'm a fucking Herpe in a coma you're a common cold<br/>
Have you heard my brother verse on Llama?<br/>
When that nigga's home, me, him and Hodgy gonna take the game and<br/>
Get a stainless steel AK and aim it<br/>
To the fucking referees head and put his lifeless body<br/>
In a choke hold, uh-oh, these niggas is loco<br/>
Best thing smokin' is all of the tobacco<br/>
Still hard to be black well<br/>
Malcolm X would be proud this white bitch is getting black mailed<br/>
Blue wide cracker named Ginny, and skinny<br/>
And Obama wanted change, I threw a couple fucking pennies at him<br/>
Just a chip off the old block<br/>
Chipped tooth got some dick off my swole cock<br/>
Cause I bag bitches, she's a zip off the old lock<br/>
And that's just a logo on the center of that old box<br/>
Oh stop, tryna be me, kids will go cop anything<br/>
That I put on from the gold watch to the boxers that I put on<br/>
Probably cause I'm goin harder than erect cock dick through a botox<br/>
Oh shit, you're as hard as senior citizens dick<br/>
Oh fuck, don't slip break hips and pop backs<br/>
Show some respect to old chaps with my left fist<br/>
Cause I'm the next best spitting wreck thats left here<br/>
That's my ex bitch, heard she's my next bitch<br/>
Have you met her mouth? No? Oh that's my bestest<br/>
Bestie, and she gets beastie<br/>
And she's my favorite babysitter cause the children never exit<br/>
I was taught to act my shoe size, I'm eleven and a half<br/>
Cock the umbrella cause when I spit Seven on your ass<br/>
It's gonna be mid stage Coachella<br/>
Shake faggot ass keep hatin'<br/>
But I work hard for the shit that I got<br/>
So I still fuck 2DopeBoyz and fuck Planet Earth<br/>
All associates can suck cock

<i>[Verse 1 – Tyler, the Creator]</i><br/>
Papa ain't call even though he saw me on Tv, it's all good (fuck you)<br/>
But now my balls, balls deep in this broads jaws, swallow girl, it's just nutt'<br/>
Bitches scared to let me smash on they ass<br/>
Yeah they heard I'm fuckin' nuts like the swag of a fag<br/>
Like me and Tekeli was gagging in the back of the cabin<br/>
Camp Floggnaw nigga you can tell by the badge<br/>
(pass me my inhaler)<br/>
I'm sick of hacking and coughing, I'm often this fucking awesome<br/>
I'm animals, Noah's arking, often just rapping nonsense<br/>
Four stories in my home like ""What the fuck's an apartment?""<br/>
Get shit popping like Peter's pores during puberty<br/>
And take bets on how quickly Tyler can reach maturity<br/>
Cussing out Siri like a waitress with no patience<br/>
Oh, you want a tip bitch, well here's my dick for gratiturity, bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook – Tyler, the Creator]</i><br/>
Shut em' down!<br/>
Nigga shut em' down!<br/>
Shut em' down!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 – Hodgy Beats]</i><br/>
I tumble crush on hudgy sluts, give money up then nutty, but<br/>
Professor Nutty Buddy Clumpkin's petty when you touch his lunch<br/>
Like ""What the fuck? I'm drunk as fuck,"" turn the fucking music up<br/>
So I can hear these stupid fucks, talk no walk, like you discussed<br/>
You talking too much, ""Who the fuck are you to us, uterus?""<br/>
I put that on my pubes and nuts, if I don't begin moving up, I'm shooting up<br/>
You and her, crew on turf, new dessert<br/>
I can see the bitch in a nigga through his shirt<br/>
I can smell the ho in the bitch flocking 'round my crew to flirt<br/>
It's on your shoulder, lose the dirt, yeah, it's the movement first<br/>
Fuck a human nurse, I'm ill I use this earth, to infuse the birth<br/>
Of my scrotum on the Channel 10 news, my only motive is to skip to my lou<br/>
Get hip to the pew, you can drink piss and eat a dick in a few<br/>
The sickening view, a visual woose, I eat your ribs, I'm a wolf<br/>
Then meet your kids afterschool and give 'em drugs 'cause it's cool (fucker)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook – Tyler, the Creator]</i><br/>
Shut em' down!<br/>
Nigga shut him down!<br/>
Shut em' down!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 – Tyler, the Creator]</i><br/>
Hodgy, fuck this beat, nigga let's smoke weed<br/>
That shit I need, be the shit that's green, a little purple and pink<br/>
Get some swisher sweets, about three up, four more, then leave it be<br/>
I got a eigth I could face, I got a blunt flavored grape<br/>
I hate the grape I can taste it when I'm inhaling the vapes<br/>
You can smell us in places when we walk<br/>
And our clothing is always covered in flakes<br/>
Enough for two shake blunts and ""What the fuck is this?""<br/>
I think this mary is laced, my heart is beating at paces<br/>
that Pacquiao can relate I'm fucking faded like gradient<br/>
Shit I'm stuck like the tape that's superglued<br/>
To the center of Kelly Price first waist.<br/>
It's like my first date with Mrs. Mary, this shit is scary<br/>
The paranoia from this marijuana is very heavy, I'm lifted<br/>
Fainted by my fifth hit, Lionel pass the sherm<br/>
Let's use this Philly as a dipstick for this bath salt, you dipshit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Domo Genesis]</i><br/>
C'mon my nigga you don't even smoke, you weak as fuck my nigga<br/>
You do not smoke, no tux my nigga, you're as weak as.. F- your butt my nigga...<br/>
Oh mark ass nigga, G- Oh my god bro,<br/>
Here comes that weak ass nigga Samuel.

<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Knock-knock, mothafuck it's me, Mr. Clusterfuck<br/>
What, when, where, how, like who gives a fuck<br/>
Golf Wang M-O-B, mopping niggas ante up<br/>
Ain't been this fucking sick since brain cancer ate my Granny up<br/>
Rest in peace or lie in it, life ain't got no light in it<br/>
Darker than that closet that nigga Frankie was hiding in<br/>
Open it, dope in it, Bobby where's my fucking pipe?<br/>
Dress my little dick as Ike, twenty says I hit your wife<br/>
This is life, truthfully I just want to fly some kites<br/>
Grab Salem and Slater and go around, riding bikes<br/>
Get some ice cream, Golf Wang Roscoe's for the night<br/>
To skate around and do annoying shit that older peeps despise<br/>
Nigga fuck it though, going hard as riga mo<br/>
Got a nigga dollars and a couple cracker kids at shows<br/>
Cracked a couple kids in the head with this cast<br/>
Had a blast out Europe, had a Swedish bitch licking toes<br/>
That's how it goes, designing clothes<br/>
Cats on everything, cats on everything<br/>
You think all this money will make a happy me?<br/>
But I'm 'bout as lonely as crackers that supermodels eat<br/>
Everybody's sparking but me, and I keep coughing<br/>
Can't keep calm in this spot's hot box and I'm getting nauseous<br/>
Hop in the car, ride to Saugus, and head straight to the office<br/>
Pissed off at Jasper because that's some faggot shit called ""Pink Dolphin""<br/>
I roll here on a mean unicorn<br/>
Green hat, Vans, Golf top is the team uniform<br/>
Downing that Capri Sun, tighten my bandana up<br/>
Something like a lez, I'm forgetting my damn manners cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I am the cowboy on my own trip<br/>
And I am the cowboy on my own trip<br/>
And I am the cowboy on my own trip<br/>
And I am the cowboy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
When you're alone thoughts start coming in<br/>
Punching in that dark lock box and they start rummaging<br/>
Shit you've got to battle with, wishing they could skedaddle<br/>
But it makes your shadow say none, fun and grab the gun again<br/>
I needed to get out of the house<br/>
So I hit the Dead Sams, and we went biking it out<br/>
In a black hoodie, with an Arizona and a bag of Skittles<br/>
Just to see what all that fucking hype is about<br/>
Now everytime you see a roach you think of me, ay?<br/>
Cause everytime I see one I think what his parents would say<br/>
In court saying I ate him, I wasn't present that day<br/>
I was with Whitney smoking, sitting at the dock of the bay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Do you know how weird it is knowing I make a bunch of cheese<br/>
While my friends can't afford little pizzas from Little Caesars<br/>
And their whole goal is to roll up and smoke bowls<br/>
So I don't feel bad when they not eating<br/>
(But you still treating us, you punk bitch)<br/>
Wolf Haley got more methods than Pinkman<br/>
I'm never civil, fuck Lincoln, 'Preme out the bag it's no wrinkles<br/>
I'm okie dokie and loopy and booboo nana and caca<br/>
If you think I'm fucking koo-koo, try talking to my shrink then<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Skit]</i><br/>
Dr. TC: Hey<br/>
Wolf: Bitch<br/>

<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I was 16 when we first laid eyes<br/>
Scrawny little fucker yeah I was that guy<br/>
And you was down for the weekend<br/>
I was down for the greeting<br/>
And your eyes the same color shit that jasper be chiefing<br/>
Couple freckles on ya noses, roses made you blush<br/>
Gentleman I was like I wasn't tryna fuck<br/>
But it was my first offical date so I was stuck like<br/>
It was past curfew, and we was at the grove<br/>
And it was raining, and I had to be home<br/>
And then you grabbed my hand, talking about trying to get home safe<br/>
All I remember, was your motherfucking face, your face<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I play in your hair<br/>
As you rub on my ears<br/>
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked<br/>
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked<br/>
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked<br/>
Feels like I’m floating in air<br/>
Can't you believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked<br/>
Man this feels like a dream because our lips locked<br/>
You officially put my feelings inside a ziplock bag<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
You gotta a nigga sprung, whenever I’m holding your hand<br/>
And making eye can-tact I feel like the damn man<br/>
Cause even though I am and get round of applauses<br/>
I’m insecure then I start to think that I do not stand chance<br/>
But, moments, wish that I could own em or lease it or clone it<br/>
Because holding your fingertips is golden.<br/>
I fucking love you, I treat my problems like a bowling ball &amp;<br/>
I grip and keep holding on<br/>
Girl?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
You got a nigga sprung<br/>
Wait, don't think this is going to work<br/>
Things got complicated and a couple feelings got hurt<br/>
I haven’t talked to you in a couple of days,<br/>
I got too comfortable and started to think we were really a couple<br/>
But hey at least it was time spent.<br/>
But by the time you will hear this you will know what these rhymes meant<br/>
But when you realize its awkward your names still my password<br/>
So I’m always fuckin' reminded<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Tyler &amp; Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
You're my Girlfriend.. you're my Girl (Whether you like it or not!)<br/>
You're my girl.. you're my girlfriend, you're my Girl Girlfriend<br/>
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my Girl (Shit I know that you're my)<br/>
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girlfriend<br/>
You're my girl.. oooo<br/>

Swag, 2011<br/>
Young Nigga<br/>
<br/>
Sick to my motherfucking tummy<br/>
Bitch must think I'm a motherfucking dummy<br/>
Because I dress bummy, bitch think I'm broke<br/>
Bitch, I ate one roach and I made a lot of money<br/>
Popping since Bastard, (manager) Clancy's my slave master<br/>
Thanks to them crackers, my pockets are fatter than excess shit that's weighing on Jasper<br/>
I've never popped a bottle, but I've fucked a couple models in Europe<br/>
Yup, and a couple of them swallowed<br/>
Meet me half way, bitch I'm going all in<br/>
And I never pull back, shout-out to my nigga Taco<br/>

Fuck that, Golf Wang<br/>
Fuck that, Golf Wang<br/>

<br/>
So, a couple fags threw a little hissfit<br/>
Came to Pitchfork with a couple Jada Pinkett signs<br/>
And said I was a racist homophobic<br/>
So I grabbed Lucas and filmed us kissing<br/>
Feelings getting caught, it's off, I'm pissing<br/>
You think I give a fuck? I ain't even stick my dick in yet<br/>
(No homo. Too soon.)<br/>
And while y'all are rolling doobies<br/>
I be in my bedroom scoring movies<br/>
Still excited like a fucking newbie<br/>
Suck my dick, motherfucker, sue me<br/>
Mom got a new whip so she could scoop me<br/>
A year ago, I ain't have no hoopty<br/>
Four story home, gotta climb eight set of stairs<br/>
Just to see where my fucking roof be<br/>
<br/>
Fuck that, Golf Wang<br/>
Fuck that, Golf Wang<br/>

Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)<br/>
Fuck that, Golf Wang<br/>

Fuck that, Golf Wang<br/>

<br/>
Wait a God damn second<br/>
I'm tripping balls, David Beckham<br/>
Would fall cause shit's going down<br/>
Just like Rodney King swimming lessons<br/>
Now me and Justin smoke sherm and been talking 'bout freeing perms<br/>
And purchasing weapons, naming them and aim 'em in One Direction<br/>
(Wait a minute)<br/>
It sounds like midgets in a God damn speaker<br/>
Anytime you play this shit loud<br/>
But that's just me trying to get milk now<br/>
And the grunts of the god damn cow<br/>
Hit me on my beeper while Captain Hook suck my Peter<br/>
Pan camera, repeat procedure<br/>
And when the beat drop, have a goddamn seizure<br/>

Fuck that, Golf Wang<br/>

You Nigerian fuck, now I'm stuck with this shitty facial hair<br/>
Also stuck with a beautiful home with a case stairs<br/>

Supposed to be gone until November but quickly came back in August<br/>

And, if I got stranded had to man up and hold my nuts<br/>
And hope that I could live off salt water and fucking coconuts<br/>
Phone ain't got no service this 3G is fucking worthless<br/>

Made a couple thousands turds spitting written verbs,<br/>
Shit, now I kick it in the 'burbs<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]</i><br/>
Me? I'm from the slums, niggas who pushing tons<br/>
Tons of drugs, Foul flow dirty mouth like kissing bums<br/>
Momma done made her one, a witty son<br/>
With no respect for women so-so, show me your titties hun<br/>
""You eighteen?"", Me? I'm twenty something<br/>
Okay I'm twenty, but I'm soon to be twenty-one<br/>
I wild out at shows, break shit it should be fun<br/>
Venues are like pussy with me, ""Should he cum?""<br/>
I'mma wax that like the chapstick in my backpack, for my black lips<br/>
Then dip to Europe and come back with a stack of cheese<br/>
A stack of cheese for these rats, Mac and Cheese<br/>
New Preme shit got me feeling flyer than a bag of bees<br/>
Fuck critics, (How's your dick?), ""Shit, How's your knees?""<br/>
Y'all on my dick more than my index when I take a pee<br/>
Came up with ""Rella"", ain't touch a bag of weed<br/>
Shit was doper than, Whitney Houston's needs<br/>
Golf Wang, that's the team to be, ""Aye!"", getting TU, OF NB<br/>
We was missing Sweatshirt like, where's the hooded sleeve<br/>
Okay, nevermind, we found him<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]</i><br/>
Guess I win, checks started cashing in,<br/>
I stopped rapping and started asking ""Where my fucking passion is?"",<br/>
Probably where that faggot went (Who?), Tyler talking father problems,<br/>
Shocky shit he spit to popping topics in a gossip column,<br/>
I ain't ask for this, I did it out of boredom,<br/>
Thought that roach was cool, he died and pushed me into stardom,<br/>
Now Ye's PJ sippin leche, Chips Ahoy! boy, listening to Cowboy,<br/>
Aye boy, land in Melbourne and skate to Fitzroy (Aye!),<br/>
AUS was AWES, I enjoyed, boy, y'all niggas played as a tot's toy,<br/>
Have a good day as I annoy, oi.<br/>

<i>[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]</i><br/>
Cameras with panorama's views<br/>
My shoes have seen more vans than Mexicanas with crackers in Alabama<br/>
G-O-to the-L-F, this O-F, I open a store so I don't stress<br/>
But nigga I, (What?), mosh in gardens, jazz punk shit<br/>
Playing chords, making up shit, pardon my Dolly Parton's<br/>
And I keep sharting, hoodies with rectangles and different colors<br/>
Niggers think I started kindergarten<br/>

(I just wanna ride my bike)<br/>

Hair blowing in the wind<br/>
Her freckles look like candy bars<br/>
Hair blowing in the wind<br/>

<i>[Intro: Nas]</i><br/>
Crack fucked up the world, and I wonder if they realized the damage<br/>
I mean, I come from an era who made a lot of money of that shit<br/>
I wonder if it fucked with their conscious<br/>
It fucked with me being out there, I couldn't stand it<br/>
I couldn't stand seeing people fucking themselves up like that<br/>
But that's where the money came from<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2: Tyler The Creator &amp; Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
48, 48, 48 states I get it in<br/>
48, 48, 48 states I get it in<br/>
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose<br/>
If you really need some blow<br/>
I can get it for the low<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]</i><br/>
Shit is getting warmer on that corner<br/>
Gotta watch out for them 5-0 phoners<br/>
Your mother is a goner<br/>
I warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar<br/>
You got a daughter, shits getting harder<br/>
The only thing you wanna bump her was your freedom<br/>
You can't afford to get caught up but you in too deep, and the seashore ain't soil<br/>
You got a mother, she don't support you<br/>
But you bought her a new house cause you love her<br/>
Growing up you barely had a roof<br/>
Now you got a coupe and it doesn't have a roof<br/>
I guess you’re accustomed to what you’re used to<br/>
So you bought two, nigga<br/>
They are coming for you, nigga<br/>
Niggas be hating I'm doing them bitches<br/>
Like Susan and Karen be doing your pockets<br/>
And running the man and he's losing his fucking mind and it’s all an illusion<br/>
Who was alludin' all of this potent<br/>
I am the reason your family is using and shootin' up, it’s my fault,<br/>
You can blame me motherfucker, for killin' your aunties and uncles,<br/>
The hustle and hunger, all I wanted was a cheeseburger,<br/>
And a little chain tuck, didn’t realize this game fucked, up some lives<br/>
“Oh how’s ma?” my conscience eats it up all the time<br/>
But other than that I’m fine I got a little money in my pocket.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]</i><br/>
Nigga, we broke as fuck<br/>
Homie got a chop shop I sold that truck<br/>
And I sold that dope<br/>
Motherfuckers hope this nigga go broke<br/>
But like my work I give no fucks, I’m sorry<br/>
She could have been a doctor, nigga, I’m sorry<br/>
Could have been a actor and won that Oscar, said, I'm sorry<br/>
I sold that soap and I killed black folk, I’m sorry<br/>
But I got a nice car, put my sister through school<br/>
While my momma all cool, I'm sorry<br/>
I'm in too deep and I can’t see the shore, I'm sorry<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Nas]</i><br/>
You get addicted to the flip, the transaction, the hustling<br/>
Even more than the money, it's just your job<br/>
You feel like it's your duty to be the man in between the man<br/>
And make this happen for that person, to do this and do that<br/>
You become the go to guy forever<br/>
And next thing you know you’re in too deep, way too deep<br/>
Scare the shit out of you, you wind up with so much work<br/>
That you'll be scared to death<br/>
It's important for us to realize, man<br/>
We gotta get out of that, man<br/>
Ya know, dudes is buying choppers<br/>
To shoot down people that look just like them<br/>
Dudes is buying guns to take down each other<br/>
Nobody wins<br/>
Ya known what I mean?

Went to Six Flags<br/>
Six fags came up and said, ""Ayo! Can we get a pic?"" I said, ""No.""<br/>
And they said, ""Oh, it's Wolf Gang, Yonkers. Goblin is my shit though.""<br/>
Now I'm like, ""Fuck! I don't wanna be an asshole!""<br/>
So I'm sitting there posing with Travis, Devon<br/>
With a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on<br/>
<br/>
So fuckin' annoyed 'cause I missed Goliath<br/>
'Cause some kid said I was there and then they caused a riot (Tyler's here)<br/>
Now I'm surrounded by a 25 hound of fuckers tryna get a photo<br/>
All because they noticed the top with the box logo on 'em fucking ears, <br/>
guarantee they didn't even hear Bastard<br/>
<br/>
They bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo, <br/>
I'm going fucking loco<br/>
""Hey, Tyler, can I—?""<br/>
No, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro?<br/>
""But, Tyler, you're my hero. I used to get bullied<br/>
Until I heard Radicals, the last part got to me.<br/>
See, I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed<br/>
Now I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be<br/>
<br/>
My life is just like yours: no father<br/>
My momma must've forgot to stop with a popped condom<br/>
In school I was the one that was thinking outside boxes<br/>
So everybody in them would say that I got problems<br/>
<br/>
So when I heard you say it, I said it back like fuck 'em<br/>
You're an inspiration to niggas like me<br/>
Not the niggas who just like you 'cause of lyrics and beats<br/>
I'm talking 'bout the niggas who don't know where they're going to be<br/>
<br/>
I heard the song Bastard right in the moment of heat<br/>
Not in the summer, but of course I was holding a heat<br/>
Gun on the edge of my feet. I heard that first piano chord<br/>
And it drew me in like predators carrying treats<br/>
Then I said to myself, 'Fuck! Is he speaking to me?'<br/>
See me and you we go together like snare in a beat<br/>
<br/>
I mean snare and a kick drum, see my forearm<br/>
I carved OF on it this morning with a glass shard<br/>
On my green miniramp that I built in my backyard (that's weird)<br/>
That's hard, that scar from playing air guitar<br/>
When I see you play at the Roxy (uh)<br/>
<br/>
Tyler, I love you, wanna be just like you (alright)<br/>
I think about your face and I don't even fucking try to (no homo)<br/>
Wish I had a basement meant for me to hide you<br/>
We could play X-Box and listen to 'In Search Of...' and eat donuts<br/>
Over conversating about what church does<br/>
<br/>
Come up with weird-ass videos with roach bugs<br/>
I'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip<br/>
And Raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch<br/>
You should've took me instead (uh, that's weird)<br/>
<br/>
See, if you can't have her then he shouldn't either<br/>
And if I can't have you then she shouldn't either<br/>
No one should see you, but me in your t-shirt<br/>
I worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt (what the fuck?)<br/>
<br/>
Odd Future, Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, Flog Gnaw, free Earl mobbing<br/>
I know it seems like I'm just slobbing on your knob<br/>
But I'm just a fan and I am losing my fucking noggin (yeah you are)<br/>
I ain't got a job and I went out and bought Goblin about 5 times<br/>
'Cause (thanks for the support) I love you man (alright)<br/>
<br/>
I like tie-dyed tees <br/>
or just plain white tees, <br/>
I like pants that's cut<br/>
I like words like fuck, I got your pics on my wall<br/>
With the mouth cut out, now paper cuts on my balls<br/>
Because your dick's in my jaw (what the fuck?)<br/>
<br/>
And I hit you on twitter about 10 minutes a day<br/>
And now I'm bitter 'cause you don't even reply with a ""hey"" (sorry)<br/>
And my boys think I'm gay 'cause I play VCR<br/>
In my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors...""<br/>
<br/>
Alright my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic<br/>
So I can get on colossus, line is slow as molasses<br/>
(Tyler listen) <br/>
no, nigga, I see you're loving my shit<br/>
And I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick<br/>
<br/>
But I'm not gay so it's awkward, now I'm grouchy like Oscar<br/>
After spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige dockers<br/>
Yonkers and Yonkers <br/>
(I love that song)<br/>
Sick of hearing about Yonkers<br/>
I'm grateful that it worked, I attacked and I conquered<br/>
<br/>
""Yeah whatever but I had a fucking blast at that concert<br/>
I was at the Boston one, I got a t-shirt from Sagan<br/>
the one that say ""Sagan Lockhart""<br/>
And when you came out to Sandwiches<br/>
That's when my fucking boy crush got started.""<br/>
<br/>
Just take this fucking picture, man. Shit.

Mother fuckers getting lynched and burned<br/>
I earned it, my flog gnaw badge is looking good<br/>
On this brand new jacket<br/>
The donuts on the flag waving over the cabin<br/>
Now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here<br/>
Hurry, quickly I need a piece of Hersheys<br/>
Darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking<br/>
I centered the mellow over the graham<br/>
Heated it too long now it's melting over my hand<br/>
Fuck it, I'll bite it, I burnt it, but I liked it<br/>

I never would've thought that<br/>
Feelings could get thrown in the air<br/>
Cause I accidentally caught that<br/>
I need some new boxing gloves, shit got hectic whenever I fought back<br/>
For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts<br/>
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty four times<br/>
I think about you or something like that<br/>
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else<br/>
I don't like that; cellular convos getting left in the wrong<br/>
Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back<br/>
This isn't a song, I just happen to rhyme when I get emo<br/>
And find time to write facts (fuck)<br/>

Crazy who makes me the happiest<br/>
Can make me the saddest<br/>
Look Alice<br/>
Let's get lost in your wonder-er-land fuck an atlas<br/>
You're perfectly perfect for me<br/>
What the fuck is this, practice?<br/>
Actually, if you even consider leaving<br/>
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathing<br/>
And you'll see the meaning of stalking<br/>
When I pop out the dark to find you<br/>
And that new dude that you're seeing with an attitude<br/>
Then proceed to fuck up your evening<br/>
Make sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans<br/>
Cause when I hear your name I can not stop cheesing<br/>
I love you so much that my heart stops beating when you're leaving<br/>
And I'm grieving and my heart starts bleeding<br/>
Life without you has no goddamn meaning<br/>
Sorry -- I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason<br/>
It's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons<br/>
I'll fall for you, but I love you<br/>

Music had nothing to do with my final decision<br/>
I just really wanted somebody to come pay me attention<br/>
But nobody would listen, but stuffed animals that I had<br/>
Since I was a kid but I'm growing up so they missin'<br/>
I didn't mean to hurt anybody I'm sorry<br/>
I wouldn't hurt a fly or consider joining the army<br/>
I'm hardly ever angry, roger rabbit framed me<br/>
Momma I'm the same fucking kid that you made see?<br/>
I don't wanna go to jail I just wanna go home<br/>
And I want those fucking kids at school to just leave me alone<br/>
And I... I hear helicopters make them dip<br/>
I'm fucking reloaded I told you all that I ain't takin' shit<br/>
You better backup before this mac starts to lift up<br/>

I had a decline in the buzz, not a shocker bruh, I had the stun gun in my bum,<br/>
And when I drop shit you better have a towel and a sponge,<br/>
And ask why bitch, I eat a ton bucket of chum,<br/>
In Bikini Bottom, I am the biggest problem,<br/>
This shit fishy niggas dip like we were set in Harlem,<br/>
Eaters turn them into nuggets like Carmelo Anthon(y),<br/>
We just sit and burn shit just like my fucking anthem<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Mike G]</i><br/>
I'm like goals, those is something you have to stand to reach,<br/>
My campaign speech elect me, Commander in Chief,<br/>
Respect to me is ever minor, appearances cause mass hysteria,<br/>
But I'm still uncomparable, I'm like the face of America,<br/>
I'm the ambassador from a land made of gold,<br/>
I'm a fuckin' centerfold, I'm somethin' to behold,<br/>
I can kill a hundred shows, take on for the road,<br/>
I'm results of putting persistent pressure on coals<br/>

Golf is the bedsheets, (Hat and my T-shirt),<br/>

I'm real with the box, and I murder with the pen,<br/>

All I ever told you to do was grow up, don't grow down<br/>
You know, like, you know, grow up<br/>
Don't grow down, grow out<br/>
You go from being a kid, doing your thing, hanging out with your friends<br/>
Months later you're world famous<br/>
You're a gay rights activist, and you don't even know it<br/>
You know what, I don't wanna say it to you no more, Tyler<br/>

Nothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'mma punch you, nigga<br/>
Never made of plastic, I'm a savage, you look lunch my nigga<br/>
Passing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga<br/>
We ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no mollies, bitch<br/>
I'm hockin', spitting got some niggas out here poppin' ollie switch<br/>
Buncha novices, Odd Future the squad, is thick<br/>
Them young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense<br/>
We the last of a dying breed<br/>
And we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs<br/>
You stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please<br/>
My pocket's solid, making profit off the highest tees<br/>
Bitch, merch twerk as I get on the verse, cursin'<br/>
Nigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person<br/>
Watch me get this money, I'm up when the bird's chirpin'<br/>
Make actions, fuck rehearsing<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]</i><br/>
In a world where kids my age are popping mollies with leather<br/>
Sitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather<br/>
Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether<br/>
Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better<br/>
I was a drama club kid, I run where the fun did, my nuts itched<br/>
I was defiant, always said, ""Fuck shit""<br/>
Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one<br/>
Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some<br/>
See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's<br/>
And I be gassin' up my buzz like some bees at a Shell<br/>
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele<br/>
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some braille<br/>
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well<br/>
I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself<br/>
These fucking rappers got stylist, it's cause they can't think for themselves<br/>
See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but<br/>
Really, boy? Posers looking silly boy<br/>
I'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi<br/>
Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is (Diddy Riese)<br/>
Na'kel Smith. Transworld page 64<br/>
Poppin' like oil, ollies, and fire flames<br/>
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game<br/>
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name<br/>
I'm 'bout as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes<br/>
But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists<br/>
God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished<br/>
And my shit's missing, he hates women, but loves kittens<br/>
See y'all niggas trippin' man<br/>
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong<br/>
Saying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs<br/>
Look at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me<br/>
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat<br/>
Look at the kid who had the 9 and tried to blow out his mind<br/>
But talk is money, I said, ""Hi,"" I guess I bought him some time<br/>
Look at the ones in the crowd. That shit is barnacles, huh?<br/>
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?<br/>
But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan<br/>
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements<br/>
And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing<br/>
Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for their fucking ratings<br/>
""Analog"" fans are getting sick of the rape<br/>
All the ""Tron Cat"" fans are getting sick of the lakes<br/>
But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints<br/>
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank<br/>
Over and over, shit, who gives a fuck what I think?<br/>
My fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct<br/>
Fuck buying studio time. I'mma go purchase a shrink<br/>
Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch<br/>

<i>[Hook]</i><br/>

<i>[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering<br/>
So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me<br/>
But Momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump you fucking pussy?)<br/>
All I'm seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me<br/>
That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff<br/>
Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot)<br/>
Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids<br/>
So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)<br/>
Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and<br/>
All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol, I got one!)<br/>
Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs<br/>
Brother the Pigeons is us<br/>
Bid you goodnight and good luck<br/>

I started off with disposables now I have an assortment<br/>
And I'm using these negatives to develop a portrait<br/>
Now the frame is a pain in the ass to get it in<br/>
Without a scratch or stain on the glass<br/>
But that's not important, just as long as it's printed<br/>

But when I got the news, yup it left your boy stuck<br/>
Cause when my mom dipped out she was the one that gave me a fuck<br/>
Mom callin' and callin', I'm on my way to a show<br/>
I answer, she cryin' sayin' Sadie is dyin'<br/>
The doc said she only had a week for us to speak<br/>
Before she deceased, cause cancer was just eating her cheeks up<br/>
Fuck, nah this is really awkward for me bruh<br/>
I hang the phone up, and adjust my seat back<br/>
And started to think, like ""What the fuck just happened?""<br/>
I never had a death and I just seen her a week ago<br/>
Meet them at the hospital I should<br/>
In between the set of BADBADNOTGOOD<br/>
Lionel asked what happened I said it's bad bad, not good<br/>
Just take me to the Cedars-Sinai off of Oakwood<br/>
Gettin' there, family sittin' center chair<br/>
Awkard in the lobby, it was floating in the thinning air<br/>
Getting there, need a sticker saying how I got in there, there's a room<br/>
Open up the curtain, she's just sitting there, hello<br/>
Our conversations brief, couldn't even make eye contact when we speak<br/>
Lookin' at her you could tell all she had was weak<br/>
And I'm not talkin' days bruh, I'm talkin' 'bout her strife<br/>
I sat there 20 minutes tops, hopin' it was just a fuckin' plea that she could cop<br/>
She died that night<br/>

And you will never catch me in none of their fucking shin-digs<br/>
I hope you fucking niggas is angry, pissed, and offended<br/>
In Search of... did more for me than Illmatic<br/>
That's when I realized we ain't cut from the same fabric<br/>
I made my own shit, you went out and bought yours<br/>
Man I got too much drive, motherfucker, I hate traffic<br/>
La-di-da-di, I'm going harder than coming out the closet to conservative Christian fathers<br/>
When it's a lot at stake carne asada let's be honest, I'm really morphing<br/>
Named the album Cherry Bomber cause Greatest Hits sounded boring<br/>
<br/>
I don't like to follow the rules, she said that I must<br/>
I don't have any armpits<br/>
She wanted to talk who's in charge of this Golf shit<br/>
I said ""Howdy do? How are you? I'm the sergeant""<br/>
And who I are isn't really important<br/>
My heart is as dark as a window with car tint<br/>
So hop in with your friends, yellin' out ""unpark it""<br/>
And I'll do donuts until the fat one is carsick<br/>
It's young T<br/>
<br/>
I don't like to follow the rules<br/>
And that's just who I am<br/>
I hope you understand<br/>
<br/>
And I don't really think y'all cool<br/>
So give yourself a hand<br/>
No, no, give yourself a hand<br/>
<br/>
Better pose for that camera<br/>
Better pose, boy you better pose<br/>
And it's your life nigga I suppose<br/>
For the lights, for the camera, and the action<br/>
<br/>
Now you're face is meltin' from the flash of the big ol' lights<br/>
Nigga you ask for this life<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to death camp<br/>
Yeah, welcome to death camp<br/>
Yeah, welcome to death camp<br/>
<br/>
Kissing on my bean bag<br/>
Your lips half on my tongue<br/>
Moonwalk through your hair<br/>
(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)<br/>
This is fun I can tell<br/>
I don't know if you'll handle it well<br/>
Welcome to hell camp<br/>

You should be mine in a way tonight<br/>

God, goodness gracious<br/>
I can't wait to see the look on y'all niggas faces<br/>
That boy T not surprised his thoughts and chasten<br/>
Fuck them crackers up at Mountain Dew them niggas is racist<br/>
Cabbage was made, critic faggots was shook<br/>
So I told 'em that I'll exchange the word faggot with book<br/>
And all them books is pissed off and at they page in a bunch<br/>
Fuckin' attitude switch is like a book with a strife<br/>
But, I'm a fraud I pray to God when it's six triple book bashin' while<br/>
Me and my favorite archive lips tickle<br/>
Peter Parker pickle pack of peppers when the plot thickens<br/>
Tyler, The Creator fuckin' kill you with a popsicle<br/>
Cold blooded so we rock mittens so they won't find him<br/>
Not kiddin' keep the Tommy on me bitch, I'm Ms.Pickles<br/>
Said I seem off, last time that team talked<br/>
Sick of making niggas cabbage so I took the 'preme off<br/>
Should've bought some stock in it (Yo it's fucked up, I get it. <br/>
It's shocking as fuck! They ain't get it)<br/>
Not Golf when the little homies don't, wait<br/>
Lets weigh my options<br/>
I bought me a mansion, That bought some attention<br/>
Give none to Hopsin<br/>
And dear Boyce Watkins<br/>
Why you mad, it's the slave in me<br/>
It's Facts boy i'm back like Rosa Parks in their favorite seat<br/>
Videos, stage dives, popups, they watching T'<br/>
While y'all niggas watchin' the throne, the throne be watching me<br/>
<br/>
If you fuck this up<br/>
There are so many fuckin' kids right now, listenin' to this guy<br/>
Get those wings flapping motherfucker!<br/>
Cause this kid's ready to fucking fly<br/>
<br/>
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo, nigger nigger on the wall<br/>
Rap bars, jail bars, guys shootin' basketballs<br/>

Cops know who I was cause kids said the show was AWEsome<br/>
<br/>
Tyler, Tyler, I swear to, I swear to fuck! If you fucking...<br/>
Do NOT fuck this up!<br/>
You have the whole world in your fucking hands<br/>
<br/>
How many leaders in the house?<br/>
Well can't somebody bring the mirrors out, I'm getting lonely<br/>
Likes and apologies, the snaps make it obvious<br/>
That everybody on this fucking planet lackin' confidence<br/>
How many leaders in the house? (Do not fuck this up!)<br/>
Well can't somebody bring the camera out so I can film me<br/>
See a great director nigga's vision must be blurry<br/>
Boy I give them epic shots like jaywalkin' in Missouri<br/>
Wait...<br/>
How many leaders in the house?<br/>
Well can't somebody bring my album out so I can hear one<br/>
Pour me a drink, shit I don't know what to think<br/>

Wait...<br/>
How many leaders in the house?<br/>
See why nobody got they hands up, see that's the issue

On a scale from nine to ten<br/>
You taking L's baby, <br/>
Hold my hand and feel the wind, uh<br/>
Now fasten your seatbelt and turn everything off<br/>
I got your attention, muthafucka I'm bout to take off<br/>
I'm the new pilot in this bitch<br/>
And I ain't bring no extra baggage for this trip<br/>
But I do bring a terror like I hate America<br/>
Brand new camera and a parachute<br/>
Nigga you ain't high enough to save me<br/>
Don't talk to me til I fuckin' embarrass you<br/>
Now sit your ass down you do it three much<br/>
I'm the captain on this bitch, don't get it fucked up<br/>
Or you'll get fucked up<br/>

I'm so far ahead you niggas I'm in the future<br/>
Y'all don't even know about my existence, it's like I'm dead to you<br/>
You niggas know what I'm sayin'<br/>
Look, y'all be on the stupid shit<br/>
I'm the fuckin' pilot, your role is to be the stewardess<br/>
I'm the fuckin' bomb like I would stuff my shoe in it<br/>
If anything happens it's one door<br/>
If I see a building, motherfucker we're done for<br/>
I'mma hit a couple of 'em up cause it's Parkour<br/>
Then I call your family and get your last wishes, nigga<br/>
And every line dirty, you thought that I dug ditches<br/>
But I never give a fuck, it's like I was born dickless<br/>

I don't wanna crash anymore, I don't wanna crash anymore<br/>
I just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face<br/>
Til there's nothing left in the gas tank<br/>
I don't wanna crash, I don't wanna crash anymore<br/>
I don't wanna crash anymore<br/>
I just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face<br/>
Til there's nothing left in the gas tank<br/>

Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach<br/>
Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach<br/>
<br/>
I'm tryna find a place, a place where I can land at<br/>
A place where I can be<br/>
With no alphabet dictatin' where to stand at<br/>
You could buy a car, you could buy many things<br/>
You could buy happiness but you can't buy wings<br/>
You could buy a parachute, you could buy a parrot<br/>
But you can't buy a pair of wings that will dynamic<br/>
Stay cloud level<br/>

You see my shit isn't stock<br/>
I used to piss in a pot and now I piss on the walls<br/>
Since I pissed off a cop, a couple tickets I have copped<br/>
But I can pay for them all<br/>
And by the model of my vehicle you know that I ball<br/>
A 92 but 91 the year that Tyler was spawned<br/>
And If I crash in the woods then I'ma follow with this<br/>
Like I'm tryna get stick or automatic you pick<br/>
Shit is static as shit, sure my shit is a M<br/>
Might get that X6 end don't follow exit him<br/>
Might take back street hidden<br/>
House got all sports cars like his garage is gym<br/>
Two sapphires on your neck thats his precious gems<br/>

Boy I'm just rhyming these syllables, suck my genitals<br/>
Album cover looking like the mask of the timberwolves<br/>

Hoping that I ditched the chords and go pick up the pen again<br/>
Cause I kill the dark shit like I'm motherfucking Zimmerman<br/>
Turn around and lose pounds like I'm fucking Timbaland<br/>
By pounds, I mean in(beep)<br/>
Give it till he cop brick like a wall with pig in it<br/>
And money coming out the blue<br/>
Like cops are changing fits or shit I'm killin' it<br/>

Back when left brain had the hightop fade<br/>

<i>[FUCKING YOUNG]</i><br/>
<br/>
The day that I met you girl<br/>
I knew that it was something special<br/>
But I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck I can't sing whatever look)<br/>
We met through mutual friends<br/>
And this is where the story and confusion begin<br/>
Cause I was in a problem but I had to pretend that I wasn't<br/>
<br/>
There go the police man knocking at my door<br/>
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat<br/>
Or do I answer real confused like ""I don't know""<br/>
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more<br/>
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored<br/>
There's nobody at the door, man I'm so paranoid<br/>
<br/>
Girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young for me<br/>
And when temptation calls, I never pick up<br/>
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young<br/>
This is more than a crush, I just might be in love<br/>
<br/>
A six year difference<br/>
Is a ten year sentence<br/>
And with the pigment on my skin, I don't want to be another statistic<br/>
You bring me joy, joy, joy, joy<br/>
And you fill a void that was once missing<br/>
And I can say I'm in love<br/>
<br/>
There go the police man knocking at my door<br/>
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat<br/>
Or do I answer real confused like ""I don't know""<br/>
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more<br/>
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored<br/>
There's nobody at the door, man I'm so paranoid<br/>
<br/>
Girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young for me<br/>
And when temptation calls, I never pick up<br/>
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young<br/>
This is more than a crush, I just might be in love<br/>
<br/>
When you're 35, I'll be 41<br/>
And when I'm 27, you'll be 21<br/>
Yo, this is dumb<br/>
And when that time comes for that 1-8, I'll probably run<br/>
Cause I'm fucking terrified, yo this is dumb<br/>
You should find someone else<br/>
I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself<br/>
And mentally you're older than me and that shit doesn't help<br/>
Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help<br/>
So when you mention ""hang,"" I'm thinking about a tree and a belt<br/>
And I don't want no relation, shit no relation<br/>
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention<br/>
Span, it's gonna suck your shit<br/>
Hits that kitchen fan<br/>
It splattered on me like my dick in my hand<br/>
What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off<br/>
Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off<br/>
She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught<br/>
That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds<br/>
But I found my wings, fuck<br/>
(But you're too fucking young)<br/>
I really like you<br/>
(And when temptation calls, I never pick up<br/>
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young)<br/>
Funny thing about this is<br/>
By the time you hear this, I'll be in the clear<br/>
It's T and Uncle Charlie<br/>
(But you're too young, but you're too young, but you're too young)<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Kali Uchis:]</i><br/>
Boy I know that we could be more than just friends<br/>
But you're scared<br/>
Boy I know<br/>
That we could be more than just friends<br/>
But you're scared<br/>
I know<br/>
I know that there could be<br/>
Somethin' for you and me<br/>
What's your philosophy?<br/>
You're scared, scared<br/>
And I exit and wait a while<br/>
(Just say the word)<br/>
See the answers are all there<br/>
(But I'm just too blind to see)<br/>
You and I are cut from different fabric<br/>
(I wonder why, I wonder why girl)<br/>
Don't be too material to see<br/>
(But I'm just too blind to see)<br/>
This world is such a struggle just to be<br/>
Fuck 'em all baby it's just you and me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tyler:]</i><br/>
But you're too fuckin' young<br/>
And girl I know that you're the one for me<br/>
And it hurts<br/>
It fuckin hurts<br/>
Fuck<br/>
Cause you're too fuckin' young<br/>
And girl I know that you're the one for me<br/>
And it hurts<br/>
It fuckin' hurts<br/>
Cause you're too fuckin' young<br/>
And girl I know that you're the one<br/>
That you're the one<br/>
For me<br/>
Cause you're too fuckin young<br/>
And girl I know that you're the one for me<br/>
Yeah<br/>

For your boy<br/>
I'm watchin' Freaks and Geeks<br/>
With the trampoline on the floor<br/>
I'm tryna' cop the new McLaren<br/>
With the vertical doors, nigga<br/>
<br/>
Money, money, money, money<br/>
Money ain't the motive<br/>
What's your name again? Nobody knows it<br/>
Don't speak to me nigga, you not impo'tant<br/>
I'm focused (2, 3, 4)<br/>
Bring in the horns<br/>
They say I'm nutty, I'm picnic basket<br/>
I'm short of a sandwich, I'm peanut butter<br/>
Boyce Watkin's a faggot, please come and get me<br/>
Said I suck him at your neck like a hickey, boy, I'm sicky<br/>
Like a HIV victim, ain't nobody fuckin' wit me<br/>
I got banned from New Zealand, Whitey called me a demon<br/>
And a terrorist, goddammit, I couldn't believe in it<br/>
Ban a kid from a country, I never fall, never timber<br/>
But you fucked up as a parent, your child idol's a nigga<br/>
I clearly don't give a fuck so you could run that shit back<br/>
And fuck your loud pack and fuck your Snapchat<br/>
Cherry Bomb<br/>
The greatest fuckin' album since the days of sound<br/>
And that shit gon' pop<br/>
Just like that nigga that was never 'round<br/>
Damn, bout to drop, gas 'em up, thick exhaust<br/>
Young T, came quick, hard to beat, dick is soft<br/>
We ain't lyin', we the truth, call him Simba, beats his hooves<br/>
Tyler, The Creator sweatin' Jesus juice<br/>
Put that fuckin' cow on my level, 'cause I'm raisin' the stakes<br/>
Mom, I made you a promise, it's no more section 8<br/>
When we ate its the steaks, now our section is great<br/>
'Cause that's the level I'm at, my niggas pass 'em a plate<br/>
'Ye!<br/>

Why, oh why, why, why don't they like me?<br/>
Cause Nike gave a lot of niggas checks<br/>
But I'm the only nigga to ever check Nike<br/>
<br/>
Richer than white people with black kids<br/>
Scarier than black people with ideas<br/>
Nobody can tell me where I'm headin'<br/>
But I feel like Michael Jordan<br/>
Scottie Pippen at my weddin'<br/>
They say I'm crazy, but that's the best thing goin' for me<br/>
You can't Lynch Marshawn if Tom Brady throwin' to me<br/>
I made a million mistakes, but I'm successful in spite of 'em<br/>
I believe you like a fat trainer takin a bite or somethin'<br/>
I wanna turn the tanks to playgrounds<br/>
I dreamt of 2Pac, he asked me ""Are you still down?""<br/>
Yeah, my nigga, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on<br/>
I know they tell they white daughters<br/>
""Don't bring home Jerome""<br/>
I am the free nigga archetype<br/>
I am the light and the beacon<br/>
You can ask the deacon<br/>
It's funny, when you get extra money<br/>
Every joke you tell just be extra funny<br/>
I mean, you can even dress extra bummy<br/>
Cocaine, bathroom break, nose extra runny<br/>
And I gave you all I got, you still want extra from me<br/>
Oxford want a full-blown lecture from me<br/>
And the Lexus pull up, errr, like hop, I hopped out, like wassup?<br/>
Err-err-err, step back, hold up, my nigga, you suck, hold up<br/>
I studied the proportions<br/>
Emotions runnin' at a Autobahn speed-level<br/>
Had a drink with Fear, and I was textin' God<br/>
He said, ""I gave you a big dick, so go extra hard""<br/>
<br/>

And a couple trees, where the money grow<br/>
And get bodies burnin<br/>

Tell these black kids they can be who they are<br/>
Dye your hair blue, shit, I'll do it too<br/>
Look, I smell like Chanel<br/>
I never mall gup with my manicured nails<br/>
I coconut oil the skin<br/>

Took a little while, nigga making leaves<br/>
Keep it in my branches family could eat<br/>
Favorite color green, energy is strong<br/>
Giving niggas life, birdies and the beez<br/>
Dropping them seeds, not what you want<br/>

My mother warned me that some niggas ain't my right hand<br/>
To trust her, only my heart and that elder white man<br/>
His name is Clancy, I fancy him, gotta give him props<br/>
He half the reason why dealerships even let me cop<br/>
So now I'm speedin' and tryna drive away from the fact<br/>
That she was right, so I triple left, tryna double back<br/>
The streets are filled with some clues, like how I ain't notice that?<br/>
(How I ain't see that?) Fuck it, I seen some familiar stuff in the cul-de-sac<br/>
I pull up, get out, what up? I wanna help<br/>
But what you want for some, some niggas really don't want for themself<br/>
Now do I stay? Do I go? That's my dilemma<br/>
And traffic is picking up, if I don't leave I'ma get stuck (skrrt)<br/>
So I speed off, we talk barely and it seems awk..<br/>
-Ward, and I heard through some words that you off it<br/>
I got too much drive, don't wanna steer off path<br/>
And crash and get distracted<br/>
But I listen to that weather man 'cause it might rain<br/>
Keep my windshield wipers prepared 'cause y'all threw so much shade<br/>
And I got jacket in trunk, but that's in the front<br/>
I also got power for both of us if you're ever in need of jump<br/>
Just let me know, my nigga<br/>

<i>[Jaden Smith &amp; Tyler, The Creator:]</i><br/>

Fishtail in the rearview mir' on 'em (skrrrrrt!)<br/>
I had to switch the gears on 'em<br/>
You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em<br/>
Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole<br/>
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole<br/>

So I be prepared for their bites, they're all talk<br/>
I left the condom in the grass so fuck off<br/>
Watchin' Clarence in a mansion with nobody in it<br/>
Young successful nigga, ride McLaren with no windows tinted<br/>
I draw my piggies when I'm in it 'cause it feels amazin'<br/>
The irony is I stopped eatin' bacon<br/>
Don't get it twisted, nigga, I'm still hungry, oh he lonely<br/>
All my friends talk about their hoes and tenderonies<br/>
All I can show 'em is a couple cars and more things<br/>
That I've made in the couple past month, he's on, please<br/>
Everyone is a sheep, me, a lone wolf<br/>
Nobody gon' make a peep 'cause everyone wants some wool<br/>
Since everyone is a sheep, not everyone here is cool<br/>
Man I'd rather drown in a pool by myself than fuck with their fleece<br/>
See, man, T-Man fans be seesaw<br/>
Wind blows, they go, which way, who knows?<br/>
One day, ""Fuck no,"" the next day, ""Okay""<br/>
But fuck y'all, I know that T is four for four<br/>
I just want that garden and that Batmobile<br/>
Good health, success, time on earth worthwhile<br/>
Find somebody who love me and raise a couple of lizards<br/>
But my vehicle's good for now, that's in a couple of miles<br/>
Now keep it pushin', nigga<br/>

And they ain't wanna walk<br/>

Thought it'd be like the phrase ""poof,"" gone<br/>
But, it's still goin' on<br/>
Big fan of the base 10<br/>
Polka dot knows, how it goes<br/>
Had to keep it on the subwoofer<br/>
A couple butterflies when I float<br/>
I was always like eh<br/>
Barely interested, but I bag just to brag to my boys like bruh<br/>
This is a crucial subject matter<br/>
Sensitive like cookin' batter<br/>
'Til the temperature that's risin'<br/>

Attention seeker, public speaker<br/>
Oh my God, that boy is so fuckin' lonely<br/>
Writin' songs about these people<br/>
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony<br/>
One thing I know, is that I wanna<br/>
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago<br/>
Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low<br/>
You can't lift me up, I'm like a 'Lardo<br/>
From the start it's been real dark<br/>
It's been so dark I guess that you could call it charbroiled, huh<br/>
I'm playin' like Hasbro<br/>
I'm really sorry, call me auto<br/>
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla<br/>
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)<br/>
But what the fuck else do you want from me?<br/>
That is the only thing keepin' me company<br/>
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed<br/>
These items is fillin' the void<br/>
Been feelin' it for so long<br/>
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (oh)<br/>
Goin' backdoors and at door<br/>
My partner is a chateau<br/>
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?<br/>
Fuck it, I can find some tomorrow<br/>
Woah, but that never comes<br/>
Like a vasectomy, what have I done?<br/>
I got the talent, the face and the funds<br/>
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)<br/>
Mirror, mirror on the wall (who)<br/>
The loneliest of them all (me)<br/>
Cupid actin' stupid<br/>
Do you got another number I could call?<br/>
Never had a pet<br/>
I've never had a pet<br/>
There's more fish in the sea<br/>
But I never had a goldfish to begin with<br/>
I never had a dog<br/>
So I've never been good with bitches<br/>
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch<br/>
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet<br/>
Treat me like direct deposit<br/>
Check in on me sometime<br/>
Ask me how I'm really doin'<br/>
So I never have to press that 911<br/>

Oh! Damn! Damn!

I consider my heart rate has slowed down at the ending<br/>
Cause the love I got for you has exceeded appearance, the lyrics<br/>
Matter of fact, I'mma just call you, so you can hear it<br/>
If you do answer, I play it to state facts<br/>
Although I already know the response you gon' say back<br/>
At that point I'll hang up, disappear and just stay back<br/>
And if you don't I'll leave a voicemail with the playback<br/>

Stop lyin' to yourself, I know the real you<br/>
Halloween ain't for a minute, lose the costume<br/>
You need to chill, OK<br/>
Been running from the targets and them back in the day<br/>
And now they workin' their all, now the track on the DAW<br/>
Actin' the fool, actin' up, or are we packin' the park<br/>

But I'm still running out of time, (Out of time)<br/>
Running out of time (Of time)<br/>
Still running out of (Of time)<br/>

I saw a photo, you looked joyous<br/>
My eyes are green, I eat my veggies<br/>
I need to get her out the picture<br/>
She's really fuckin' up my frame<br/>

My buddy said I'm on the spectrum<br/>
Don't call me selfish, I hate sharing<br/>
This 60/40 isn't working, I want 100 of your time, you're mine<br/>
Please don't leave me now, please don't leave me now (Don't leave)<br/>
Please don't leave me now, please don't leave me now (Don't leave)<br/>

You wanna get me mixin', there's no pot (Can make her bleed)<br/>
She's gonna be dead, I just got a magic wand<br/>
We can finally be together<br/>
<br/>
You roll the dice, hit a 7, sho' you right, beginner's luck<br/>
You not my first, who gives a fuck?<br/>
Your other one evaporate, we celebrate<br/>
You under oath, now pick a side, and if you don't<br/>
I pick you both, it's not a joke<br/>
Murder, she wrote<br/>
<br/>
Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear<br/>
I live life with no fear, except for the idea that one day you won't be here<br/>
I will not fetch the ball, eyes are green I eat my vegetables<br/>
It has nothing to do with that broad, but if it did, guarantee she'd be gone (Well)<br/>
I got a plan that could walk independent, he can't understand I'm a hawk in the gymt<br/>
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest, that I need to get off or I ain't talking to them<br/>
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame<br/>
Gon' let the world know, 'cause I ain't got no shame<br/>
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't<br/>
I want to share last names, I want to be your number one, not the other one<br/>
Keep it on the low, I'm in my right mind, keep it on the high<br/>
Jannis Joplin, spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em<br/>
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store<br/>
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door<br/>
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned<br/>

Ayo, I wanna talk<br/>
I wanna call you and talk, I wanna walk to your front door and knock<br/>
After I stop my vehicle, drive to your city 'cause we live an hour apart<br/>
Land at your driveway and put it in park<br/>
Then do the third line of this verse<br/>
Then back to my house and we pack up our bikes<br/>
And we ride through the park, chase the sun<br/>
That's all I want, other than air, other than air<br/>
I want your company, I need your company<br/>
I want you to want for me, I can't maneuver without you next to me<br/>
It's so complex to me<br/>

What do you need? Do you need bread?<br/>
Do you need this? Do you need a hug?<br/>
Do you need to be alone?<br/>

Where is Rudolph? You're parasitic<br/>
I do not have self control<br/>
I am starting to wonder, is this my free will or yours? (Yours, yours, yours)<br/>

I just get my Mike on<br/>
Y'all said I wouldn't go nowhere, I took the detour<br/>

If the cop says my name bitch, I'm Igor<br/>

Hard to believe in God when there ain't no mirrors around, what's up?<br/>

Bitch, runnin' til the rims fall<br/>
Had them niggas and the cops lookin' jigsaw<br/>

Green hair angels all around me<br/>
No answer why, no tears to cry, bitch I'm alive<br/>
That wasn't my endpoint like V-neck<br/>
I ain't have nobody to cheat on, I'm cheating death<br/>
New album no repeat, I reset<br/>
Everything I delivered swingin' like new jack<br/>
Two of them, I totaled Kim and Pam<br/>
Me and death, earthquake middle man<br/>
Quick nap, kick back like closed eyes shut loud sound no scratch<br/>
Motherfuckers really thought I died hoping they could take a spot<br/>
Nigga not knowing that I'm one of one and make some hella killer raps<br/>
Nigga and I got my eyes open now, I see the, light<br/>

Comparing scars before dinner<br/>
Jump off the roof into the mirror<br/>
Felt like summer<br/>
To my December<br/>
Was it my August?<br/>
Shit, I don't remember<br/>
(2, 3, go)<br/>
I know my temperature was sinking<br/>
You finally flew south<br/>
The bird gon' leave the nest<br/>
It's so comedic<br/>
At least I had it<br/>
Instead of never<br/>
Or maybe I'm too dramatic<br/>
<br/>
(2, 3, go)<br/>
Whether it's rain or shine<br/>
I know I'm fine for now<br/>
My love's gone<br/>
My love's gone<br/>
My love's gone<br/>
Gone, gone<br/>
<br/>
(2, 3, go)<br/>
Or maybe it's just a dream<br/>
That I can't seem to wake up from<br/>
My love's gone<br/>
My love's gone<br/>
My love's gone<br/>
Gone<br/>
<br/>
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone<br/>
<br/>
I know love is, is all I got<br/>
I just hope to God she got to taste<br/>
Could put you on some shit you never seen<br/>
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to<br/>
I hope you know she can't compete with me<br/>
<br/>
Whether it's rain or shine<br/>
I know I'm fine for now<br/>
My love's gone<br/>
My love's gone<br/>
My love's gone<br/>
Gone, gone<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe it's just a dream<br/>
That I can't seem to wake up from<br/>
My love's gone<br/>
My love's gone<br/>
My love's gone<br/>
Gone, gone, gone<br/>
<br/>
Keep going<br/>
The feeling is falling off now<br/>
Keep it going<br/>
The feeling is falling off now<br/>
Keep It going<br/>
The feeling is falling off now<br/>
Going<br/>
And now I'm scarred for life<br/>
<br/>
My love is gone, gone<br/>
My love is gone, gone<br/>
My love is gone (Is gone)<br/>
My love is gone<br/>
<br/>
Ayo<br/>
There's poison in that gumbo<br/>
Emotion for Dumbo<br/>
Ask me where my luck go<br/>
That bitch walked outside the front door<br/>
Knock, knock, knock, knock<br/>
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me<br/>
It's my fault you gon' leave<br/>
Let's not talk, see the<br/>
Weather man told me<br/>
It wasn't raining, my stupid ass brought umbrellas<br/>
I got a glimpse of your cloud, I feel better<br/>
Now it's 90 degrees and all the tricks up my sleeve<br/>
Is drenched in sweat and illusion because I jet to conclusion<br/>
You got your thing<br/>
I got nothing<br/>
But memories<br/>
I know your secrets, n****<br/>
I'm not bitter or nothin', I understand that<br/>
E'rrbody making a choice according to planning<br/>
We had two different blueprints<br/>
But understood her fluent<br/>
She opened up early on, I thought I had a permit<br/>
You started building a bridge and turned it into a fence<br/>
Then my building got tore down<br/>
Because of your need to net<br/>
I just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease<br/>
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it<br/>
But I finally found peace, so peace<br/>
<br/>
(Gone)<br/>
<br/>
Want me to do it over?<br/>
Everything<br/>
<br/>
I hate wasting potential<br/>
That shit crushes your spirit, it really does<br/>
It crushes your soul<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the love<br/>
Thank you for the joy<br/>
But I am never gonna fall in love again<br/>
Thank you for the time<br/>
Thank you for your mind, hon<br/>
But I'm never gonna fall love again<br/>
<br/>
(Got my eye)<br/>
I said, go<br/>
Go<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the love<br/>
Thank you for the joy<br/>
But I am never going to fall in love again<br/>

I might just add a verse for no reason, fuck it<br/>
Ayo<br/>
<br/>
I shit in my garden and play Stevie Wonder<br/>
And get foot massages while Clancy talk numbers<br/>
He threw me some game and I swear I won't fumble<br/>
Might cop me a Bronco to ride for the summer<br/>
Marni the trousers, tell Risso to holla<br/>
The carnival sell out, the stadium Dodger<br/>
I cut off some homies, but Taco my brodie<br/>
Until he score millions, I won't leave the goalie<br/>
Might pass 'em the mittens, he never betrayed me<br/>
The E30 sitting, the 675LT my daily<br/>
The engine is stupid, I drive like a tutor<br/>
When I move, it moves, the transmission like Luda<br/>
Now ketchup like packets, my new nigga pretty<br/>
Your new bitch is tacky like Busta Rhymes jackets<br/>
Want smoke? I can match it, the second-hand action<br/>
We exhale you inhale and asthma attack<br/>
Teeing off, niggas nauseous<br/>
As fuck, fuck you thought?<br/>
Bitch, it's GOLF<br/>

Never let a nigga tell me I couldn't stunt<br/>

Then go home and big cry 'cause their acne is real<br/>
Show them scars motherfucker<br/>
How you think they gon' heal up?<br/>
Scab ass niggas fucking up all the deals<br/>
I got niggas tryna slander me<br/>
That I knew from the start<br/>
But I can't do it back to them<br/>
It ain't no hate in my heart<br/>
Y'all Stephen Hawkings with the way that y'all make moves (rip)<br/>
But I'ma flip the channel on you niggas<br/>
Just tuned and watch em<br/>
I'm the real Fresh Prince, new crib in Bel Air<br/>
And I feel so free, the cheetah print in my hair<br/>
Rainbow on the belt, gang shit yeah yeah<br/>
I hopped out that bitch<br/>
Had to make some room for my furs<br/>
Niggas picking out there victims<br/>
Hot potato, hot potato<br/>
Tryna' cancel me on Twitter, but got limits on ya' data<br/>

I'm recordin this shit on the fuckin little mic<br/>
by the little, camera thing on the fuckin Macbook so...<br/>
This shit is choppy and bad quality, but fuck it<br/>
Wolf Gang, Ace Creator..<br/>
<br/>
Somebody tell Justin Beiber that I'm fuckin comin<br/>
Ain't no point in runnin, I'm an eager, just a little queeger<br/>
So I catch him stretchin, have him guessin where his cracker throat<br/>
Chop his balls off and use his skin to make a baby coat<br/>
Ain't he dope? No, (OH!) he the same as shit that Tyler wrote<br/>
This is Ace, Wolf is in the back with Travis snortin coke<br/>
Riley's here, Connie's dead, pickin pussy pissin pike<br/>
She won't leave, dick as big as Kelly Price's appetite<br/>
Apprehend a couple men, triple six is fuckin sin<br/>
Make Queen Latifah and Sydney go slap a couple dykes<br/>
Wrap around until they hit the ground and they hear a sound<br/>
that doesn't make sense like nigger kids wearin cap and gowns<br/>
This my album, and when your parents try to come around<br/>
Do the FUCKIN' exact opposite of turnin it down<br/>
And when they try to get parental and start talkin loud<br/>
Tell 'em that you're from the WOLF GANG and you're fuckin proud<br/>
Then start barkin loud (AH!) 'til the neighbors wanna calm you down<br/>
But call the pigs who prol'ly come near in 'bout a half an hour<br/>
Tell them that you're sorry, you're a cow, took a fuckin shower<br/>
But make it in time for shitty re-runs of Rocket Power (okay)<br/>
This is the shit that is makin me cynical<br/>
The clinical attempts at schizophrenia's critical<br/>
Fuckin voices follow me, emulatin like Twitter roll<br/>
O.F. is the coldest thing, and I'm the fuckin general<br/>
So when I mention suicide, I'm bein Mr. Literal<br/>
Then poke inside nine capsules, FUCK it let's split a roll<br/>
Life is like a phone booth, these pigeons is the fuckin toll<br/>
1-800-FUCK-THIS-SHIT...<br/>
Seven years old in my heart, so I'm stayin gold<br/>
But when I fuckin' go, Lucifer will prol'ly have my soul<br/>
It's hot down there - FUCK that, bitch I'm hot as coals<br/>
Out the microwave, mixed with a bowl of yellow raviol'<br/>
Yellow firetruck and Arizona during summertime<br/>
in a turtle neck, thermal jeans, spin purple wine<br/>
Wolf Gang 'petein, gon' live, runnin outta time<br/>
..The fuck I give is the same as the next line<br/>
<i>[two bars length of silence]</i><br/>
(FUCK EVERYTHING) That's what my conscience said<br/>
Then it bunny-hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead<br/>
Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement<br/>
Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit...

Got a problem with the golf?<br/>
Fuck it, then pick a spot<br/>
Like you're eating lunch<br/>
And it's brunch<br/>
We could bring the beef<br/>
And the pots and the pans<br/>
Fuck it, we could bring a lot<br/>
I just want to know if you can come and suck a dick or not?<br/>
Hit her up, pick her up<br/>
In the front seat of my two seater vehicle<br/>
Hit the crib, grab the cuffs, take pictures of her butt<br/>
Where's your mouth open up?<br/>
I just want to know if you can come and suck a dick or what<br/>
The fuck am I yapping about?<br/>
It don't matter, I'm the one, hun<br/>
T is the sun and you're Saturn<br/>
Better stop with all of the chit chatter, bitch I'm the tongue I go dumb<br/>
Like the mental handicaps in the house, y'all kiss butt<br/>
Like a nap on the couch<br/>
T the shit, I'm the weird little BLAH<br/>
In your mouth you better brush<br/>
Like Hova shoulder<br/>
Told you boys it never stop<br/>
I just want to know if you gon' come and suck a dick or not?<br/>
Pink and yellow in the fit, yeah<br/>
Ballin now shit I wonder how I got here<br/>
Thanks to everyone whoever gave a fuck, yeah<br/>
A lot of niggas don’t no because I am yeah<br/>
They told me to sit down, shit, I hate chairs<br/>
Fuck that instead I stood on their table<br/>
Flog Gnaw carnival, fuck ya state fair<br/>
If you fuck with the golf boys nigga say yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah....<br/>

Y'all niggas ain't fuckin' with T, man<br/>
Golf boys y'all ain't fuckin with me, man<br/>

Yo, I've seen a lot of niggas<br/>
So when them niggas start talkin' reckless, I get offended<br/>
I get it, they try to keep a image,<br/>
but look a little closer at the pictures and you see that they chameleons<br/>
How you doin'?<br/>
You in the motherfucking building?<br/>
Nigga, I'm an architect, got another crane and I don't know if Imma park it yet,<br/>
you ain't even start one yet, fuck off my property<br/>
Tell Australia I'm sneaking in with a mic in my damn hand<br/>
Instead of the vegetables that I packed in my backpack<br/>
When Marshall had this problem, what the fuck was they telling him?<br/>
Is it cause of status or his melanin lacks black? Huh?<br/>
I think people love to be mad<br/>
How can I be misogynist? I love titties and ass<br/>
How can I be homophobic when my boyfriend's a fag?<br/>
And we been hiding in the closet like our passion is fashion<br/>
Still trying to come out<br/>
Couldn't deal with niggas who decide to take the fun out<br/>
Probably cause I like to be in places where the sun out<br/>
So comparing niggas lights is a motherfucking bum out<br/>
Thought y'all nudist, but y'all clothes<br/>
I was 'bout to tee off and putt-putt till the end<br/>
Now it's Anti-Golf Boys cause I don't fuck with my friends<br/>
Worse thing they gave me was an opportunity and a pen<br/>
Freedom of speech? My freedom was breached<br/>
Border Patrol put me on streets immediately<br/>
For shit I said when I was a virgin repeatedly<br/>
Posting on Hypebeast cause nobody would listen to me<br/>
My child is product of me, very honest<br/>
Left of center, very different, they didn't want us<br/>
They didn't get us, didn't fit enough for their standards<br/>
Diverse and loud, so they ignore us<br/>
You put your life in a child that everybody hates<br/>
Now everybody hates papa despite that papa's great<br/>
But that's your favorite child boy that's your favorite one<br/>
(Kids?) Nope, I'm talking 'bout that Cherry Bomb<br/>
I don't think they hear it, I was fearing deteriorating<br/>
Almost ate my spirit til the children cheered along<br/>
Watching them sing the songs<br/>
Eyeballs inspired from Pilot to 2Seater, I couldn't steer them wrong<br/>
That's why I rode the Mclaren, couldn't stop at the Bimmer<br/>
""Tyler losing himself, and that nigga turned to a diva<br/>
Nigga preaching and smiling, nigga wilden' and breathing<br/>
Tryna inspire all the little niggas that wanna be him<br/>
But fuck that!, We want:<br/>
Cats cats daddy problems<br/>
Kickflip fuck fuck, cupcakes buttrape<br/>
Golf Wang, daddy problems fag fag dad dad<br/>
Bike lake everything that I hate, plus being sad""<br/>
Y'all can cry about your year's top rap new albums<br/>
Golf did a quarter million in about two hours<br/>
Money money ain't the motive, but it is up for discussion<br/>
Niggas frontin' niggas wish that they could fuck with my production<br/>
Saying you the plug, get your chords up<br/>
I was writing string sections on my tour bus<br/>
They adore me, my little birds<br/>
Be free flap your wings, I encourage it<br/>
I wish I had fucking xanax problem<br/>
So y'all talk about how I deep I am<br/>
Man-child in the flesh bitch I'm Peter Pan<br/>
You captain tier hook muthafuckas won't ever be the man<br/>
I got a muthafucking vision I don't need your plans<br/>
So shut your muthafucking mouth when I be speaking man<br/>
T the only sober nigga that be tweaking fam<br/>
<br/>
I don't like rapping like that

Yo, the only girl I ever loved<br/>
Fucked some nigga that I really hate<br/>
And the funny part about it that we didn't even date<br/>
But at the end she could still say she got her pussy ate<br/>
Yummy her in her tummy, pour out cause<br/>
Cummy in her bummy means that a little me being coming<br/>
So I let her blow my flute and start humming, bitch's brewin'<br/>
But that wasn't bubble gum that she was chewin'<br/>
Our relationship was like my music, chopped up, screwed up<br/>
Made her sick threw up, I gave her everything that wasn't enough<br/>
So I put two up, I'm hot, she cool, I call it a blue crush<br/>
We fucked, no kiss, that's it, fuck love<br/>
Snort drugs, make songs, go skate, daily life<br/>
Sarah or Dorothy, which one to make my wife<br/>
Or maybe I'll just marry both of them bitches, maybe twice<br/>
<br/>
I was in love, but fuck it<br/>
<br/>
Dorothy, my everything<br/>
She was my everything<br/>
Sarah, my lady,<br/>

<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Hello I'm a salesman sorta giant <br/>
I sell Molly and Mary <br/>
And other various items <br/>
One time one guy came to where I'm residing <br/>
And I didn't invite him, so instead tryin' fight him <br/>
I got violent, long story short he's not breathin'<br/>
For some reason I liked it and it was really exciting <br/>
Couldn't stop the addiction, and the irony is <br/>
A couple junkies went missing <br/>
And I know right where they're hiding <br/>
<br/>
Uhh<br/>

<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on my side <br/>
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high <br/>

Do-Dope in my bag, pretty bitch on my side <br/>
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna die <br/>
<br/>
Do-Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on my side <br/>
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna die <br/>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Task force poured into my fortress <br/>
Found some lipstick, a couple corpses <br/>
Bitches was harmed and they couldn't reach the alarm <br/>
I'm ripping sockets out like I had fucking problems with arms <br/>
They found a couple portraits on the porch<br/>
But they don't check up under the floor <br/>
It's bodies and hotties and we was raging I'm gauging a shotty <br/>
Hit so many bitches I was pimpin like Scotty <br/>
I'm a bull <br/>
Red<br/>
Piss me off<br/>
Like that lipstick position when she kissed me  <br/>
So I bit 'em off, they was too soft <br/>
I'm a wolf and a designer mixing skin, cotton, leather and wool <br/>
And most people like flying kites, riding bikes in the woods <br/>
Baking cake cause it's good, I mean I would if I could <br/>
But I like playing dress up and mix match <br/>
Sorry imma fess up, you aren't getting your kids back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on my side <br/>
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high <br/>

I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high <br/>
<br/>
Do-Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on my side <br/>

Unlike like my father, I can give you attention<br/>

Pack a few bags I got space in my mansions<br/>

Young Nigga got bread like a homeless shelter<br/>
I make snow angels with the cocaine<br/>
All my niggas keep heaters, we don't need jackets<br/>

<i>[Verse 1: Tyler]</i><br/>
Drip drop, the angels made a pit stop<br/>
Pissin' on the demons of the Earth<br/>
What's it really worth? Shit, now it's fuckin' pourin'<br/>
Wanted to go skate, can't, now my day is borin', damn<br/>
Snorin' in the bed with blankets cause my head spin<br/>
Probably cause I popped a couple purple Exedrins<br/>
It's a rainy day, so I'll skip the Led Zeppelin<br/>
And play some Sade ""Love Deluxe"" through my headset<br/>
On my way home I punched a bitch for an umbrella<br/>
Why? Cause I really didn't wanna get my shit wet<br/>
Run through the puddles, playin' in the mud<br/>
Fun, sucks that I'm too tall for the tub<br/>
Or would get my toys and make a lotta noise<br/>
While my mom is in the kitchen cookin' up a meal<br/>
Fire place is startin' up, dick is barely warmin' up<br/>
Sippy cup full of whip creamed hot chocolate<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Pharrell]</i><br/>
I can smell it when I go outside<br/>
Then it just pours<br/>
It gives us peace then all in the town is quiet<br/>
That's what rains for<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Pharrell]</i><br/>
All the kids see rain and scream ""No, no""<br/>
Run off the bus and they will just stay in<br/>
Me I love how rain fills the potholes<br/>
Me and my cell but that's what we played in<br/>
Ever wonder exactly where the sun goes<br/>
Did it go or did somethin' shade it?<br/>
The sun gives light cause it is the window<br/>
The rain gives life cause it is amazin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Tyler]</i><br/>
Lightning is striking, water hittin' on my window like Ike<br/>
I am not Tina, buddy, do not give my window pain<br/>
Lights bulbs when wearin' that wig, flyin' kites<br/>
Here's an idea, why don't I go hiking<br/>
On a fuckin' mountain where the water fountains icing<br/>
Stand there in a tank top prop that's from Baywatch<br/>
And eat about four bowls of some frozen ice cream<br/>
Get sick and then I won't have to<br/>
Go to school today, tomorrow, the day after<br/>
Sit in bed, write a bunch of raps up<br/>
And I won't be lyin' when I say I'm a sick rapper<br/>
Might fail so I won't bother<br/>
The sun is playin' hide and seek like my fuckin' father<br/>
The only difference is comes back, full effect<br/>
In the summer heats up, the thermometers erect<br/>
<br/>

That's the window into the sky<br/>

Tell Theresa May to let me in<br/>
I've been going in since 2010<br/>
It gotta be the color of my skin<br/>
Cause there's nigga's there<br/>
That doing more damage than my pen, man<br/>
Said some old lines was offensive<br/>
I was young, I can't apologize for that shit<br/>
They took my fiction literature for literal<br/>
I ain't no motherfuckin' criminal<br/>
The fuck is the problem, my record ain't got no smudges<br/>
Shit is clean as a whistle, and they just blow in them grudges<br/>
Let the kids see a show, that's what they waiting to see<br/>
It ain't no drugs on my bus, boy, my edges are straighter than me<br/>
So what the fuck is the problem? That lil Black boy made it<br/>
He's got a little bit of power and these white niggas hate it<br/>
And now he talking shit again, his stupid ass should have waited, fuck<br/>
They said I was a bad influence to who?<br/>
The camouflage following niggas like you?<br/>
Or all the free thinkers that know what it do?<br/>
Cause I'm one of them<br/>
See Ace is a king, I don't need your respect<br/>
So I made my own shoes, fuck that royalty check<br/>
I don't need your opinion, keep a mirror on deck<br/>
So don't you talk to me<br/>
<br/>
It might just be my ego<br/>
It might just be my ego<br/>
It might just be my ego right now<br/>
Clancy you should calm me down<br/>
It's my ego<br/>
Or maybe it's my ego<br/>
It might just be my motherfuckin' ego<br/>
<br/>
Well maybe it's my motherfuckin' ego when I'm ruling the world<br/>
And I ain't proving shit to niggas who just want me to fail<br/>
Niggas is fronting saying we distant cousins<br/>
While y'all pants was always flowing, all my trousers was flooded<br/>
Mad niggas be watching my moves, I never copped my props<br/>
For everybody and they momma got a problem with shock<br/>
Y'all niggas trash, y'all niggas trash (Goddamn lies is over niggas)<br/>
Same niggas laugh when you making shit<br/>
Then three years later wanna emulate the shit you did<br/>
Y'all pay the price<br/>
Ask some old friends, that shit is over and finished<br/>
Look around in the crowd, them niggas not even attendance<br/>
That shit is done, and Lionel my witness<br/>
But I had to move on cause I can't fuck with them niggas<br/>
I shut it down<br/>
Now wow, now he's saying that one day<br/>
He found his wings, now he using 'em on his runway<br/>
Nigga yellow, blue and orange, shit is dark<br/>
Different battle, you say the same shit from the start<br/>
Niggas I am a wave, y'all just fuck with the sharks<br/>
And I got flames on my pants cause I walk how I talk<br/>
So keep them comments, keep them comments, keep them comments, boy<br/>
When it's said and done my pockets gon' be filled with commas, boy<br/>
Y'all <i>[?]</i>, y'all saying this<br/>
Y'all niggas say that shit is gross, that shit is nasty, eww get away boy, I'm good<br/>
<br/>
And if you see my old friends, tell 'em that I really miss 'em but I'm good<br/>
And if you see some bad times, tell 'em I don't really miss 'em, boy I'm good<br/>
And if you see my old self, tell him not to worry cause he'll be good<br/>
Sorry my feelings is running, GOLF 2016, thank you niggas for coming<br/>

Hey guys (Golf Wang!)<br/>

You know me, you see my laptop, I mean<br/>
Apple is pretty mainstream but I have underground stickers<br/>
So it levels out..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Domo Genesis]</i><br/>
Y'all niggas got it twisted, we ain't the Misfits<br/>
We the sick shit, make the competition slit wrists<br/>
Bodybag, beats get rapped like it's Christmas<br/>
Popping tags, I stay in Dior cause I'm Christian<br/>
Nigga listen: I been killing this since I was the<br/>
Age of the face that R. Kelly pissed in<br/>
In the booth, I'm brawling to be like the Pistons<br/>
Only smoke flyin', you can't hit if you ain't pitched in!<br/>
And bitch stop talking, let the marijuana sink in<br/>
And when that chauffeur roll up, you better get in<br/>
You and your 6 friends, even your big friend<br/>
Got a gang of wolves that slay hoes like henchmen<br/>
OF kill someone, yeah nigga we shipped it<br/>
Local ass nigga, we overseas on you dipshits<br/>
Walking flex tweet, motherfucker take a Twitpic<br/>
Kidnapped the game and it won't quit bitching<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Tyler the Creator]</i><br/>
Duct tape, butter knife, now I'm breaking in homes<br/>
Now I'm in the cloud with Kelly, we're watching the throne<br/>
Until I get that motherfucker, I'll be watching your home<br/>
Then I try to go harder than Niagara Boulder<br/>
Look like <i>[?]</i><br/>
And all about a bunch of fucking Lindsay Lohans<br/>
That don't even know me, trying to give me that old handjob<br/>
Fuck that ho! Blow me<br/>
The GI Joe of OF is slowly<br/>
Slowly running shit, his toes are swollen<br/>
Gobbler left the bridge, no more patrolling<br/>
Stick my finger in any hole I can find: fuck bowling!<br/>
I'm making that virgin bone me<br/>
In that green shit that grew and it stuck, my bank account is moldy<br/>
Me and Wanda Sykes is holding<br/>
Hands til I eat her cooter like a bowl of ravioli<br/>
Chef Boyar-T, on tour, had to make a couple pit stops<br/>
Ended up at a fucking hipster club called the Pink Drop<br/>
When they said they hated on me and Odd Future kids<br/>
And how much they really love underground hip-hop<br/>
We don't give a fuck! Like a virginized dick cock<br/>
After being tickled by a couple of these bitch shops<br/>
Young niggas, OF got this<br/>
Come to my show and see niggas in the mosh pit<br/>
Cat on my cotton<br/>
Zebra print 5 panel from Jebbia Now I'm flyer than an ostrich<br/>
VMA-nom, yes, video my set<br/>
Harder than Nakel nak, nollie-ing a nine-set<br/>
Thrasher, Billboard, couple of them issues<br/>
Boy flow colder than a face stuck in igloo<br/>
I'ma fuck the game until my herpes covered dick's bruised

Of this song, shit<br/>

Pull out the guitar and learn some new chords from Anita Baker<br/>
Baker got some acres out the window when you wake up<br/>
I'm a fish sign my b'day march and put its knee up<br/>
Bunch of yes sergeants 'till we barge in on them tea cups<br/>
