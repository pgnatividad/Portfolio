# Technical Take Home Challenge Simulation

### Goal
- This challenge was designed to simulate technical take home challenges from companies.
- This gives students the opportunity to practice and reinforce skills they learn during the General Assembly Data Science Immersive Course.
- There is no solution code as these challenges are intended to help students practice without ever given the chance to know the "answer", reinforce that there are multiple ways to tackle a problem and and that not all problems have perfect answers.

## Challenge:

 ## Traffic Violations Data

### Provided Materials:
  - StopData1.csv
  - StopData2.csv
  - CourtsDataV2.csv
  
### Your Task:
1. Calculate the mean ticket amounts for men and women (tickets are given out in $0.50 increments)
2. Test and explain whether any difference you observe between men's and women's ticket amounts is large.
3. Do some officers tend to give larger tickets?
4. Do some Wards tend to have larger tickets?
5. Make a case for the variables and model(s) that best predict ticket status (challenged, paid, overdue, etc.).
6. Write a 1 page summary of your findings

### Guidelines:
1. You may use any resources you have available on your computer (notes, lessons, Google, etc), but you may not ask your classmates questions.
    - Remember - This is to get further along in the interview process - they are your competetion!
2. You have 2 hours to complete the task - this will be strictly timed!
3. You will then give a 5-7min presentation your findings. Present this as though you were speaking to the company's hiring committee!
