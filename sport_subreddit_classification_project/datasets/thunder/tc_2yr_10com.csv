"What do y'all think about this trade scenario?

LBJ accept to join us and George opt in, but we gotta clear some salary space.
Sadly, Steve is the only expendable piece with a consistent contract.

- TRADE 1:
Steven Adams (24,1mln x 4) and 53th pick to Dallas
Finney-Smith (1,5 mln x 2), Matthews (18,6mln x 1) and 5th pick to OKC

(Dallas got 4,5mln $ from Trade Exception)

DALLAS PROS: 
- They get one of the best center in NBA. 
- Their appeal grow a lot in view of FA.

DALLAS CONS:
- They lose their pick that seems to be good.

OKC PRO:
- We stretch our bench with a defender wing and a veteran guard who can shoot 3's
- We can draft a big man like Jaren Jackson or Mo Bamba or Wendell Carter Jr. and move him in our starting lineup right away.
- We save 4mln$ from Salary Cap

OKC CONS:
- We lose a smart and consistent player like Steve.

TRADE 2:
Both Melo and LeBron opt in.

Cavs get Carmelo Anthony (28mln $) , Terrance Ferguson (2,1mln$), Kyle Singler (5mln$)

OKC get Lebron James (35,6 mln$)

 
The situation is as follows:

PG Russ (35,350,000 x 4)
SG Roberson (10,000,000 x 2)
SF George (20,703,384 x 1)
PF James (35,600,968 x 1)
C Bamba (3,841,000 x 3 + Option)

Bench:
Matthews (18,622,514 x 1)
Abrines (5,455,236 x 1+1 (QO))
Patterson (5,451,600 x 1+1 (PO))
Finney-Smith (1,544,951 x 1+1 (NG))
Dakari Johnson  (1,378,242 x 1 + 1 (QO))
57th pick (looking for a backup PG)

TOTAL CAP 2018-2019: about 138$ mln

We lose young players like T-Ferg and Grant, but the next year we got a future star like Bamba and more than 50mln$ cap (giving up on Matthews and LBJ) in order to rebuilt our team.

"With two years left on his contract and watching his team on the verge of collapse, it seems likely that Love will be traded away to clear up some space and start a rebuild. So in this hypothetical, let's assume LeBron leaving Cleveland (I'd put that at a ~70% chance).   
 
Why would OKC want Kevin Love? If we did get him, he'd likely start at the 4. Our lineup would look like WB/Robes/PG (or Grant if he leaves)/Love/Adams
  
* We don't have a backup center when Adams is out. Kevin Love would be a great guy to rotate from the 4 to 5 and put PPatt or Grant at the 4.  
   
* Love shot 42% from the 3 last season. Consistent 3 point shooting is of utmost importance for OKC, who've regularly gone dry and relied on Westbrook's magic to score  
  
* Piggybacking off of that last point, imagine the amazing spacing that we'd enjoy. Imagine that lethal WB/Adams P&R with Love at the key if Adams gets stuffed.  
  
* People give Love a ton of crap due to his poor defense. But we have 3 amazing (future all-NBA defense IMO) defenders in PG, Robes, and Grant, and then Adams, Westbrook, and PPatt who are all also above average at defense. If Donovan has done one thing right, it's his defensive schemes, and it resulted in OKC being one of the best defending teams this season until Robes went down. 
   
* This is a stretch, but having Love in OKC could help in us land LeBron. But if the Cavs trade Love before LeBron leaves, they'd have to be 100% confident they're losing him.  

* Westbrook and Love were roommates at UCLA. I'm sure they'd love to be teammates here.  
  
OKC is the perfect destination for Love, IMO. We mask his deficiencies and his strengths are much needed by OKC. Getting Love could also help PG decide to resign with us, as it's a great roster upgrade.  
  
Now what are the downsides? What will it cost us?  
  
* Ideally, we'd trade Melo. That's a big upside IMO, but he's gonna have waive his NTC to go the Cavs, who'll probably buy him out. I doubt he does that.    
 
* Idk about everyone else here, but I'm optimistically confident that Kanter opts out and decides to come back to OKC. He's hinted at it a few times on his social. If we get Kanter, there isn't much reason to get Love too. He may be cheaper and he already has the OKC team chemistry. 
  
* We don't have any picks till 2022 IIRC. This is probably the worst aspect of this trade. We'll almost certainly lose Abrines and/or T-Ferg, or possibly even Grant in a sign-and-trade, probably to the Cavs or in a three-way trade. 
  
* Love is nearing 30, has two more years in his contract, and is a bit injury prone.

"I was listening to a podcast of his and he gave an interesting solution to the Melo issue. Give Melo an ultimatum. Tell him that if he ops into his player-option that he will play 6 minutes a game and come off the bench. Or they could begin buyout discussions. The buyout terms Bill gave were that the thunder would pay Melo 15M of the 28M he is owed. Allowing him to become a free agent and sign with a team willing to pay him the remainder of his deal (and possible more) or sign with a contender on a minimum or near minimum deal but have a shot at a deep playoff run. Of course in contract buyouts the player and organization must agree on the terms so we don’t know if that offer would be appealing to Melo but it’s something.

This move would allow the thunder to make a minor splash in free agency and give them something to look forward too.

"I think Billy Donovan is a good coach. He is better than Scotty Brooks imo and it is not particularly close. Let me illustrate this:

1. Billy Donovan has consistently shown that he knows the correct moves to make in playoff situations. He made the correct adjustments against the Spurs, and against the Warriors in 2016. I do not recall a single series in which Scotty Brooks started off with the right lineup. He played Perk way too much and spotted other teams a eight point lead in Q1 and he did this for every year since 2011. BD knew exactly where to hit the Warriors, designing our defensive schemes to stick the ball in non shooters hands, and ensuring we crashed the offensive glass. He did a similar thing vs the Spurs, and if not for the LMA explosion, we might have won in 5.

2.  Against the Rockets last year, we had a limited roster. Our team just wasn't very good. The fact that we were there at   
all was a testament to Russ. BD made the correct rotations, cut off Harden's driving lanes and thus it was a very ugly   
series. We had no shooting, and their shooters were bad, due in part to good defense.

Having said all that, the 17/18 season was a failure on BD's part and I'm going to try to elaborate why. The reason I mentioned the previous things were to show that he has shown in the past that he is an excellent coach.

Now I'm going to bring something up which will draw a lot of hate. Russell Westbrook is difficult to coach. Let me explain. What makes Russ special?

His passion, his intensity, his fundamental explosion and lack of control that pushes him over others. These are the features that make Russ the player he is. You cannot coach him like you would a Tony Parker or a Mike Conley. Russ is like a thoroughbred stallion, if you want him at his best, you must let him run free. You cannot stick him in one corner or have him run 20 PNR sets in a row. That isn't maximizing his impact.

In 2016/17, BD understood that this was the team's best way to succeed. It worked. However, I am still very angry at how the 17/18 season has turned out. Melo is not the same Melo, but this team, even without Robes, should have advanced a round in the playoffs. We were still a more talented basketball team than the Utah Jazz. So what happened? Here's another question\- why has OKC never had an actual offensive system? Under Brooks, Under Donovan\- it seems like freelancing. 

Well, the answer to that is that the coaches have always attempted to play to the strengths of the players. Durant and Russ are two unstoppable scorers. And guess what? The lack of offensive system ALMOST WON THE DAMN CHIP. Fundamentally, coaching isn't about some stupid principles of basketball. It is about communicating with your players, recognizing their strengths, their weaknesses, and making a system that suits them. There isn't a right or wrong way to play basketball as long as you follow these tenets. The best coaches only differ 5\-10 percent from the worst ones. That said, I believe the 17/18 season was failure at an organizational level.

We took 3 pieces with talent \(say what you will about Melo being washed up, but he has basketball talent\) and basically just flung shit at the wall. BD let Russ go last season, but now that he had two other teammates who could help, he didn't have the authority to rein him in. The team still played like last season. Why? Why was no adjustment made to the offense to account for PG and Melo? We say Melo has failed here, and he has been atrocious. But Melo is a player who needs rhythm to get going. He cannot be made a spot up shooter and succeed. PG luckily for us is a player who fits in well everywhere as he is a number 2 mentally.  But the simple fact is this\- a coach needs to understand how to manage egos. If BD cannot tell Russ anything and expect him to listen, that is a failure on part of both BD and Russ.  There are ways to manage egos.

Melo doesn't want to come off the bench? Yank him early on, and give him some accountability by running him out with the second unit. Make him feel appreciated, not marginalized. When we did this for a stretch, we started winning games!! This year, we went away from the principles that we had as an organization. That principle was\- above all\- play to the players strengths. We did not support Paul George and Melo to play to their strengths.

If Russell Westbrook cannot understand this, then we need to hire a coach he respects. I am disappointed in him. He was the MVP because he did whatever he had to to win. This is what makes him special. He didn't run away when the burden came on him. This year, he fell into a trap of genuine stat chasing. 

We can still absofuckinglutely win a title with Westbrook as the best player. But, we need not only complimentary pieces\- we also need Russ to understand that winning is not all about him, and every player on the entire team needs to have their strengths played to. If BD no longer has any authority, he needs to go. Sam Presti, you're my only hope.","Scotty Brooks, Billy Donovan And Russ I think Billy Donovan is a good coach.

"If the Spurs were willing to accept an offer of Adams, Ferguson, Abrines and 2 x future 1sts for Kawhi Leonard (with assurance of him resigning) do you make the trade?

"Before he ended up coming to OKC reports said he only wanted to go to Cleveland or Houston. The trailblazers also became a rumored spot because Dame and CJ wanted him or something. I think these could be somewhat realistic trade options. 

Houston

Houston is most likely I think. The only reason Melo didn’t end up in Houston was because no one wanted Ryan Anderson’s contract. I think Anderson would be a good fit in OKC, he basically does what everyone wants Melo to do— stand in the corner and space the floor. I think Melo is a better defender but it’s not that much of a gap. Trevor Ariza could leave in free agency which could let Melo maybe even start in Houston.

Cleveland

This is contingent on Lebron staying, which I don’t think is likely. After the moves last year (basically signing every old guy for the minimum) failing, I don’t think it makes much sense for Cleveland but it’s possible. I think it would take a Kevin Love trade request to get done and even then I don’t think Melo and Ferg for K Love would beat out another teams offer. Basically, LeBron would have to demand a Carmelo trade to stay in Cleveland.

Portland

Portland has a lot of bad contracts, Evan Turner, Meyers Leonard, Moe Harkless. Trading off some of those contracts for one year of Melo may be worth it to the blazers. We could even potentially get a draft pick back as well. 

I think Melo could be an elite 6 man at this point  and hope he can come to terms with where he’s at in his career trajectory right now. But he’s a personality for sure and there may be a break up looming. Anything can happen, so let me know your thoughts :)

"Now, this isn't just me shitting on Russ. He's actually my favorite player in the league and probably my favorite dude in all of sports. But I was watching some highlights of him (because fuck every team left in the playoffs) and I've come more and more to the conclusion that Russ would actually be better off being a secondary ball handler on the team than the primary one. Or at least in a system with more of a team concept.  
  
First when I was watching his highlights I saw ""hey, Russ is actually pretty good on Catch and Shoot 3s"". So I went to find out his percentages on them, and then I ended up in a bit of a rabbit hole.  
  
Russ on Catch and Shoot 3s: 0.4/1.1 per game (36.0%)  
  
Only 1.1 per game so relatively small sample size but pretty good. In contrast, he's Russ on pull-up 3s.  
  
Russ on Pull-Up 3s: 0.8/2.9 per game (27.9%)  
  
So then I looked and realized most of Russ' inefficiencies overall come from the pull up mid-range. It's actually his most favored shot (10.3 per game) but he only makes 35.5% of them (3.6 per games). For comparison he takes 6.2 shots per game and makes 49.6% of them. The rest of his offense is paint touches (0.6/1.1 per game = 53.8%) and post ups (0.2/0.5 = 41.0%). So basically that crappy pull up midrange is the shot he takes most per game despite barely making it and if he cut down on those he'd be a much more efficient player.  
  
But then again I went deeper and looked at Russ' offense by play type. 
  
ISOLATION - 17.5% Frequency, 0.82 Points Per Possession, 36.4% FG, 42th percentile  
TRANSITION - 23.2% Frequency, 1.01 Points per possession, 55.2% FG, 33rd percentile  
PNR BALL HANDLER - 31.8% Frequency, O.85 Points per possession, 45.6% FG, 62nd percentile  
POST-UP - 7.0% Frequency, 0.83 PPP, 38.0% FG, 41th percentile  
SPOT-UP - 6.9% Frequency, 0.89 PPP, 39.3% FG, 34th percentile  
HAND-OFF - 2.9% Frequency, 0.67 PPP, 34.5% FG, 15th percentile  
CUT -1.2% Frequency, 1.30 PPP, 68.2% FG, 58th percentile  
OFF-SCREEN- 1.0% Frequency, 1.14 PPP, 45.0% FG, 79th percentile  
PUTBACKS - 3.3% Frequency, 1.05, 50.8% FG, 42th percentile  
  
So Russ's most used play type is the Pick and Roll which he's clearly good at, in the 62th percentile. But then what stands out is how bad he actually is in isolation. He's only in the 42th percentile and only at 0.82 points per possession even though he did 5 per game. He's also surprisingly inefficient in transition but he led the league in transition points and is 1.01 Points Per Possession so it's still good for him to get out and run although he should definitely work on his decision making in transition at times. But what else pops is the fact that despite barely doing them, he's actually pretty good off cuts and screens. If he played without the ball in his hands as much he'd be able use that side of his game and keep his high scoring numbers at a better efficiency. Cutting out the pull-ups and replacing them with more off-ball buckets would round out his game really well and open up things for everyone else.  
  
I know a lot of people have said this for a while but I just wanted to go thru the stats to see if it was a matter of Russ NEEDING the have the ball in his hands all the time to make an impact or not. And by my analysis the answer is clearly no. He and Donovan just need to trust leaving the ball in other guys hands and letting get back to him naturally instead of forcing it.  
  
TL;DR: Russ is surprising good at Catch and Shoot 3, terrible at pull-ups, terrible in isolation, surprisingly good at scoring off cuts and screens. Replacing all the bad pull-up shots with cuts and coming off screens would make him a more efficient player. Take the ball out of his hands a bit more and give more creative load to PG (if he stays) and Adams (who can grow into a Gasol/Horford-eqsue passer hopefully)","Russ should be more off-ball Now, this isn't just me shitting on Russ.

PNR BALL HANDLER - 31.8% Frequency, O.85 Points per possession, 45.6% FG, 62nd percentile  
POST-UP - 7.0% Frequency, 0.83 PPP, 38.0% FG, 41th percentile  
SPOT-UP - 6.9% Frequency, 0.89 PPP, 39.3% FG, 34th percentile  
HAND-OFF - 2.9% Frequency, 0.67 PPP, 34.5% FG, 15th percentile  
CUT -1.2% Frequency, 1.30 PPP, 68.2% FG, 58th percentile

PUTBACKS - 3.3% Frequency, 1.05, 50.8% FG, 42th percentile  
  
So Russ's most used play type is the Pick and Roll which he's clearly good at, in the 62th percentile. But then what stands out is how bad he actually is in isolation. He's only in the 42th percentile and only at 0.82 points per possession even though he did 5 per game. He's also surprisingly inefficient in transition but he led the league in transition points and is 1.01 Points Per Possession so it's still good for him to get out and run although he should definitely work on his decision making in transition at times. But what else pops is the fact that despite barely doing them, he's actually pretty good off cuts and screens. If he played without the ball in his hands as much he'd be able use that side of his game and keep his high scoring numbers at a better efficiency. Cutting out the pull-ups and replacing them with more off-ball buckets would round out his game really well and open up things for everyone else.  
  
I know a lot of people have said this for a while but I just wanted to go thru the stats to see if it was a matter of Russ NEEDING the have the ball in his hands all the time to make an impact or not. And by my analysis the answer is clearly no. He and Donovan just need to trust leaving the ball in other guys hands and letting get back to him naturally instead of forcing it.  
  
TL;DR: Russ is surprising good at Catch and Shoot 3, terrible at pull-ups, terrible in isolation, surprisingly good at scoring off cuts and screens. Replacing all the bad pull-up shots with cuts and coming off screens would make him a more efficient player. Take the ball out of his hands a bit more and give more creative load to PG (if he stays) and Adams (who can grow into a Gasol/Horford-eqsue passer hopefully)",17,26,Russ should be more off-ball,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/8lpj84/russ_should_be_more_offball/

Russell’s prime window is wide open currently. I can’t NOT SEE the similarities on both of these windows.

I think Billy isn’t the right guy to lead us to the promised land, great guy and a fine coach but not for this team.

I guess faith is the only thing that is left but I feel that history is doomed to repeat itself with another excuse or reason for a season falling short. I hope to hell I’m wrong. Organically we haven’t grown enough to play from a position of power. Granted you play the cards you are dealt but basketball in this town means more to a lot of people and failing isn’t an option with a player of Westbrook’s magnitude.

I think Billy isn’t the right guy to lead us to the promised land, great guy and a fine coach but not for this team. My faith in Presti is running out but give him plenty of credit for the exceptional job he has done and the moves he has made, good or bad.

I guess faith is the only thing that is left but I feel that history is doomed to repeat itself with another excuse or reason for a season falling short. I hope to hell I’m wrong. Organically we haven’t grown enough to play from a position of power. Granted you play the cards you are dealt but basketball in this town means more to a lot of people and failing isn’t an option with a player of Westbrook’s magnitude.  

I do look forward to the future, one thing that is certain is the uncertainty.

Thunder Up!

"Hey guys, I just wanted to take all of y'all back to 2014. We faced the Clippers in Round 2, and I remembered the Clippers were huge favorites to win against us. Part of the reason we were going to lose was the 'genius' that is Chris Paul, who was absolutely 'better' than that overrated chucker Russell Westbrook.

Game 1, CP went 8/9 from 3 and scored 32. Russ had a good 29 point game himself but the Clippers absolutely blew us out. Just as predicted, right?

Well, let me throw some simple numbers at y'all. 31, 23, 27, 38. Westbrook outscored Paul in EVERY other game in the series, and utterly dominated him. Paul put up numbers and had one of the largest choke jobs in Game 5, throwing away the ball 2 times in the final 17 seconds. Westbrook bruised CP out of the way every single time they faced each other, and played incredible defense all series long.

We won in 6, and CP went home early as always.

"I know r/thunder thinks KD is a snake for quitting on a team up 3-1 against GSW. We were up 3-1 because of KD's greatness. Hell, put KD on any team and most likely he would be able to win any series.

The problem was Golden State's brand of basketball. They were clearly unstoppable with their space and pace. 

Here's what I think were the key issues with KD's departure:
1) Replacing Scott Brooks for Billy Donovan. There was alot of lost continuity. Presti knew Brooks may not have been the best X's and O's coach. However, Brooks was the guy for KD and Russ. 
I don't know how you also replace Brooks for a college coach who ran a simplistic offense in college basketball. He had a pretty good trap defense and 3-2 zone. 
I would say that Billy Donovan would have been a great hire maybe post-KD. But not now. If they hired a former NBA champion coach or former NBA player that has been an assistant, they might have had more success.

2) Monty Williams was an unfortunate departure. Him + Billy was a good combo.
I think Monty was a good fit for OKC.

3) Presti has alot to blame for this. Heat and Cavs built around LeBron James. How do you win with LeBron? Just pair the guy with shooters. LeBron had Mike Miller, Ray Allen, Chalmers, Wade, Bosh on the  Heat. Cavs are all 3 point shooters.
Presti gave KD for several seasons locked up Westbrook and Roberson. For a player of KD's talents, it was just not a good fit for his brand of basketball. 
I really think if Presti found a starting shooting guard who was a knock down 3 point shooter KD would have stayed. It was clear that KD knew nothing would change. OKC will focus on length and defense. KD wanted to play with pace and space.

Alot guys might hate this post. But I actually enjoy seeing KD flourish right now. Alot more than James Harden who keeps flopping and gimmicking his way to score points and play no defense. KD should be all-NBA defense this year. ","Watching KD be unstoppable shows how Presti could not get the right players around KD.

"This season just doesn't make any sense. Donovan never adjusted our defensive scheme once Roberson went down.

We saw how effective it was when we stopped double teaming beyond 3 point line and were running more switching defenses in 2nd half of game 5 and game 6. Quinn Snyder mentioned it in post game of game 4. We saw so much less open 3s because we changed the scheme.

Why does Donovan get a pass for this season because Roberson went down? Brooks gets fired despite KD missing most of 2015 season? This season just doesn't make any sense. Donovan never adjusted our defensive scheme once Roberson went down.

We saw how effective it was when we stopped double teaming beyond 3 point line and were running more switching defenses in 2nd half of game 5 and game 6. Quinn Snyder mentioned it in post game of game 4. We saw so much less open 3s because we changed the scheme.

"Let me be clear. Sam Presti is a top 5 GM in this league. I am biased, but I do think that his intelligence, his creativity, and his dedication to his job is a thing of beauty. I was just thinking about his various transactions, and the thing that came out to strike me is that his decisions are almost always correct in the context of the situation, but external factors combine to fuck him over in an unfortunate way.

1. The Harden Trade- Look, we have all swallowed a bunch of crap on Reddit for this move. But at the time, we were screwed over by-
i. A cheap Owner

ii. The Rose Rule Grandfathering KD's contract- this is not talked about enough. Presti had his plans laid out in a specific way, but the financials were fucked over by the massive increase to the money owed to Durant

iii. Ultimately, we did not know that Harden would be a superstar. Allstar, maybe, but almost no one (including Darryl Morey) saw THIS out of him.

In the intervening period between the Harden trade and the KD departure, we had absolutely horrible luck. We were coached by Scotty Brooks (great guy, empowering coach but not a good coach) and suffered from a bout of horrific injuries in 2013, 2014/ 2015.

With Durant's FA only a year away, Sam had to do something to push us over the top. The Enes Kanter acquisition and contract have been criticized, but, ultimately, it allowed us to get something back for him. 2016 was the year we should have won it all. We had the most talented team, top to bottom in the league. Had we beaten the Warriors, we would have (in my opinion) given the Cavs more than they could have handled (especially on defense)

Durant left, and I am one of the few who do not fault him entirely for it. Look, everytime KD turns the TV on (and we know how much he loves hearing what people think about him, lol) he sees Charles Barkley being chastised by Shaq for not winning a chip. I believe in his mind he saw a 75 percent chance at contention with us, and a 100 percent chance with the Warriors. It was a weak move, but I get where he came from.

Anyways, Presti made some solid moves last year. Getting rid of a declining Ibaka, getting back Oladipo, the Taj Gibson midseason acquisition etc. Last year was a phenomenally fun season for me (and for most of you I think). The Russ show was more entertaining than I ever experienced during contention.

During the offseason, Sam Presti acquired Carmelo Anthony and Paul George. I was beyond hyped. Two (at the time) elite wings to go with Russ who could both score? We were at least in the second bracket if not overall contenders!

At the time, this move by Presti was Lauded. And you know what? I would do it 100 times out of 100. The most valuable commodity in this league is talent, and guess what, he got talent. Fit ultimately is what killed the chances of this roster, rather than the individual talents of the players (Except Melo, Melo is just washed).

I guess what this rambling piece is trying to talk about is that we need to have faith in Sam Presti. He is the one who is always trying to help us, and though it doesn't always work out, he is amazing at his job. Even if PG doesn't stay and our cap is fucked, I have faith that this man can find a solution, and you should too.","Sam Presti- The Tragic Genius Let me be clear.

"Okay now hear me out guys. There's two main arguments here. There's people who think Russ is the problem and then there's people who think Billy is the problem. 

Now let's say theoretically (because we actually don't know) that Russ is the problem. Then in my opinion no matter what I think it's up to the coach to discipline your players. Now even if Russ doesn't listen to Billy or follow his offesnict shemes then I still think it's on Billy. I mean if you don't have control of your players then your just not respected enough or have the authoritative power. If you can't do that then I believe your just a bad coach.

Now we all know Billy plays the dumbest rotations. I feel like there truth to what melo said about how thunder didn't utilize him properly. I mean at the beginning of the season melo was running with the bench and then Billy switched it up to PG running with the bench which didn't work as well. Also Billy gave up alot of minutes to T-Ferg which imo could of went to 2pat or grant.

Now take in the game with GSW when they didn't have melo and Andre. Huestis is essentially a replica of Andre. He has the athletic ability but yet Billy didn't want to utilize him in later games. This is just poor coaching.

I mean you look at coaches like Brad Stevens and he's taking a bunch of young players to the semi finals. It's all about implementing a system and Billy just lacks that ability.

You guys all give him credibility about the WCF with Durant. Realistically even at that point OKC was still GSW kryptonite. Don't forget their biggest weakness is athletic bigs. Don't give Billy credit where credit ain't due. Any thoughts?","Billy is the problem Okay now hear me out guys. There's two main arguments here.

"Now first, I just want to say I've never been a coach at any level, I'm just an OKC fan who wants to see our offense get better (or more importantly, more organized). I've seen a lot of people talk how we should run a motion style offense ala the Spurs and Warriors but I've explained on here many times why IMO that can't work (not enough shooting, our players aren't great at passing). So then, I looked into other systems. The Triangle wouldn't work for us because it pretty much turns the point guard into an off-ball player, the high post offense would require Adams to be a better shooter, we can't play small ball with Adams, etc. However one system did seem like it could work. Spain's offense that they've been running for years.  
  
A lot of big NBA fans probably have heard of a play that has become very popular around the league called ""Spain"" or the ""Spain Pick and Roll"". [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3nHqWA3vJk) a video explaining it, basically the Spain Pick and Roll is the Point Guard receives a screen from the Center who THEN receives a back screen from a third player allowing him to roll to the rim. The third player then often flairs out to the top of the key.  
  
Now, despite the narrative than Billy Donovan never runs anything and we have no structured offense, this is actually something we've run A LOT. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTQUB5ZXUwQ) is a compilation of OKC running the Spain PnR during the 2016-17 (tbh I don't remember us using it in the 2017-18 system, and God knows watching us this season PG and Melo don't ever want to screen). Watching this compilation you can see how effective it is for Russ allowing him to get into the lane. One thing I will say is that outside of Abrines (who happens to be Spanish), the second screener always seemed to be the PF who would rarely actually flair out to the top. But theoretically, PG could be great as the flair out man at the top of the arc as that's one of his favorite shots (Patterson as well seems to like that spot).  
  
So that's the Spain PnR but what about the rest of the offense? [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpB8NVHidhE&t=12s) is the Spain Elbow series. Now we often see Adams receive the ball at the elbow but it almost always just leads to a dribble handoff. More cutting around Adams instead would keep defenses more honest and give us a different look. It would depend on Adams improving as a passer but I don't doubt he should be able to based on his intelligence as a player and rate of improvement every year. And it's easy to imagine Grant as the PF roll man on these plays with PG/Abrines coming around on the weak side for this action.  
  
Then we have stuff like [Spain Zipper Elevator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISjv57X0NVk) (which is just a variation of the elevator play with a zipper cut) and Spain running [Horns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HsxdL8UqA8) (it's a bit harder imagining us ever pass the ball this much on one possession) and here's just a [compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFSiUh5eh-w) of some other Spain run, but the bigger point I'm trying to get across is that with the personnel we have it is possible to run a system as long as we get everyone to buy in. It also feels like running this would get Adams a lot more involved in more than just rebounding which IMO is a good thing. Tbh, watching this it feels like Donovan does a lot of similar actions but the players don't really commit to running it (i.e don't screen hard or cut hard) but hopefully with more continuity with the roster we can have a fully formed offense and not just whatever the hell it is we do now. But the players have to buy in and Donovan has to commit to instilling it into them.  
  
For more, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrrxmZqhXDw&t=295s) the former Spain National Team explaining his style of play in full and [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIT5TmEmRlY) Spain in the 3rd place game at Eurobasket 2017 ~~(featuring our boy Alex ;)~~ he was injured for this game :().

Now, despite the narrative than Billy Donovan never runs anything and we have no structured offense, this is actually something we've run A LOT. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTQUB5ZXUwQ) is a compilation of OKC running the Spain PnR during the 2016-17 (tbh I don't remember us using it in the 2017-18 system, and God knows watching us this season PG and Melo don't ever want to screen). Watching this compilation you can see how effective it is for Russ allowing him to get into the lane. One thing I will say is that outside of Abrines (who happens to be Spanish), the second screener always seemed to be the PF who would rarely actually flair out to the top. But theoretically, PG could be great as the flair out man at the top of the arc as that's one of his favorite shots (Patterson as well seems to like that spot).  
  
So that's the Spain PnR but what about the rest of the offense? [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpB8NVHidhE&t=12s) is the Spain Elbow series. Now we often see Adams receive the ball at the elbow but it almost always just leads to a dribble handoff. More cutting around Adams instead would keep defenses more honest and give us a different look. It would depend on Adams improving as a passer but I don't doubt he should be able to based on his intelligence as a player and rate of improvement every year. And it's easy to imagine Grant as the PF roll man on these plays with PG/Abrines coming around on the weak side for this action.  
  
Then we have stuff like [Spain Zipper Elevator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISjv57X0NVk) (which is just a variation of the elevator play with a zipper cut) and Spain running [Horns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HsxdL8UqA8) (it's a bit harder imagining us ever pass the ball this much on one possession) and here's just a [compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFSiUh5eh-w) of some other Spain run, but the bigger point I'm trying to get across is that with the personnel we have it is possible to run a system as long as we get everyone to buy in. It also feels like running this would get Adams a lot more involved in more than just rebounding which IMO is a good thing. Tbh, watching this it feels like Donovan does a lot of similar actions but the players don't really commit to running it (i.e don't screen hard or cut hard) but hopefully with more continuity with the roster we can have a fully formed offense and not just whatever the hell it is we do now. But the players have to buy in and Donovan has to commit to instilling it into them.  
  
For more, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrrxmZqhXDw&t=295s) the former Spain National Team explaining his style of play in full and [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIT5TmEmRlY) Spain in the 3rd place game at Eurobasket 2017 ~~(featuring our boy Alex ;)~~ he was injured for this game :().

There was a 'plan' involved in bringing him over--he was supposed to play a stretch 4. Problem was though he has little lateral quickness anymore, is exploited on defense by basically every team in the NBA, walks the court, and b/c he can't drive effectively--defenders play him tight on D which severely affects his jump shot percentage.

"It seems like the one place and contract we could get Melo outta here for. I feel like as much of a dickhead we all know Melo is, the Heat may at least feel he's a reclamation project and he gets into shape under their regime he can be effective. Plus, if he's ass it's a one year deal and allows them to clear cap for 2019 free agents (and we know getting big free agents is a big part of Miami's model).  
  
For us, it gets more complicated. The obvious problem is ""well we already have Adams"". But I think that for all the things Adams does well, we need a real rim protector because Adams just isn't that. And in the bigger picture, as much as I dislike Donovan as a coach, he loves two big line-ups (Horford and Noah, Kanter and Adams) and his best moments as coach involve two big line-ups (against the Spurs and Warriors). The problem with Kanter and Adams was that Kanter was just such a bad defender. But with Adams and Whiteside together we solve that problem. We wouldn't be able to run a ""modern"" NBA offense but we'd at least have an identity and work with what Billy seems to excel at. Instead of trying to copy trends, we could try to build our own style of basketball with just two twin towers, two great defensive wings in PG and Roberson and Russ as the athletic juggernaut.

*Oklahoma City Thunder Receive: Kevin Love*

Hornets would do this as it puts them in a position to start tanking, rather than being stuck in mediocrity, and gives them some nice young pieces and a second round pick.

Cavs would do this as it finally gives them a proper rim protecter and this will give them someone that can carry the offense over than LeBron in Kemba, which will put them in a much better position to contend if they keep LeBron.

OKC would do this because Kevin Love is simply just an improvement on Melo.

Knicks would do this as it will give Porzingis the All Star teammate he's been waiting for, and Dwight can compliment him very nicely, and can help Porzingis out with rebounds which he struggles with. Also if Dwight doesn't work out he's expiring anyway and you can let him walk and still have Kemba.

OKC would do this as it finally gives them a backup Center, who is on an expiring contract so him being overpaid doesn't matter, also Enes would probably re-sign for cheaper. And OKC basically get what Alex Abrines will probably end up being in Courtney Lee.

Phoenix would do this as Devin Booker has made it clear he wants to start winning right now, and surrounding him with Kemba and Dwight, alongside Jackson and whoever they pick in the draft, would definitely put them in a good position to do that.

"Now that the season is over, it is time to look to the future. The future hinges heavily upon what Paul George decides to do this summer.


Let’s say for the sake of argument he does not resign. That leaves OKC with a core of Russ, Roberson, Melo (more on him in a second), Adams and Grant. There are 2 paths OKC can take; play out next season as they wait  for Melo’s contract to expire, and probably get bounced in the first round of the playoffs; or try to trade Melo for better complementary pieces.  I think trading Melo without having to sacrifice an asset like Abrines or Ferguson is unlikely, so playing out the season with Melo on board is looking the more realistic outcome. In either scenario, OKC should be looking to devote greater minutes to Grant, Abrines, and Ferguson as they bridge the gap to the future.


Now let’s say Paul George does resign. That leaves OKC with the aforementioned core plus George. The next step is getting Melo to accept a bench role, which is better suited for his talents. If he will not accept such role, then the Thunder have to get him off the roster. 


Let’s say OKC does get Melo off the roster, whether it’s via trade, stretch provision, or a buy out. OKC would be putting out Russ-Roberson-PG-Grant-Adams, which has plenty of defensive capability stemming from the latter 4, while also packing a sizable offensive punch from Russ and PG. OKC can bring Abrines, Ferguson, Patterson, and (if he is resigned) Felton. This roster fits together much better, as the pieces complement each other much better than they did with Melo on the roster. Plus, this roster has greater financial flexibility, as it allows OKC to add role players if need be. ","The Way Forward Now that the season is over, it is time to look to the future. The future hinges heavily upon what Paul George decides to do this summer.


Let’s say for the sake of argument he does not resign. That leaves OKC with a core of Russ, Roberson, Melo (more on him in a second), Adams and Grant. There are 2 paths OKC can take; play out next season as they wait  for Melo’s contract to expire, and probably get bounced in the first round of the playoffs; or try to trade Melo for better complementary pieces.  I think trading Melo without having to sacrifice an asset like Abrines or Ferguson is unlikely, so playing out the season with Melo on board is looking the more realistic outcome. In either scenario, OKC should be looking to devote greater minutes to Grant, Abrines, and Ferguson as they bridge the gap to the future.

I decided to go back and look at Billy D’s first press conference when he was introduced as the new head coach. This line really stood out to me. For all the ppl that question him, obviously he had the right idea coming into the organization, but somewhere it became lost.

It sounds to me like he has probably been implementing this, but guys just aren’t doing it. I definitely agree with people that say Billy is partially to blame for being unable to take command of the locker room and have them buy into what he wants. Hopefully we get some accountability on both ends (players and coach) going into next season. Players are looking at film and I find it hard to believe that they can’t see the difference when the ball is moving around more. This is why I feel like it really is them slipping back into old habits and I feel like it starts with Russ making a conscious effort. I’m not bashing Russ, because I understand the position he’s in. However, it’s a trickle down effect. He makes that change then the entire team does as well. 

I really hope guys work on that going into next season. A team can’t win a championship in the current NBA climate if they’re not playing team basketball and implementing more ball/player movement. I think this takes a lot more work than we realize though. A team can’t wake up and decide they’ll implement this and have it click right away. There’s definitely a huge amount of chemistry, trust and practice needed to successfully execute this.

"I think the only way to trade Carmelo would be to swap bad contracts with another team. One that comes to mind right away is Chandler Parsons with the Grizzlies. Parsons will be getting paid 24M next year, a similar number to Carmelo's 28M. The Grizzlies could cover any remaining gap in salary by putting in players with non-guaranteed salary who would be waived after the trade is completed.

This would be a mutually beneficial trade, as the Thunder get reclamation project in Parsons (who shot 42% from 3 last year) and the Grizzlies only have to deal with Carmelo's contract for one year before it goes off the books, while injecting some talent into their roster. The caveat to all this is getting him to accept a trade, as he as a no trade clause in his contract. 

Another option to get rid of Carmelo would be applying the stretch provision, spreading the remaining 28M he is owed over the next 3 years. That would would limit OKC's flexibility to upgrade the roster in the coming years, but would save 19M this year, thereby lessening the blow of potentially maxing out George and resigning Grant.

"I have have seen many people on this sub state that they believe that Billy Donovan is actually a good coach. I am wondering by what metric that can that be true.

1\. Offense

Our offensive system is non-existent. We just run iso and pick and roll and pray that our stars make something happen. Outside of that, there is little to no motion in the 3-4 other player that are not the focus of that possession. We never generate easy looks.

2\. Defense

Our defensive system is stupid. We switch one everything, thus leaving mismatches all over the court. We, by design, often have Adams switch onto a guard on the perimeter. Sure, our defense was good before Roberson was injured, but how could a defense be bad with two of the best three perimeter defenders on your team? Billy incompetence on the defensive end were exposed when Roberson got injured.

3\. Adjustments

How many times did we get our butts kicked in the third quarter? How often did we just keep running iso after iso, switch after switch without trying anything different? Other teams adjust, we don't.

4\. Rotations

Billy's rotations have been criticized all throughout his tenure as Head Coach. This has been defended as experiments for use in the playoffs, but, outside of one series against the Spurs two years ago, these ""experimental rotations"" have never borne fruit. Furthermore, obvious rotation such as PPat or Grant for Melo in the starting lineup were never attempted. This leads us to our next point...

5\. Accountability

There is no accountability on this team. Melo played like a corpse all year, but Billy never benched him. When Westbrook plays like out-of-control-brook, Billy never benches him. Billy has no control over this team, he's just a doormat to our stars. Until we get a coach that isn't a glorified yes-man, we will never take the next step.

Will keep updated as we go:

Sam opening comments :

* Sam is being really open and honest to start. Said he thinks we were just too inconsistent and think that caught up with us. Saying he hopes to keep much of the same core. Doesn't blame Billy at all because we've had 3 different teams the last 3 years.

* Sam is doing a lot of talking about Russ/PG. We're about 10 minutes in and no mention of Melo. He went on a little schpeel about Paul and talked about Russ + PG duo.

* Talking about Melo now separately. Said he's been a total pro and didn't want us to take his comments out of context and think he's been terrible. He was in it and committed. Says they'll talk more later. Interesting!

* Sam keeps talking about he wants to have the core come back. He referred to the core as Russ/PG/Steven. Very interesting!!

* He sounds very positive. Wants to see more out of 2Pat. Thinks Abrines and Jerami are good and thinks continuity is our best friend. Not happy where we're at but he's optimistic. 

Now taking questions:

* Someone asking why is Billy the one? Says he ticks off 3 things -- basketball coach that can adapt to a changing game with changing personnel -- Again says Billy needs continuity. Coach that can align itself with organizational culture. And third a coach that is basically just a good dude. Presti feels confident with Billy. Giving some pointers throughout his tenure as to why -- pointing at being 4 minutes away from WCF his first year mainly. 

* Billy is absolutely coming back. Someone asked right out.

* Plan B if Paul leaves? He is saying human beings are different (assuming he's talking about KD). No clue what Sam is blabbering about but he's saying we have to wait and see what Paul does. Convos with Paul thus far have been transparent and honest. Sam believes in people and wants to let the process play out to make a decision. Says they are prepared for all the different directions.  Going into how they built the team on the fly after Russ signed for 5 years and how he wanted to align a team with Russ' best years. Now believes the goal is to create a team that works for Paul/Russ/Steven's primes right now. Thinks we're in a good position if PG does not return -- likes his surrounding cast. 

* A question about Melo ( I didn't hear the question). Something along the lines of did Melo not enjoy himself. Sam is saying Melo basically has to decide if Melo doesn't want to play the role (so it sounds like we aren't going to fit him in more). Melo was open about his thoughts and we'll have to be honest back with him. Sam understands why he was frustrated. Sam promises the method if this takes time with the different convos (gotta be straight and honest) -- if he does want to come back, we all need to be on the same page. Says Melo was great for us this year (rattles off some numbers -- best starting lineup in the league). Sam sounds like he wants to see who comes back first beforehand.

* Asking about Melo's money now if he opts in. Sam says the dialgue has to happen about what Melo sees for his career and what he wants out of it. Thinks before we get to finance we have to get to the dialogue and open communication first. A lot goes into it -- lots of questions, talking to agents, lots of listening, etc. Believes they can sort it out and figure it out.

* How's Andre and what do we expect when he returns? It's a tedious rehab and it's a long rehab. Says it's important not to make Dre going down a thing -- thinks we should have adapted better to Dre being out. Likes Dre because he's competitive and does the stuff a lot of people want to do. Rattling off more numbers (Dre shot 55%) -- said he played really well. Says in our 20 or so close games, we really struggled in close games -- says we fouled way too much in close games and people shot the ball really well against us -- and says Dre makes a difference in those situations. Thinks he and Paul together are a problem (defensively) -- likes that duo. Says we didn't adjust well enough to his injury

* Question about trading for Paul (can't hear it-- they dont have a mic on the dudes) I think this is a question of finances. Sam says the only way the Thunder become a really expensive team is if Paul stays. Sam says they absolutely will be willing to pay that price. Says we have to look at in a 10 year span, not just year by yea. Talking about wins per contract, efficiency of winning vs cap used, we're top 3 in that 10 year period of time. We're middle of the league in our entire 10 years for how much we've spent. Had to extend Westbrook in his prime -- says the cost was worth it. Basically, saying spending all this money is not something we've always done but we want to keep Paul George. 

* More questions about finances and is it worth it for this team? Says he thinks we'll be a better team next year and rattles off numbers about how this team is better than last years. Doesn't think it's a tough decision to sign Paul.

* How pivotal is Russ' leadership? Can Russ still improve? How do you want he and PG to work if he stays? -- Sam says Westbrook is driven and he's going to keep coming. He's not going to kick his feet up and expect to comeback next year and expect things to be different. Thinks he's going to spend a lot of time thinking about things to get better. Sam says Russ wants to be a better 3pt shooter. Russ works on this late at night. Big part of his evolution. Sam says he's one of the best players in the league but Russ knows how to improve. Thinks we have to put him in those positions to enhance his effectiveness. 2nd most total wins in the last 10 years. And Russ has been there for all of it. FT shooting was bad but we still ended up 7th in offensive efficiency. Gotta find out why we weren't shooting that well this season. Rattling off more numbers (this dude knows his shit lol). Sam wants to take this into consideration and thinks we have to put everyone in better positions to succeed.

* he's going on a small rant about the free throw line. gotta shoot better.

* Russ q - how do we get more out of him defensively? Sam thinks we were 1 or 2 with Dre, thinks we can get more out of the everyone as we ended 9 defensively. Westbrook, PG, Dre, Adams and Melo were good -- when Dre went out, everyone struggled, not just Russ. Defense is not glamorous. The best defenses force the most inefficient shots. We turned people over but we didnt force into bad shots.Says knew that would be an issue because they tried to add more shooting this year (regarding rebounding). Again talks about continuity -- if we're able to bring the same group back, anticipation (with switching) and role definition will be better. The best defensive teams have continuity. Cerebral nature to defense. Want to be better than top 10, wants to be top 5.

* How did you feel about Vic and Sab? Sam wasn't surprised. Said OKC gave Victor that contract and we traded a good player to get Sabonis. Thinks it shouldn't be a reflection on us -- we needed to be closer to our goal. We were a 0 net rating team -- those guys were basically a bad fit for us and thinks they should stay in Indiana lol. Says he's really happy for those guys. Sam is saying the point of the business is to have a good feel on players. The fit for Vic is better in Indiana. Vic and Sab are great competitiors. Talking about Taj -- he was great in OKC but he works with Thibs. We want our old guys to do really well. We're really happy with the position we're in (were a +3 net rating team now).

* How do we sell PG on OKC/Russ and was the trade worth it? - We weren't going to have access to a guy like PAul without making the trade. Talking about building a team that works on a timeline with Russ mainly and Steven as well. Wouldn't be able to get a guy of PGs caliber without the trade. The foundation in year 1 is certainly optimistic. We get to build a relationship with him and such. Example -- you get an hour long FA meeting, but with the trade we get to show PG the best stuff about the organization and Oklahoma. Says it's nice to show that to a FA. Thinks the adversity was good because we had to just show Paul the real us. Everyone kept working and plucking. Everyone was working together -- said PG was a huge part of that. Said he was interacting and stuff. Said the dialogue between those guys was strong and that kind of stuff helps show PG who we are. 

* Jerami -- how do you feel about making JG restricted or UFA? Sam can't say much -- says 2 people have to cooperate with an extension (talking about last year). Said he didn't know what was coming at us. Says we thought Melo could be a stretch player but Enes and Doug were situational players so that was a fine trade to make financially. Knew we'd check in pretty high money wise -- could have been prevented but can still use JGs bird rights. Plans to have those convos. Excited about his development but gotta see what the market is.

* What objections do you hear about trading/getting players to come to OKC. Said there are no real objections right now. I think this is in reference to what he said about PG and saying we don't have an option to get players like that here. Is clarifying and you tend to draft guys as good as PG/Russ/KD. Have to add those pieces based on the timeline and have to trade good players to get good players. Said we're still working off something from 2008 (that time line?). PG was the best way to continue on that track from 2008. Thinks at some point yes we'll have to rebuild but we want to keep an elite team on the floor as long as possible. 

* Melo staying have anything to do with PG? Sam doesn't know. Thinks the guys have a really nice chemistry/bond. Doesn't want to oversell them as a group, but thinks in Melo's case he is just being honest about whether he feels like he can commit another year to playing this role. Appreciates Melo's candor. Otherwise, doesn't know what effect Melo's bond with PG will have on his next year. Sam again likes the foundation we have on a human level -- thinks the entire group is really connected. GOtta get stronger in the consistent areas. Gonna do what OKC does -- take where we are and compete and keep coming and keep our eye on the ball and figure out how to get better. Wants to get to another level. EVeryone has to want that.

* PG gone article? Sam says he talked to PG. Sam says PG likes to keep his business pretty in house. PG has been really straight down the middle. Sam cant do anything but trust the things he's been told. PG has said nice things about the org. Can't be cynical about any of this.

* Sam left but I think someone asked a question about Enes as he was leaving. Maybe it wasn't Enes? I can't tell. They're away from the mics. Oh I think he's talking about Felton? I can't tell sorry.  Sam is really still saying this group is really very connected and we handled defeat and victory really well. Said it was fascinating watching Ray connect with everyone. EDIT: The question was about getting Felton to come back. Sam basically said he really liked this group and he can't say whether he wants Ray to come back. Convo to have. Said Ray was good with connecting everyone.

* Fred I think asked a fun question about how did you like the local reporting lol. Sam said it was great. 

--Woo! fun times.

My personal summary:

Sam knows his shit and he made me feel a lot better about keeping Billy around. There were numbers Sam just rattled off that showed an obvious improvement from last year to this year. This is absolutely Russ' team and he wants to build a team that goes along with Russ' prime. Thinks PG fits with that very well and Adams and Dre are really good. It didn't sound like he was very confident with Melo staying. Other than being asked about Carmelo, he didn't talk about him much. Russ/Adams/PG/Dre were the main guys and it seems like Sam really wants those guys but he sounds like he has some ideas if PG does go. 

Same really has a point with the continuity thing and I'd be willing to watch this team again with a better role for Carmelo. It sounds like they aren't going to budget with Carmelo. Now, idk if Billy want him off the bench but they definitely want him to be a catch and shoot guy. 

July is gonna be hella interesting!!","Sam Presti Conference Updates VIDEO LINK: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJxVlmgYj8c

Will keep updated as we go:

Sam opening comments :

* Sam is being really open and honest to start. Said he thinks we were just too inconsistent and think that caught up with us. Saying he hopes to keep much of the same core. Doesn't blame Billy at all because we've had 3 different teams the last 3 years.

* Sam is doing a lot of talking about Russ/PG. We're about 10 minutes in and no mention of Melo. He went on a little schpeel about Paul and talked about Russ + PG duo.

* Talking about Melo now separately. Said he's been a total pro and didn't want us to take his comments out of context and think he's been terrible. He was in it and committed. Says they'll talk more later. Interesting!

* Sam keeps talking about he wants to have the core come back. He referred to the core as Russ/PG/Steven. Very interesting!!

* He sounds very positive. Wants to see more out of 2Pat. Thinks Abrines and Jerami are good and thinks continuity is our best friend. Not happy where we're at but he's optimistic. 

Now taking questions:

* Someone asking why is Billy the one? Says he ticks off 3 things -- basketball coach that can adapt to a changing game with changing personnel -- Again says Billy needs continuity. Coach that can align itself with organizational culture. And third a coach that is basically just a good dude. Presti feels confident with Billy. Giving some pointers throughout his tenure as to why -- pointing at being 4 minutes away from WCF his first year mainly. 

* Billy is absolutely coming back. Someone asked right out.

* Plan B if Paul leaves? He is saying human beings are different (assuming he's talking about KD). No clue what Sam is blabbering about but he's saying we have to wait and see what Paul does. Convos with Paul thus far have been transparent and honest. Sam believes in people and wants to let the process play out to make a decision. Says they are prepared for all the different directions.  Going into how they built the team on the fly after Russ signed for 5 years and how he wanted to align a team with Russ' best years. Now believes the goal is to create a team that works for Paul/Russ/Steven's primes right now. Thinks we're in a good position if PG does not return -- likes his surrounding cast. 

* A question about Melo ( I didn't hear the question). Something along the lines of did Melo not enjoy himself. Sam is saying Melo basically has to decide if Melo doesn't want to play the role (so it sounds like we aren't going to fit him in more). Melo was open about his thoughts and we'll have to be honest back with him. Sam understands why he was frustrated. Sam promises the method if this takes time with the different convos (gotta be straight and honest) -- if he does want to come back, we all need to be on the same page. Says Melo was great for us this year (rattles off some numbers -- best starting lineup in the league). Sam sounds like he wants to see who comes back first beforehand.

* Asking about Melo's money now if he opts in. Sam says the dialgue has to happen about what Melo sees for his career and what he wants out of it. Thinks before we get to finance we have to get to the dialogue and open communication first. A lot goes into it -- lots of questions, talking to agents, lots of listening, etc. Believes they can sort it out and figure it out.

* How's Andre and what do we expect when he returns? It's a tedious rehab and it's a long rehab. Says it's important not to make Dre going down a thing -- thinks we should have adapted better to Dre being out. Likes Dre because he's competitive and does the stuff a lot of people want to do. Rattling off more numbers (Dre shot 55%) -- said he played really well. Says in our 20 or so close games, we really struggled in close games -- says we fouled way too much in close games and people shot the ball really well against us -- and says Dre makes a difference in those situations. Thinks he and Paul together are a problem (defensively) -- likes that duo. Says we didn't adjust well enough to his injury

* Question about trading for Paul (can't hear it-- they dont have a mic on the dudes) I think this is a question of finances. Sam says the only way the Thunder become a really expensive team is if Paul stays. Sam says they absolutely will be willing to pay that price. Says we have to look at in a 10 year span, not just year by yea. Talking about wins per contract, efficiency of winning vs cap used, we're top 3 in that 10 year period of time. We're middle of the league in our entire 10 years for how much we've spent. Had to extend Westbrook in his prime -- says the cost was worth it. Basically, saying spending all this money is not something we've always done but we want to keep Paul George. 

* More questions about finances and is it worth it for this team? Says he thinks we'll be a better team next year and rattles off numbers about how this team is better than last years. Doesn't think it's a tough decision to sign Paul.

* How pivotal is Russ' leadership? Can Russ still improve? How do you want he and PG to work if he stays? -- Sam says Westbrook is driven and he's going to keep coming. He's not going to kick his feet up and expect to comeback next year and expect things to be different. Thinks he's going to spend a lot of time thinking about things to get better. Sam says Russ wants to be a better 3pt shooter. Russ works on this late at night. Big part of his evolution. Sam says he's one of the best players in the league but Russ knows how to improve. Thinks we have to put him in those positions to enhance his effectiveness. 2nd most total wins in the last 10 years. And Russ has been there for all of it. FT shooting was bad but we still ended up 7th in offensive efficiency. Gotta find out why we weren't shooting that well this season. Rattling off more numbers (this dude knows his shit lol). Sam wants to take this into consideration and thinks we have to put everyone in better positions to succeed.

* he's going on a small rant about the free throw line. gotta shoot better.

* Russ q - how do we get more out of him defensively? Sam thinks we were 1 or 2 with Dre, thinks we can get more out of the everyone as we ended 9 defensively. Westbrook, PG, Dre, Adams and Melo were good -- when Dre went out, everyone struggled, not just Russ. Defense is not glamorous. The best defenses force the most inefficient shots. We turned people over but we didnt force into bad shots.Says knew that would be an issue because they tried to add more shooting this year (regarding rebounding). Again talks about continuity -- if we're able to bring the same group back, anticipation (with switching) and role definition will be better. The best defensive teams have continuity. Cerebral nature to defense. Want to be better than top 10, wants to be top 5.

* How did you feel about Vic and Sab? Sam wasn't surprised. Said OKC gave Victor that contract and we traded a good player to get Sabonis. Thinks it shouldn't be a reflection on us -- we needed to be closer to our goal. We were a 0 net rating team -- those guys were basically a bad fit for us and thinks they should stay in Indiana lol. Says he's really happy for those guys. Sam is saying the point of the business is to have a good feel on players. The fit for Vic is better in Indiana. Vic and Sab are great competitiors. Talking about Taj -- he was great in OKC but he works with Thibs. We want our old guys to do really well. We're really happy with the position we're in (were a +3 net rating team now).

* How do we sell PG on OKC/Russ and was the trade worth it? - We weren't going to have access to a guy like PAul without making the trade. Talking about building a team that works on a timeline with Russ mainly and Steven as well. Wouldn't be able to get a guy of PGs caliber without the trade. The foundation in year 1 is certainly optimistic. We get to build a relationship with him and such. Example -- you get an hour long FA meeting, but with the trade we get to show PG the best stuff about the organization and Oklahoma. Says it's nice to show that to a FA. Thinks the adversity was good because we had to just show Paul the real us. Everyone kept working and plucking. Everyone was working together -- said PG was a huge part of that. Said he was interacting and stuff. Said the dialogue between those guys was strong and that kind of stuff helps show PG who we are. 

* Jerami -- how do you feel about making JG restricted or UFA? Sam can't say much -- says 2 people have to cooperate with an extension (talking about last year). Said he didn't know what was coming at us. Says we thought Melo could be a stretch player but Enes and Doug were situational players so that was a fine trade to make financially. Knew we'd check in pretty high money wise -- could have been prevented but can still use JGs bird rights. Plans to have those convos. Excited about his development but gotta see what the market is.

* What objections do you hear about trading/getting players to come to OKC. Said there are no real objections right now. I think this is in reference to what he said about PG and saying we don't have an option to get players like that here. Is clarifying and you tend to draft guys as good as PG/Russ/KD. Have to add those pieces based on the timeline and have to trade good players to get good players. Said we're still working off something from 2008 (that time line?). PG was the best way to continue on that track from 2008. Thinks at some point yes we'll have to rebuild but we want to keep an elite team on the floor as long as possible. 

* Melo staying have anything to do with PG? Sam doesn't know. Thinks the guys have a really nice chemistry/bond. Doesn't want to oversell them as a group, but thinks in Melo's case he is just being honest about whether he feels like he can commit another year to playing this role. Appreciates Melo's candor. Otherwise, doesn't know what effect Melo's bond with PG will have on his next year. Sam again likes the foundation we have on a human level -- thinks the entire group is really connected. GOtta get stronger in the consistent areas. Gonna do what OKC does -- take where we are and compete and keep coming and keep our eye on the ball and figure out how to get better. Wants to get to another level. EVeryone has to want that.

* PG gone article? Sam says he talked to PG. Sam says PG likes to keep his business pretty in house. PG has been really straight down the middle. Sam cant do anything but trust the things he's been told. PG has said nice things about the org. Can't be cynical about any of this.

* Sam left but I think someone asked a question about Enes as he was leaving. Maybe it wasn't Enes? I can't tell. They're away from the mics. Oh I think he's talking about Felton? I can't tell sorry.  Sam is really still saying this group is really very connected and we handled defeat and victory really well. Said it was fascinating watching Ray connect with everyone. EDIT: The question was about getting Felton to come back. Sam basically said he really liked this group and he can't say whether he wants Ray to come back. Convo to have. Said Ray was good with connecting everyone.

* Fred I think asked a fun question about how did you like the local reporting lol. Sam said it was great.

Some interesting things here, especially after the Zach Lowe article. Russillo is saying some of the same stuff but, he really *Really* doesn't like Russ and is blaming him for a lot.

Now I'm a huge Russ fan and after watching this season and last season, I have started to ask some questions. Because it's very obvious we need a system and why aren't we running one?

Anywho...Russillo talks about some things. SOme interesting points

* The organization loves Russ but basically feel like he's on a one man wrecking crew kind of mission and they don't really know how to handle this. They want to be better and do right but Russ basically wants to do what he wants.

* Russillo and his sources believe this is because Russ had early success in his career and just doesn't want to conform. Me personally, idk about this because I feel like he's changed. But he made a point about Game 5 and Game 6 -- He thinks Russ thought he could replicate Game 5 whenever he wanted and thus chucked up 17 3s in Game 6. Blames 5 points from PG on Russ.

* He does have a source that says he believes PG is gone. This was in no way concrete (so don't believe the hype on r/nba front page).  The other dude says Royce Young said otherwise and Russillo changed his tone -- said if Royce believes it then he believes Royce but basically that was all inconclusive.

* Believes Russ needs to get a team built around him like Harden/Lebron have. Role players and shooters and Russ is the undeniable guy. (I tend to agree with this as well). He says PG not staying is not a bad thing, especially if they can make this happen but there aren't really any more good 3&D players out there.

Then he got tired of talking about OKC lol.

"I am so tired of the media & people on social network blaming our failures on Russell Westbrook. There's not a player in this league that plays with as much heart as he does. He gives it his all every night. He's the kind of player that sport fans deserve. 

Over the years we've heard the following:

- He's a stat padder
- He's a ball hog
- He will never win a ring
- He's arrogant
 .. & more

I find it so disrespectful. Russell Westbrook isn't perfect by any means. We know that, the critics know that & more importantly, Westbrook knows that. That's why every year, he does his best to improve his game. 

People claim they always root for the underdog, is Westbrook not an underdog? He wasn't highly recruited out of high school. He was Darren Collison's backup in college. He worked hard to get where he's at. So for people to try to trash him, it's ridiculous! How can you doubt a guy that puts in so much work? More work then most critics ever put in in their lives.

Recently I saw this post about players doing better after they leave OKC. If I can remember correctly, I believe the list was: Kevin Durant, James Harden, Victor Oladipo, Serge Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, Domantis Sabonis, Enes Kanter & Dion Waiters. They're saying Westbrook held all of those players back. 

- Kevin Durant held himself back. He averaged more shots than Westbrook. He didn't play with any aggression. He didn't start doing that tough guy act until he went to GS. He was just as responsible for us blowing a 3-1 lead. Its easy to say he is doing better. He went on to win a ring with a team that went 73-9 the year before he got there. Yep, sure was Westbrook holding him back /s. 

- OKC's James Harden wasn't the same player as HOU's James Harden. Harden came off the bench for OKC. He wasn't getting as many fouls called for him either. Hell his percentages got worst since he left OKC. People like to blame Presti & the owners for not paying Harden the extra $3m, how about we flip that? He loved it here so much, why not take $3m less to stay? 

- Victor Oladipo was horrible with the Magic. Go look on espn.com & check out his numbers for yourself. He actually did better with OKC. Once he got traded to the Pacers, he became THE guy there. His numbers only improved slightly. Also he is in much better shape. He blamed his shooting woes on a wrist injury.

- Enes Kanter was on the bench for us. He started every game he played in for the Knicks. The only thing that improved was his rebounding. 

- Serge Ibaka has been on a decline since 15'. No need to even get into it.  Reggie Jackson was our BACKUP PG. He got traded to the Pistons because he wanted to start & get paid top dollar. Is he actually more successful? Hell no. Domantas Sabonis is being used the right way in Indiana. For some reason we had him shootin 3s. But, you would expect a player to get better after their rookie year. Dion Waiters was also THE guy for Miami before he got injured. 

So how does this have anything to do with Westbrook? It doesn't. If anything, people should look at the coaching staff. 

Westbrook doing something that hasn't been done in over 50 years makes him a stat padder. Averaging a triple double. Does that make Oscar Robertson a stat padder as well? He was the only player to ever do it before Westbrook did it. How do you stat pad assists? How do you stat pad rebounds? If it were that easy .. why don't other players do it? Did people call James Harden a stat padder when he was getting all those crazy stat lines? Also .. How can you be considered a ball hog & lead the league in assists? 

Supposedly people don't wanna play with Westbrook. Every former OKC player with the exception of Kevin Durant said nothing but great things about him. I'm gonna bring in 2 more players into this equation.

People have been saying OKC should get a pass first point guard & move Westbrook to SG. I don't understand why. ""He doesn't make his teammates better."" He's the PG & the star of this team. Truthfully, if he didn't take most of the shots he took, we would've lost a lot more games. But let me get to these other 2 players.

Steph Curry & Lebron James. 

Curry is GSW's Point Guard. What is he known for? Not making his teammates better. No, he's known for shooting 3 pointers. How about this .. Draymond Green, Yes GSW's POWER FORWARD, has averaged more assists than Curry for the last 3 seasons. We don't see no articles talking about Curry's inability to make his teammates better. I get it, they won a couple rings. They also happened to have perhaps the most stacked team in the league. 

Lebron James (King James) is known as 1 of the best basketball players ever.  They compare him to Jordan & Kobe. They say he makes his team better. Let's think of the stars he's had. Wade, Bosh, Love & Irving. Every last 1 of these players dropped like 10 ppg. How is that making them better? Most of their shooting %'s dropped or stayed the same.

It's confusing to me. Then you got all the bandwagon fans. ""I've been a Warriors fan since ..."" - ""Oh I've been a Rockets fan!"" - ""Cavs Nation!""

What ever happened to all those Laker fans? Heat fans? Celtics fans? Mavs fans? What happened to all of them? Let's not end up like them.

Russell Westbrook is by far my favorite player. He's the most entertaining player in the league to me. All the disrespect he's getting is uncalled for. It's coming from ignorant people or media members trying to make their show relevant. (I'm looking at you Colin Cowherd.) This team obviously needs to make some changes. I think we need to be more adventurous when it comes to coaches. Scott Brooks & Billy Donovan weren't the answers. They may be great guys but they aren't great coaches. We need a new coach & we need Sam Presti to get players that can score. All the defensive stops mean nothing if we cant score.

","Russell Westbrook (very long post) I am so tired of the media & people on social network blaming our failures on Russell Westbrook. There's not a player in this league that plays with as much heart as he does. He gives it his all every night. He's the kind of player that sport fans deserve. 

Over the years we've heard the following:

- He's a stat padder
- He's a ball hog
- He will never win a ring
- He's arrogant
 .. & more

I find it so disrespectful. Russell Westbrook isn't perfect by any means. We know that, the critics know that & more importantly, Westbrook knows that. That's why every year, he does his best to improve his game. 

People claim they always root for the underdog, is Westbrook not an underdog? He wasn't highly recruited out of high school. He was Darren Collison's backup in college. He worked hard to get where he's at. So for people to try to trash him, it's ridiculous! How can you doubt a guy that puts in so much work? More work then most critics ever put in in their lives.

Recently I saw this post about players doing better after they leave OKC. If I can remember correctly, I believe the list was: Kevin Durant, James Harden, Victor Oladipo, Serge Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, Domantis Sabonis, Enes Kanter & Dion Waiters. They're saying Westbrook held all of those players back. 

- Kevin Durant held himself back. He averaged more shots than Westbrook. He didn't play with any aggression. He didn't start doing that tough guy act until he went to GS. He was just as responsible for us blowing a 3-1 lead. Its easy to say he is doing better. He went on to win a ring with a team that went 73-9 the year before he got there. Yep, sure was Westbrook holding him back /s. 

- OKC's James Harden wasn't the same player as HOU's James Harden. Harden came off the bench for OKC. He wasn't getting as many fouls called for him either. Hell his percentages got worst since he left OKC. People like to blame Presti & the owners for not paying Harden the extra $3m, how about we flip that? He loved it here so much, why not take $3m less to stay? 

- Victor Oladipo was horrible with the Magic. Go look on espn.com & check out his numbers for yourself. He actually did better with OKC. Once he got traded to the Pacers, he became THE guy there. His numbers only improved slightly. Also he is in much better shape. He blamed his shooting woes on a wrist injury.

- Enes Kanter was on the bench for us. He started every game he played in for the Knicks. The only thing that improved was his rebounding. 

- Serge Ibaka has been on a decline since 15'. No need to even get into it.  Reggie Jackson was our BACKUP PG. He got traded to the Pistons because he wanted to start & get paid top dollar. Is he actually more successful? Hell no. Domantas Sabonis is being used the right way in Indiana. For some reason we had him shootin 3s. But, you would expect a player to get better after their rookie year. Dion Waiters was also THE guy for Miami before he got injured. 

So how does this have anything to do with Westbrook? It doesn't. If anything, people should look at the coaching staff. 

Westbrook doing something that hasn't been done in over 50 years makes him a stat padder. Averaging a triple double. Does that make Oscar Robertson a stat padder as well? He was the only player to ever do it before Westbrook did it. How do you stat pad assists? How do you stat pad rebounds? If it were that easy .. why don't other players do it? Did people call James Harden a stat padder when he was getting all those crazy stat lines? Also .. How can you be considered a ball hog & lead the league in assists? 

Supposedly people don't wanna play with Westbrook. Every former OKC player with the exception of Kevin Durant said nothing but great things about him. I'm gonna bring in 2 more players into this equation.

People have been saying OKC should get a pass first point guard & move Westbrook to SG. I don't understand why. ""He doesn't make his teammates better."" He's the PG & the star of this team. Truthfully, if he didn't take most of the shots he took, we would've lost a lot more games. But let me get to these other 2 players.

Steph Curry & Lebron James. 

Curry is GSW's Point Guard. What is he known for? Not making his teammates better. No, he's known for shooting 3 pointers. How about this .. Draymond Green, Yes GSW's POWER FORWARD, has averaged more assists than Curry for the last 3 seasons. We don't see no articles talking about Curry's inability to make his teammates better. I get it, they won a couple rings. They also happened to have perhaps the most stacked team in the league. 

Lebron James (King James) is known as 1 of the best basketball players ever.  They compare him to Jordan & Kobe. They say he makes his team better. Let's think of the stars he's had. Wade, Bosh, Love & Irving. Every last 1 of these players dropped like 10 ppg. How is that making them better? Most of their shooting %'s dropped or stayed the same.

It's confusing to me. Then you got all the bandwagon fans. ""I've been a Warriors fan since ..."" - ""Oh I've been a Rockets fan!"" - ""Cavs Nation!""

What ever happened to all those Laker fans? Heat fans? Celtics fans? Mavs fans? What happened to all of them? Let's not end up like them.

Russell Westbrook is by far my favorite player. He's the most entertaining player in the league to me. All the disrespect he's getting is uncalled for.

Notable quotes
>Regardless, the Thunder never provided Westbrook the personnel to go all-in on a spread pick-and-roll. In the draft, they erred toward defense, athleticism, and length, figuring they could turn college power forwards into wings and teach them to shoot. They have almost always had one nonthreatening shooter-- Roberson, Jerami Grant, Thabo Sefolosha, others -- mucking up driving lanes.

>They took a shot on Dion Waiters becoming the dream 3-and-D player. None of their bets beyond Adams since the 2012 Harden trade -- from which they are still recovering -- hit big.

>Oklahoma City's failure to develop an offensive system goes beyond Westbrook. But we have been talking about this problem for almost 10 years. The coach has changed, the bench has changed, the stars around him have changed.

>Westbrook's heart is in the right place; he wants to win, and when he takes a lot of shots, it is because he has concluded that is the best path to winning. More than one person described Westbrook's process as doing math while scanning the floor: he knows he can hit X percentage from this spot. A teammate can only do better if they are in the right spot, in rhythm, in the middle of a good game. Passing brings the risk of a turnover -- lowering the expected points per possession. There is a method.

>And for two straight years post-Durant, Oklahoma City's offense disintegrated with Westbrook on the bench. George couldn't reverse that trend. It says a lot about Westbrook's greatness, and the Thunder's shaky bench. It also stems from the Thunder's style: When one person is the system, the whole thing collapses when that person rests.

"Warning Short slightly drunken rant 

I think we can all say the season has been disappointing to say the very least,  and though I'm sure you've all heard this before, Billy D needs to be let go. To say the offense sucks is a major understatement,  but the defense (which BD is known for) is picked apart by multiple teams and seems to only work for some teams(GS) yet our coach makes no adjustment. 

A million things didn't go right starting with a major piece in Dre going down who held our entire defensive scheme together,  PG being inconsistent as usual,  Melo aging and definitely not working as a catch and shoot player or a ""we can't find a shot so here jab step for 15 secs"" player,  Westbrook not being able to check himself at moments, bench being atrocious at times,  overvaluing Tferg,  etc etc etc. 

But our hardest hit to our season was NO ADJUSTMENTS,  none at all.  And we suffered from an all ISO offence, gave the wrong guys minutes, and sent out horrid lineup after lineup every game. We switched every game and relied heavily on talent alone to drag us to the fourth seed. And if I hear BD say we played great but just couldn't hit shots I'll rip my hair out.  

Sadly just like his bestie BD,  presti will make no adjustments to the coaching staff and give him yet another chance when he should've been out in December.  It's sad that we're wasting WBs prime and PG is most likely gone  and if Melo leaves and becomes better in an actual offensive system they'll blame Russ and it'll suck ass and we'll have to deal with even more triple double jokes.  This is all eye test from watching every game of the season and I'm more than slightly drunk now, but duck BD.

"Don't know if somebody had brought this up, but I really think Melo being used the way he was this season is a waste. Melo is good. He's dropped 60 in Madison square garden. However his play style has always been with the team playing around him. This is Russ' team there's no denying and I think that's good. But maybe sometimes itd be better to let Melo try and go throwback and take over the game. Just because it's Russ' team doesn't mean he has to run the ball every offense. 

For instance take LeBron. There are Cavs possessions where he literally just stands back and lets the other 4 move the ball, because somebody always has to be on him. He doesn't do it all the time obviously, but it's just another addition to the playbook.

Melo is good. He's dropped 60 in Madison square garden. However his play style has always been with the team playing around him. This is Russ' team there's no denying and I think that's good. But maybe sometimes itd be better to let Melo try and go throwback and take over the game. Just because it's Russ' team doesn't mean he has to run the ball every offense. 

For instance take LeBron. There are Cavs possessions where he literally just stands back and lets the other 4 move the ball, because somebody always has to be on him. He doesn't do it all the time obviously, but it's just another addition to the playbook.

"Hi Guys,

After enduring the season and watching the first lot of exit interviews, it got me thinking about the salary cap implications for next season. Obviously this season was disappointing, so it got me thinking whether the ownership would be willing to ""roll it back again"", considering the massive tax implications. Obviously OKC is a small market, so the owners probably can't afford to just bring everyone back. The Salary Cap is projected to be $101M next year, and the Luxury Tax Line is projected to be $123M. With that information in mind lets take a look at the salary's we have on the books for next year:

**Guaranteed 2018/19 Contracts:**

Russell Westbrook	  $35,350,000   
Carmelo Anthony	  $27,928,140   
Steven Adams	          $24,157,304   
Andre Roberson	          $10,000,000   
Alex Abrines	          $5,455,236   
Patrick Patterson	  $5,451,600   
Kyle Singler	          $4,996,000   
Terrance Ferguson	  $2,118,840   
Dakari Johnson	          $1,378,242   	
Total:                          $116,835,362   

**Potential Additional Contracts:**    
Paul George:               $30,300,000 (His max/30% of salary cap)   
Jerami Grant:              $8,568,000 (The projected non-tax payer mid level; probably what some teams may offer him)   
3 Minimum Contracts   $4,499,094 (3 x $1,499,698 contracts)    

**2018/19 Salary Cap Hit If Everyone Re-signs/Stays**   
**Player Contracts:**           $160,202,456 (if PG and Grant re-signs and Presti adds 3 players on minimum contracts)     
**Luxury Tax Payments:**    $157,515,350   
**Total Payments:**	           $317,717,806   

Obviously us fans aren't paying the tax and it would be great if the owners just paid whatever to keep PG and Grant, but that isn't realistic. Ownership obviously would not let Presti go that deep into the Luxury Tax. 

Presti could use the stretch provision on Melo and Singler and let Grant walk. Assuming Presti did this, and added 3 more minimum contracts in their place, the total numbers would be:   
**2018/19 Salary Cap Hit If Melo & Singler Get Stretched; Grant Leaves**      
**Total contracts:**                  $134,184,123   
**Luxury Tax Payments:**	       $30,394,432   
**Total Payments:**	               $164,578,555   

Obviously, there are a million things that the front office and ownership will explore, but I think it is pretty clear, that if PG re-signs; Melo will have to be stretched (assuming he's going to opt in to his $28M salary; which he would be stupid to opt out of). This would then hamper OKC's abilities over the next 3 seasons to make moves as they would still be paying 1/3 of his salary over each of the next 3 years.   

Sorry for the long spiel, just thought I'd crunch some numbers for some of the fans that may not fully understand the salary cap implications. I am by no means a salary cap expert, so sorry if I got anything wrong :).

"During last years Playoffs LaMarcus Aldridge played terribly on offense, to the point where he was even publicly called out by Pop to do more to help the team. As we all know he requested a trade during the Summer, and he and Pop sat down and agreed to shift the way he plays in the offense, and he just finished a fantastic year basically carrying the Spurs on offense all year.

Now I know Melo isn't as good as LMA, but both are volume, rhythm scorers who need to get multiple touches and shots to contribute consistently on offense. If they don't touch the ball for long periods of time they're more likely to miss.

If PG leaves Melo would naturally get more touches and be the clear 2nd option on the team with a more defined role.

"As many of you may know, Oklahoma has set a new record for latest tornado touchdown in recorded history for 2018. Looking at long range convective outlooks I'd like to start a dialogue on the likelihood of severe weather breaking out across the southern plains by mid week.


On Wednesday/D4, an upper trough will progress across the Four Corners states, with a belt of 60-70 kt midlevel flow and cooling aloft spreading into the southern and central Plains during the day. Meanwhile, low pressure will deepen over southeast CO, with a dryline from southwest KS across western OK and into northwest TX. To the north, a quasi-stationary front will extend from central KS into central IA and southern WI. Southerly winds will bring rich boundary-layer moisture northward across TX, OK, and into southern KS, with 65-70 F dewpoints over TX and OK.  

Thunderstorms are likely to be ongoing in a warm advection regime from eastern NE into northern MO, aided by a 50 kt low-level jet. This activity may reinforce the boundary, and or shift it a bit south. Precipitation by the models contain quite a bit of variance, with some models showing storms forming around 18Z over KS. Some of this may be an artifact of steep lapse rates aloft combined with moist mid to upper level profiles. In any case, high clouds may be a concern regarding heating as forecast soundings have consistently shown substantial high cloud potential. Still, 2000-3000 J/kg MUCAPE is expected across the warm sector due to robust low-level moisture and steep lapse rates aloft. Shear profiles will strongly favor supercells, including the threat of tornadoes and very large hail. ECMWF hodographs depict large streamwise vorticity in the lowest 1km with significant tornado potential across the 30% area. Storms should focus along the dryline and also the front/outflow across KS. Other severe storms are expected during the evening across west-central TX where a southeasterly low-level jet will exist bring moisture westward where temperatures aloft will be cool. Hail and wind is most likely there.

"Westbrook and Adams were the only two that kept that game even close. Playoff P who was averaging 26 ppg and Melo both played like hot ass and barely looked to even shoot, yet Westbrook gets slammed for being too ball dominant.

"Celtics fan here. Just curious, no animosity towards your team nor your fanbase, I just feel like throughout this entire season Billy Donovan realistically did nothing to make sure that this Big 3 worked out. Immediate issues that come to mind is Westbrook being hard to coach in terms of transitioning from lone superstar with the ball in his hands 95&#37; of the team to being more team oriented & finding the right playstyle for the entire team while also finding the right formula for who gets the most shots/who get's plays ran through them compared to the other \(in terms of the big 3\). Similar to a big assignment due at the end of the year, this is something that you can't procrastinate on, it's a tough project that needs a lot of attention and you can't just hope that it all figures itself out. Well like most of us during our days in a School System it seems that Billy Donovan either did nothing or tried to do something when the team was already out of his control. TBH you could see these issues back when he first joined the team, sure it was a change of pace from Scott Brooks but there was no clear improvement \(at least from my perspective, obviously it would be nice if ya'll could shed some light on the topic if im just completely off\). 

Anyway, in the games where they played well and looked like a top tier defensive team with 3 unstoppable superstars, I think that could potentially be every game or at the very least more than what was had this season. I feel like in a perfect world you keep the whole team together for one more year and pick up someone like a Marc Jackson or Kevin Mchale, or hell even take a chance on a Kenny Smith and try to make a real run at something. The two things I hate about this situation is 1\) we, as fans of great basketball, will never get to see the true potential of this team and 2\) most of the blame by those who don't really follow the Thunder will primarily put the blame on Westbrook rather than understand the tough situation they were in as a whole. At the end of the day it's really a failure on the entire organization, but I'd place the bulk of the blame on Billy Donovan. Even if you didn't have that influence over the team before, even during Westbrook's MVP season, change needed to happen and this team needed to be guided to success like all the other successful big 3's. \(Doc Rivers and the Celitcs, Erik Spoelstra and the Heat, Marc Jackson and Steve Kerr for the Warriors\) I hope this team doesn't end up breaking up, or at the very least I hope you guys keep Westbrook and continue to build around him.

Melo, while I love him, has not worked out...and whether PG stays or walks our cap situation is still bad. Probably going to lose Grant too. Helllloooo mediocrity. 

My money is on Billy Donovan finally getting the boot. Someone has to be held accountable and Presti isn't going to fire himself. 

I'm just glad we can finally get over the Billy Donovan outcoached Pop fictional bullshit. 

Billy Donovan just got completely outcoached through 6 games with an MVP and a team with 3 All Star calibre players by a coach with role players and a rookie.

"In the sense that it might make PG13 look worse for leaving. This loss will be pinned on him, and hopefully that'll be enough to make him feel like he owes it to himself and to the team to resign, or he'll look like an absolute quitter (possibly worse than Durant)

Or it could very well lead to him realizing he's not made out for the big moment so he moves to a low pressure (non playoff) team in the Lakers.

I certainly hope it's the former. The best outlook for this team in the short term is to hope another year will build chemistry and togetherness that they sorely lacked (and get Roberson back).

"I jumped on OKC bandwagon as a long time Carmelo fan, I wasn’t born in US, moved here to SF a while ago thus I don’t have any personal or emotional connection to the city, I’m just a basketball fan who likes jump shooters like Dirk, TMac, Melo, Steph etc.

I find it extremely weird that Carmelo is underperforming and to be honest quite a lot considered his contract and what he’s known for, do you guys think he’s simply just regressing ? I mean we are talking about a guy who makes a living on his jumpers, the guy scored 50 points against the Heat on purely jump shots, he scored 23 points in a quarter, scored 62 in 3 quarter and a half and like 50 of those from jump shots, he’s been doing for 15 YEARS, fuc I think he’s even worse at layups than jump shots.

It breaks my heart to see him performing disappointedly though I cannot deny the fact, so I wonder what are the thunder fans arw thinking about him? What actually happened to him? Any basketball fan feel free to answer and state your opinion, I want to see him do well and win a ring before he retires.

"Whether we win tonight or not, this has been a very disappointing team. I feel like we can all agree about that.

It's easy to blame Presti in hind-sight, but we are in a huge predicament right now and I'm having a hard time seeing the silver lining.

The best case scenario is everyone re-ups and we try it all over again. But are we still a disappointing team, especially with this coach? Will BD have the balls to bench or play Melo 20-25 minutes a game? Will we implement an offensive style that gets all the guys in rhythm and plays with some pace? Will we play guys like Abrines over Ferguson? You know what I'm saying. What's the worth of this team with this current leadership/style?

Worst case scenario is PG leaves along with guys like Grant. We basically become the team from last year, but without Kanter (not unless we keep Grant) and without a back-up PG. We probably continue to get bounced in the first round unless Grant/Abrines/Ferguson make a major fucking leap.

Middle case scenario is a rebuild. I hate to see Russ in other colors and I don't know if he'd get the right kind of haul, but if PG leaves, perhaps let those guys go too and just rebuild. The West will be wide open in a few years in my opinion. There's no one on the Sixers/Celtics level of rebuild. Everyone in the West wants to try to compete right now. Kings/Memphis/Suns all have terrible FOs and I think OKC could probably still catch them.

"I constantly see our ball movement and our isolation\-heavy offense being criticised and I understand that. It's easy to get mesmerized by teams with less talent moving the ball wonderfully and generating easy shots for everyone. Whether you like it or not, though, that's not us. We have WB, PG13 and Melo, all of whom are players who thrive with the ball in their hands, and all of whom are able to generate high\-percentage shots by themselves. Adams and Brewer finish up the lineup, and neither of them are playmakers who should have to make too many decisions with the ball.

Creating a ball movement\-heavy system where everyone gets touches and there are tons of cuts and action just isn't our thing with this personnell.  If you don't believe me or Donovan, look at Popovich and what he did with LaMarcus Aldridge. For almost a season he tried to fit Aldridge in to their system, when Aldridge had played a massively different role for his entire carreer. That didn't work and Pop backed off, he let Aldridge do his thing, and he's happy and better utilized again.   An other example of iso\-heavy offense working is of course The Rockets. There's one key differense between their system and ours, and it's not ball movement, it's spacing.

So ball movement's not our problem, it's spacing. Watching the games and going through the replay, I constantly and constantly see possessions where 3, 4 or even 5 guys are inside the threepoint line. An other problem is our lack of off\-ball movement and action, so the defenders can just ball\-watch and sit in the paint.

Here's a few examples with poor spacing, execution and lack of off\-ball movement:

* In one of our playcalls there's a screen with wb and melo on the side, and an off\-ball screen on the other side for PG. This gets us possibly one of two things, a contested melo pull\-up midrange or a PG shot from an off\-ball screen. Both are outside jumpers and very easy for the defense. [https://imgur.com/KmMTwrs](https://imgur.com/KmMTwrs) In this example westbrook ended up attacking the screen, obviously ending up in a TO.
* Here's an example of laziness or whatever, but just poor execution. There's no reason for Melo to be standing inside the three\-point line. This way the defender can help Rudy out without leaving melo open. This ended up with PG missing a lay up, contested by Rudy. [https://imgur.com/JO3sjVp](https://imgur.com/JO3sjVp)
* In this one, a classic example of a play that is horrible in every way. Abrines doesn't hit the screen, which makes it completely useless, there are 4 guys standing inside the three\-point line, and WB ends up saing fuck it and chucking up a contested three\-pointer. [https://imgur.com/rNxTJdx](https://imgur.com/rNxTJdx)
* Even in transition, our spacing isn't there. Here, I'm not sure if WB should pass it to Melo and we get a Melo lay\-up or a Grant three, or if Melo should just RUN and cut of the way. Perhaps Grant should also be in Melos spot, as they can't help off of Melo as much. In the end this ends up as a missed layup between 6 guys, including 3 of ours.  [https://imgur.com/rwBU8qe](https://imgur.com/rwBU8qe)
* In this instance, the problem is not spacing per\-se, as Grant ends up cutting out of his position \(mind you, jogging\) but everyone standing still. Look at the Jazz defenders, they can't even see their own man! And they don't have to, because we have no off\-ball movement, or cuts that have a purpose of getting someone open. [https://imgur.com/C2KM2up](https://imgur.com/C2KM2up)

Here's some positives that I was able to find.

* Here, on the other hand is our 5 out lineup, and an example of excellent spacing that reminds me of the Rockets. We even have a secondary action on the other side which WB could turn to, if he couldn't for some reason attack Dante all alone \(which he did, succesfully\). [https://imgur.com/p6ncFqA](https://imgur.com/p6ncFqA)
* Here's the famous WB and Adams pick and roll. This is an example of meh spacing imo. It did generate a basket for Adams, and at least Melo's not standing inside the three\-point line, but I would like to see Melo and Brewer at least switch positions or something to take the defenders a little bit more out of the paint. [https://imgur.com/XahOyGz](https://imgur.com/XahOyGz)

So that's a very quick look at some of the problems. I'm not a coach or expert by any means, but these are some examples that I saw when going through the tape. I didn't go through the whole game when replaying, so this probably isn't even the worst examples. I hope this gives you an idea of the things that are problematic though, IMO. Like said, I'm no coach so I don't know what OKC should do to fix their offense, but the one's where guys are standing in the paint for no reason \(Melo...\) should be very easy to fix. Hopefully the Thunder can turn the switch and execute on offense for the rest of the series.

So ball movement's not our problem, it's spacing. Watching the games and going through the replay, I constantly and constantly see possessions where 3, 4 or even 5 guys are inside the threepoint line. An other problem is our lack of off\-ball movement and action, so the defenders can just ball\-watch and sit in the paint.

Here's a few examples with poor spacing, execution and lack of off\-ball movement:

* In one of our playcalls there's a screen with wb and melo on the side, and an off\-ball screen on the other side for PG. This gets us possibly one of two things, a contested melo pull\-up midrange or a PG shot from an off\-ball screen. Both are outside jumpers and very easy for the defense. [https://imgur.com/KmMTwrs](https://imgur.com/KmMTwrs) In this example westbrook ended up attacking the screen, obviously ending up in a TO.
* Here's an example of laziness or whatever, but just poor execution. There's no reason for Melo to be standing inside the three\-point line. This way the defender can help Rudy out without leaving melo open. This ended up with PG missing a lay up, contested by Rudy. [https://imgur.com/JO3sjVp](https://imgur.com/JO3sjVp)
* In this one, a classic example of a play that is horrible in every way. Abrines doesn't hit the screen, which makes it completely useless, there are 4 guys standing inside the three\-point line, and WB ends up saing fuck it and chucking up a contested three\-pointer. [https://imgur.com/rNxTJdx](https://imgur.com/rNxTJdx)
* Even in transition, our spacing isn't there. Here, I'm not sure if WB should pass it to Melo and we get a Melo lay\-up or a Grant three, or if Melo should just RUN and cut of the way. Perhaps Grant should also be in Melos spot, as they can't help off of Melo as much. In the end this ends up as a missed layup between 6 guys, including 3 of ours.  [https://imgur.com/rwBU8qe](https://imgur.com/rwBU8qe)
* In this instance, the problem is not spacing per\-se, as Grant ends up cutting out of his position \(mind you, jogging\) but everyone standing still. Look at the Jazz defenders, they can't even see their own man! And they don't have to, because we have no off\-ball movement, or cuts that have a purpose of getting someone open. [https://imgur.com/C2KM2up](https://imgur.com/C2KM2up)

Here's some positives that I was able to find.

* Here, on the other hand is our 5 out lineup, and an example of excellent spacing that reminds me of the Rockets. We even have a secondary action on the other side which WB could turn to, if he couldn't for some reason attack Dante all alone \(which he did, succesfully\). [https://imgur.com/p6ncFqA](https://imgur.com/p6ncFqA)
* Here's the famous WB and Adams pick and roll. This is an example of meh spacing imo. It did generate a basket for Adams, and at least Melo's not standing inside the three\-point line, but I would like to see Melo and Brewer at least switch positions or something to take the defenders a little bit more out of the paint. [https://imgur.com/XahOyGz](https://imgur.com/XahOyGz)

So that's a very quick look at some of the problems. I'm not a coach or expert by any means, but these are some examples that I saw when going through the tape. I didn't go through the whole game when replaying, so this probably isn't even the worst examples. I hope this gives you an idea of the things that are problematic though, IMO. Like said, I'm no coach so I don't know what OKC should do to fix their offense, but the one's where guys are standing in the paint for no reason \(Melo...\) should be very easy to fix. Hopefully the Thunder can turn the switch and execute on offense for the rest of the series.

"Unless they come back and win this series (and the way they gave up last night, I don't even see them winning game 5), I think Billy Donovan gets fired, (please) and possibly Sam Presti too. Nothing about this team has worked at all, and now we're staring years of mediocrity (at best) in the face. 

I'm almost tempted to want them to just blow it all up, hire a GM that can team build as well as draft, hire a coach that will put in some kind of system and force Russ to play in it. Let Russ have some input on who they hire, and put in a system that works with what Russ is naturally good at, but make it clear that he will have to adjust to whatever coach/system they put in place. If he won't do it, trade him and go full tank/Process. 

Presti has drafted well in the past as far as talent goes, but he can't seem to put the pieces together for a real team, and I think the sheer talent level we had for several years masked that. Even if PG stays, we're in cap hell with no draft picks, and there's next to no chance we get rid of Melo this off-season. If PG does decide to stay, maybe we should keep Presti on, but I feel like I've seen enough. 

It looks like this run is over. /r/NBA and the national basketball media hate Russ, the Thunder, and Oklahoma/OKC as a place. I don't think there's any digging out of this without blowing it up and starting over. I hope I'm wrong, though. Maybe Seattle will get an expansion team and people can at least stop shitting on us for that.

Maybe give Ettore Messina a shot otherwise? Or maybe there's some other young coach I'm not aware of that could pull a Spoelstra or Brad Stevens.

"Hello. I'm a Pistons fan. My team is not in the playoffs so I had to pick one (because basketball kind of sucks without a rooting interest). There are a lot of teams I could have chosen from; Dame and CJ are awesome and fun to watch so I could have gone with Portland, Minnesota was a great story, Utah has honorary Piston Donovan Mitchell (neverforget), the Wizards are so dysfunctional and yet so talented that I can't look away, etc... I think it was an interesting playoffs with a lot of interesting teams and not a lot of sure outcomes.


But the choice, ultimately, had to be OKC. And that is for reasons that go beyond basketball. OKC's team construction and play style are in and of themselves a declaration of war against modern basketball thinking. And as someone who dislikes modern basketball thinking (and more than anything: dislikes the proponents of modern basketball thinking), how could I choose any other team?


I've been taking a lot of L's recently as far as sports goes. Lions hired someone who I have zero faith in (and which smells of ""our GM hired his old drinking buddy from New England""), Red Wings and Pistons may each have the worst cap situations of their respective leagues, and Tigers are tearing it all down and it seems Miggy will never win a chip in the D. But this is all tribalistic nonsense. This, in all honesty, takes a backseat to the cultural war that is taking place in basketball.


And I think this war ultimately boils down to: do you enjoy basketball when it's on a spreadsheet or do you like, you know, actually watching it? Do you like basketball players who are jabbing and slipping like Floyd or do you like basketball players whom you are not sure if they even have a jab (the basketball Roy Jones Jr)?


I personally, go for the latter. Every time. Give me hatred. Give me spite. Give me a mountain of salt. I don't care; I am watching a human sport, not a computer Sim. This is the reason I love Russ and John Wall, and why I loved A.I. when he was playing even after his horrible stint with my team. These guys are certainly not the darlings of the basketball snob class. Both of them are flawed. Both of them can make bad decisions with the ball. But if you are anything but completely attentive, engaged, and excited when you're watching either of them run a fastbreak... then you hate basketball and also you're no fun.


I want the Thunder to win because of what it represents. It represents an L for the basketball female auxiliary (who are not a part of the basketball world but nonetheless feel inextricably connected with the modern current of thinking and treat it as their dogma), and it represents a W for what I call ""human basketball.""


Maybe I don't make any sense, I don't know. But I just hope these last three games were an aberration; that this team is too talented to get bounced so quickly and unceremoniously. If not... then the war is completely over and basketball will be forever ruined.","Why I hopped onto the OKC bandwagon Hello. I'm a Pistons fan. My team is not in the playoffs so I had to pick one (because basketball kind of sucks without a rooting interest). There are a lot of teams I could have chosen from; Dame and CJ are awesome and fun to watch so I could have gone with Portland, Minnesota was a great story, Utah has honorary Piston Donovan Mitchell (neverforget), the Wizards are so dysfunctional and yet so talented that I can't look away, etc... I think it was an interesting playoffs with a lot of interesting teams and not a lot of sure outcomes.


But the choice, ultimately, had to be OKC. And that is for reasons that go beyond basketball. OKC's team construction and play style are in and of themselves a declaration of war against modern basketball thinking.

"Yes , the situation is really shitty right now. We are losing to a team led by a rookie we expected to beat. But several things
1) People including me underestimated the Jazz , they were the best team down the stretch in league , Donovan Mitchell is somehow that good at 21 and they have a lot of good pieces. Its also a bad matchup for us with Gobert taking away what Russ is best at.

2) Our shooting has been absurdly bad its probably Utah’s but we have missed so maybe good looks the past 3 games so maybe we can get into a hot shooting streak we can win the next few games. PG and Melo have shown they can make shots in streaks. Even russ is much better usually at his mid range.

3) Donovan should not be fired! Sure he is flawed but the stale offense is not his fault , see how the all bench units played in the regular season played with a lot of ball movement. Its just really hard to implement when u have got 3 guys that revert to iso when all else fails. It pains to say its as much on Russ as anyone. He is not playing his game right now, lost his composure and is making stupid plays.

4) But even with flaws, Russ is not as bad as some here are calling. He is a great player, top 5 in league and Id take over anyone but Lebron and the Snake. He is a capable of so much better and he has shown it. He needs to calm down and play his game. He has not fully had a signature game yet this series, Melo can be at least a bit better, Adams has subpar.

"Grades.... based on the stats here... http://www.espn.com/nba/team/stats/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder

PG13 B- shooting and defense not bad, but dissappears when we need him, a complaint carried over at times from Indiana.

Westbrook C- my favorite player but he is shooting 38% on twos and under 30% on 3s. If he wasnt bringing energy and effort it would be an F. Also 5.3 TOs is totally unacceptable.

Melo C His shooting actually isnt bad, but not in top form, and thats his strength at this point of his career. Now if you compare him to prime melo, he would get a D- but players age. Its just a fact of life, and not fair to expect that of him, but we should expect more than what we are getting.

More commentary on westbrook and melos shooting. Westbrooks adjusted fg% is 39%. Next lowest is melo at 49%. I think league average for afg% is around 53%. Everyone else on the team is above 50% with adams leading the way as usual (actually brewer and felton are slightly better, but all 3 combined take less shots than pg or wb individually.) Also whats killing us is the least efficient shooter is shooting the most at 20 shots per game, and our most efficient scorers are shooting among the least on a per minutes basis.

Also for points per shot, westbrook has a miserable 1.02 with melo 2nd worst at 1.12. PGs pps is just fine but he needs help from others.
1.2 pps is the absolute minimum you would expect from a star player on the perimeter, and an above average big guy, with many above 1.3, some above 1.4 (lebron, durant) and the best scorers around 1.5 (harden, curry.) Our 1st and 3rd option aren't getting it done. 1.02 pps is just horrible and 1.12 is not good.

Adams C- Too many fouls, not enough rebounds, not enough shots (but thats not ALL his fault.) atleast he keeps his composure, but we need him to challenge gobert for boards and stay in the game.

Brewer B- playing to about the expected level. Brings energy and effort. Unfirtunately he is not roberson, and though better on offense, he doesnt get much opportunity there with all of our chuckers. Makes me think roberson mght actually be better on offense on another team and that he just cant develop here being relayed to 5th option.

Billy Donovan F thoroughly being outcoached this series.

Bench C+ Grant is playing to about his experience. A little more seasoning and he would be better. I think he will get there with another team, since we wont be able to afford him. The bench is not deep or experienced other than Felton, and are not really making any kind if difference in this series, and we need them to, thus the C+. I would say that they are only playing slightly worse than expected though. 

And actually the one game we won at home was because of our bench play mostly, and paul george gets some credit there too. The starters overall have not been good as a unit in any of the 4 games.

"Just wanted to get everyone's thoughts on what adjustments should be made for tonight.

The two that really stood out to me after Saturday's game were:

- Attack Rudy Gobert. Probably easier said than done, but our bread and butter this year has been plays inside to Adams to open games. Westbrook has to be in attack mode. I don't care if Gobert gets some blocks, it's worth it if we can get him in foul trouble early.

- I think ""Playoff P"" has to pick up Donovan Mitchell from the beginning of the game. I understand why he's been starting on Ingles, but I don't like Brewer on Mitchell for 2 or 3 quarters.

"Obviously last game was horrible, but from the ashes of that negativity I noticed something - the Thunder play like garbage with Adams out of the starting lineup. So the obvious answer is to keep him on the floor as long as possible to maximize effectiveness. But how do you go about doing this? If I'm Donovan, my lineup for game 4 will be Westbrook/George/Melo/Patterson/Adams, with George sliding back to his original position and Melo sliding back to his natural position. This allows the Thunder to match the Jazz size since they don't have the ability to play small effectively against Gobert. On defense I would task Patterson with containing Gobert to prevent Adams from reaching foul trouble. When the initial subs come in I would put in Grant for Patterson, and then when Adams goes to the bench put Patterson back in. 

This lineup has the ability to space the floor better; and prevents Melo from getting eaten alive by Favors and gives Adams an easier time on defense. 

This might not fix all the issues the Thunder have, but I feel this gives them the best chance of taking back the series.","How to matchup with the Jazz Obviously last game was horrible, but from the ashes of that negativity I noticed something - the Thunder play like garbage with Adams out of the starting lineup.

If I'm Donovan, my lineup for game 4 will be Westbrook/George/Melo/Patterson/Adams, with George sliding back to his original position and Melo sliding back to his natural position. This allows the Thunder to match the Jazz size since they don't have the ability to play small effectively against Gobert. On defense I would task Patterson with containing Gobert to prevent Adams from reaching foul trouble. When the initial subs come in I would put in Grant for Patterson, and then when Adams goes to the bench put Patterson back in. 

This lineup has the ability to space the floor better; and prevents Melo from getting eaten alive by Favors and gives Adams an easier time on defense.

"I catch Jazz games whenever I can and I've never seen that arena so lit. Jazz played well, but their fans absolutely gave them a boost. They put us to shame.

"I don't know about you guys, but from what I saw in the season, what makes Westbrook special is his penetrating ability.  He can score so easily down low.  And that penetration free's up Adams for pick and roll action (around 1/2 of Westbrook's assists were to adams).  

&nbsp;

Golbert (and the utah defense...but mostly Golbert) completely eradicate those advantages.  Westbrook can't drive and finish as he usually does.  Can't pass to Adams for a 5 footer or a dunk.  

&nbsp;

What does this leave the team with?  It leaves Westbrook shooting mid-range and 3's while also passing out to 3pt shooters only.  He can't pass inside.  *I'd say a good 35% of the offense has been taken away from OKC by Golbert and the Utah defense*.

&nbsp;

**So, what alternatives do you guys have to counteract the OKC lack of offense because of Golbert's influence over Russell?**  Melo and George aren't enough, but man, I feel like OKC just needs to push Melo/George as much as possible cause even if they shoot inefficiently, it'll be better than Westbrook's passes and shots being neutralized.

"Jazz are getting away with tons of push offs and Rudy is not capable of being called for a foul. Then on the other end, we get officiated tightly. 

Call the game both ways!  We're getting mugged in the paint. Adams and Brewer shouldn't have 4 fouls at the beginning of the 2nd half. 

Billy Donovan needs to get a tech!! Scotty woulda grabbed those refs by the neck and shook some sense into them. 

Russ needs to the care of the ball tho..

"Against a good center like Gobert, when Adams is out or not 100% we get fucked in the ass. We have so many players that BD doesn't even play (Singler, Huestis, Hamilton, etc) and no backup center.

Instead, Adams fouls out of a close game and we have absolutely *NO ONE* that can come in and even *attempt* to handle Gobert.

"I’ve watched the first playoff game three times and I’ve noticed the majority of the plays used that night were unused the majority of the season. The true spark between teammates was unreal. I’m starting to wonder if the thunder have been hiding their true potential so there was no film of their plays that are fool-proof. Maybe I’m hallucinating but I hadn’t seen those plays before all season.  

I don’t really focus on the media and how they portray the team because if it’s not Oklahoma announcers everyone talks mad shit on the thunder and Westbrook. 

Win/lose does Paul George stay in OKC? Does Melo stay after this season? I’ve seen melo playoff style and he can be a force to be reckoned with. Tonight I can almost promise that Paul George will be double and triple teamed tonight outside the arc and he will have to kickout to melo or Westbrook or abrines. I’m calling okc 117 and Utah 110 for the final score tonight. We will get behind 15 points in the third quarter but our bench will come out and unfuck everything.

Am I crazy or am I onto something with the plays being new and unused? I feel like they didn’t want film of the plays that work really well. 

Does PG and Melo stay after this season? Does Enes come back? I’m really thinking that I can bet a dead hooker on Steven Adams making a three attempt in this series from the left wing.

I hope this doesn’t get me in trouble on this thread. I hope the thunder come out in a rage tonight and beat that ass.  THUNDER UP!!","Has OKC been hiding its true potential?

I need some help/advice from the /r/nba community. I've spoken about this before to a couple of people and I've received a good reception, but I've done nothing about it. I want to write a book about Russell Westbrook.

I don't really know how to frame the story or what I want I want to say explicitly about him. What I do know is that I find him fascinating. I find his energy and the way he carries himself, on and off the court, beyond unique. He makes me feel like anything is possible. Watching him play basketball makes me think superhumans exist.

What I'd like, if it's available, is advice on how I can frame a novel length book around him. I thought it might be interesting to talk about ""the most statistically brilliant season ever"" but with this season over it kind of feels like a moot angle to pursue. But I still feel this urge to just talk about how amazing he is as an athlete and a human.

I'd really love if people would be able to give me some guidance on what they think is a good way to frame Russell's work in a way that I can present cogently to an audience that might not quite grasp just how special he is.

Sorry if this is boring or trite, I don't know, I love Russell Westbrook and to be honest so should you. That's what I want to achieve, that he's really worth understanding as a human.","The Russell Westbook (this was deleted twice by the mods on /r/nba so I took it here)

I’ve been to almost every playoff game the thunder have played. The atmosphere tonight was solid - not WCF against the spurs but solidly in playoff mode. The fans were in it from tip to finish and booed the hell out of the offensive foul call on Russ for the next 5min.

I’m not sure what game the idiots on the radio were watching but with Rudy in the paint we have to change play style. It’s not a hard concept to understand.

"I think it will be a good series. Don't get me wrong. But I'ma bit more of the mindset that the games will be close moreso than this being a 7 game series. You know what I mean?

I know Utah completely overachieved but they're in the same boat as the Blazers to me...they successfully took advantage of injuries to other teams. Not to mention Utah closed on a pretty easy schedule (easier than ours).

Now that we have time to prepare just for one team, I'm looking at it and thinking where does Utah have an advantage? Gobert and Adams are at best a wash and the other 4 positions I'd take our guys over theirs.

I mean we're asking Paul fucking George how he feels about guarding a rookie. Wtf? Yes Joe Ingles is a fool but there is a reason he is where he is in his career. Rubio? Uhh...come on.

Down in Section 105, a man sits with a strikingly vacant seat next to him. As the game goes on, it becomes apparent to the fans around him that no one is going to claim this seat, and during timeouts people start to talk amongst themselves.

“Hey man, fantastic seats, but I couldn’t help but notice the empty one next to you. Do you know anything about it?”

“Yeah,” the man replied, “it’s my wife’s seat. My wife just passed away, and it’s the first Thunder playoff game we haven’t been together.”

“I’m sorry to hear that. Glad that you guys are such great fans, though. This is an incredible atmosphere, I’m sure she would’ve loved it here.” They go back to the game, but the first guy’s curiosity is still getting the best of him, so he leans over again. “I still have to ask, even without your wife, didn’t you have someone to give the ticket to?

Westbrook is my second favorite player in the league (behind KP) and I’ve always loved the Thunder and their arena. You guys give me an actual reason to watch the playoffs this year and actively root for a team. 

Also, I’ve watched the last 24 or so Thunder games (since KP went down) and I want to let you know that Melo will more than likely turn it on in the playoffs. He’s much older now but he knows he can’t play playoff level every game. I think y’all saw it in the HOUSTON game when it’s a must-win scenario. I truly think he’ll come out and surprise you.

"The Rockets game was a watershed moment for Russ. This was the game he made a true believer out of me. Until now, I have loved Russ but always questioned whether he had the decision making ability to take a team to the very top. 

This game was incredible from Russ. His decision making was spot on. He utilised his drive to the rim game but sprinkled it with kick outs to PG and Melo perfectly. 

The Rockets were packing the paint and stopping the pick and roll, which usually works against the Thunder. To see him adjust so well on the fly and not get frustrated showed me that he continues to mature and add the needed variation to his game.  It finally looked like we were playing chess not checkers. 

The result was a plethora of good looks which we nailed.  That extra split second for the shooters to get set and lock in on the hoop. This was due to the defence not knowing where we were going to strike next.  

The defence was awesome as well, but I always knew Russ had that when he was locked in. 

Russ finally showed me what a true point guard looks like. Add to his outrageous athleticism and I am amped to see him lead OKC going forward. 

Ps: point god Russ is needed to attract free agents as well

"I hope PG stays.

But if he decides he doesn't want to stay and wants to go to LA, what does Presti have up his sleeve?

What if Paul George has nothing but good will towards OKC and doesn't want to leave Russ and Melo dirty?

Here's what I'm thinking:

Presti and George's people get together and execute a sign and trade with LA.

This is a different situation than the one that the Pacers found themselves in. They knew George wasn't re-signing. LA was comfortable waiting it out.

1 year later the Thunder hold the cards here. LA can wait it out again, but if George wants to he can always sign a 2 year contract with an ETO to see out the WB-Melo-George big 3 experiment. 

So how does LA get George this summer? They trade away Deng, Kuzma, and a 2019 1st rd pick. 

The trade benefits LA because they get George and drop Deng. Sure, they lose Kuzma, but they still have Ingram. They part ways with a 1st rd pick, but realistically how good would the pick actually be if PG was on the team? Would it even be a lottery pick?

Thunder would have to absorb Deng's contract, but get promising prospect in Kuzma. 

Is this better than just letting George walk?

"Russell is only getting older. The way he plays is mostly from his insane athleticism, and athleticism wears down over time than other things. He's turning 31 next year, prime usually lasts until 32-33, sooner varying surgeries, medical, athletics, pasts etc all takes into account. It would be extremely difficult and taxing to try and build something special in that stretch.

**Would it hurt more to see Russell get old, wither away and never win a Championship.**

or

**Leave, putting him in the best case scenario to compete and potentially win a Championship.**

As a Thunder fan i would love nothing more in the world than to see Russell Westbrook and his family beside him holding the Larry O'Brien over his head with tears of joy overtaking him, even if we can't get it done here. Just knowing he got his will satisfy me enough with joy. He gave us his body and some of his greatest years in a OKC Thunder jersey, i feel we owe him that much.

If PG leaves, Melo opts in then that entire year of his prime will be another wasted opportunity. In the NBA your biggest enemy is time, something Russell's ometer is running high on these days, unfortunately.

"First off, I know we're not in the best place to be talking about what seed we want, but I'm going to anyways.


At this point of this season, realistically speaking, we are probably not going to win the championship. If we had Dre, it'd be a whole other conversation but we don't. Therefore, I think the goal of this season is performing well enough to make a case for Paul George to stay. That's why we need the 7th seed because it gives us the best chance of making it to the WCF thus making the strongest argument for Paul George to stay.


First off, let's be honest here. We aren't going to beat Houston in a bo7 especially considering they have the home game advantage. So avoiding Houston for as long as possible is the name of the game. Therefore, 8th seed is obviously the worst option, but I'd even argue that the 4th seed is the second worst option in the long run. This would lead to us playing Houston in the second round, and a second round exit is not enough to convince George to stay. At the very least, it's not a strong argument to stay.


For the exact same reasoning, we do not want the 5th seed as it'd mean playing a GSW team that has Steph Curry in a bo7. This would most likely result in a second round exit which again is most likely not enough to get Paul George to stay. We need to make it to the WCF.


If we were to get the 7th seed, it'd mean playing a Curryless GSW, and I honestly think we have a decent chance at winning this match up. If either George or Melo played decently, that game probably would have been a stomp. 


If we beat the GSW, that'd mean we'd play either Portland or whoever ends up being the 6th seed. This is obviously easier than playing a full GSW or Houston team, and the easiest way to make a strong case for Paul George to stay.


With all of that being said, I just hope we make it to playoffs.

"I think it's okay to admit that this year has been somewhat of a disappointment. We'll probably have the same record as last year while feeling like we are a worse team, but I'm wondering if we should keep things in perspective here.

**The loss of Dre was huge**

In December we went 12-5. We were a combined 22-9 in December and January when it seemed we hit our stride. That's a 70% win percentage. That's like winning 57-58 games over a season. When our starting unit played together we were something like 16-1. Dre had the highest +/- on/off court. Adams and Westbrook are behind him (could be a matter of sample size but still).

We *had* it figured out. Dre's defense and his ability to cut were extremely important. If Dre comes back better than 80%, don't you think we could win 10 more games next year at the very least?

**The addition of Corey Brewer could be big**

Corey ain't Dre but I do think having him in the starting line-up has not been all that bad. Since getting here he's given us 10ppg/3.5r/1.4 assists while shooting 35% from 3 and 80% from the FT line in 28 minutes. He is solid. He is active. And he could be a lovely bench player to spell Andre next season.

He knows his role and plays in it very well, in my opinion. He is not at all washed and he is fasstttt. He's got a lot more basketball in him and I think we should be excited to have these lengthy defenders on our team.

***Where else is Jerami going to go?***

Jerami Grant deserves to get fucking paid. He's been a dog on defense and a MAN on offense. He's hitting FTs and 3s in the 2nd part of this season and man...we are all sad that JG is probably on his way out of here next season.

But is he? What teams have money? The bottom of the barrel teams. Many other contenders are in our position with not having a ton of money available and with PG/LeBron being FAs and with people trying to trade for Kawhi, I can't imagine Jerami is going to be at the top of a lot of contender's lists.

A lot of orgs overspent maxing guys like Otto Porter and paying guys like Kent Bazemore hella money. No one wants to do that again. Grant makes less than $2ms this year. You don't think he'd take the MLE from OKC if we offered it? I bet he would...

**We simply aren't making shots**

In the game threads I'm always so confused when you guys are complaining about lack of ball movement and bad defense and stuff like that. We're #11 in offense and defense rating while having the 8th best net rating. We're somewhere between a top 10 team this season, even with all our hiccups. 

[Jon Hamm seemed to confirm by suspicions with his stats.](https://twitter.com/JonMHamm/status/981649390933864448) In the past 7 games, we're passing **TWO MORE** potential assists (the ball *is* moving) per game while converting on **TWO LESS** potential assists per game. We've been losing by a possession here and possession there. We aren't getting blown out. Our guys just can't seem to make shots. 

My guess is the exertion of energy on the defensive end. We switch everything and now we're starting to fight over screens on guards (which is good) so that Steve isn't out there guarding quick, short dudes. But I'm sure that shit is tiring, idc if you're Roberson or Carmelo. It requires a TON of energy to run through screens set by big ass dudes to catch up with a quick ass dude. TOUGH.

PG says his shot mechanics aren't right. Melo actually hasn't been all bad since ASB and Russ is gonna Russ no matter what. 

I know this year has been wack and I've said it and I've seen people say we need to just let PG walk, but the more I think about it, the more I think everyone should give it one more try. I was proponent of PG giving us a 1+1 deal and I still think he could/should. Melo probably won't opt out so if we're going to be in the tax, we should at least do it while competitng. Plus, there's not a ton of other guys that will be on the market that we'd want other than like Marcus Smart.

TL;DR: we've had a lot of things working against us but we're still a top team in the NBA this year. With Dre coming back and better rotations for next year probably, we'd have a much better season. Shouldn't we try to aim for that?","Should we not give up on our bigger picture? I think it's okay to admit that this year has been somewhat of a disappointment.

"Good evening Thunder fans,

Let me start by saying some of you guys have become literally insufferable. I think its a combination of a lack of quality content, some new fans who don't seem to understand the ebb and flow of the NBA and a lackluster year after such high expectations have led to many of our long term readers being driven away and replaced with what we have today.

Now I try to stay completely unbiased and delete as little as possible to allow you guys to create the content you really want on the sub, leaving you in charge of upvoting and downvoting what you think is necessary. For a while we were getting by on just banning the trolls that occasionally drifted in from other parts of Reddit, but we are about to shift our focus inwards towards our own community.

  

* Spammers.

Now listen, I don't want to shit on your dreams of starting a podcast, blog or YouTube channel. However, if you're simply using Reddit and Twitter to spam links to your 3rd party content we are going to ban you and blacklist your site. If you're active on this community and posting other content or commenting frequently things that are not related to your 3rd party site then we are all for you boosting exposure to your projects every now and then within reason. This will be judged on a case by case basis so don't be surprised when this rule is suddenly strictly enforced.



* Negativity.

Here's the one I'm not looking forward to. Telling overly emotional and pissed off people to chill out tends to not be very easy. However here are a few general concepts for how we are going to enforce this one. 

Having an opinion is fine. 
Do you think Billy Donovan is a terrible coach? That's your prerogative, feel free to express that opinion whenever its on topic and civil. If you think this opinion is worth sharing in a post, please go into detail about why, give examples of poor coaching decisions and share who you think might be a good replacement. **DO NOT** post some single sentence brain neutral post that adds nothing to the conversation other then letting us know where you stand on the issue. These posts will be removed at the mods discretion.

Being negative is fine.
If you're angry post-game, feel free to vent in the post-game thread. Call out all the shitty plays that happened, all the terrible decisions made by any player all the feelings you have about that guys contract or this guys potential or lack there of. **However** if all you do is bitch about everything that happens day in and day out, we are going to ban you. This isn't because we are power hungry basement dwelling neckbeards, its because hardly anyone enjoys that and we have been overwhelmed with requests to cut down on it. We will slowly implement this rule so as not to shock anyone. You will start with a 1 day ban and a warning, a note will be added to your name via mod tools then next time you're gone. We don't have time to keep tabs on thousands of you so if this seems harsh, we are sorry.


* Relevant posts.

Please keep simple concepts posts in the pre-game, game and post-game threads. If Kyle Singler posterizes Lebron James and everyone is hyped up and you want to say simply SINGLER IS THE FUCKING GOAT, then please for the love of God just post that in the game thread rather than making a post that says  only that. If you have a streamable of the dunk, feel free to post it as a stand alone post. If someone wants to make a Singer dunks on Lebron upvote party, go right ahead even though that's somewhat tacky. If 17 people post upvote parties after anyone does anything we are going to delete everything but the first post.


In summary we are just going to be more strict with crap content in an attempt to make the sub more enjoyable. Please feel free to discuss these changes in this thread.

Thank you for your time,

In summary we are just going to be more strict with crap content in an attempt to make the sub more enjoyable. Please feel free to discuss these changes in this thread.

Thank you for your time,

"Ever since the all star break (but especially recently) all people talk about is how Melo and George are checked out and and we only have Westbrook to carry these games. Westbrook is our star so I get that, but without the consistent effort from Adams these games wouldn’t even be close. 2 of our “big three” and the bench are inconsistent and that’s all anyone take about. Meanwhile, Steven Adams is leading the league in offensive rebounds while averaging career highs on points and fg%. Nothing really else to say other than that we should appreciate that we have arguably the most dynamic PG-C duo in the league for a few more years.

"Hi fellow Thunder fans, I wanted to post my Playoffs tracker for several reasons:

1. To make sure I didn't make any incorrect assumptions/calculations/etc
2. To see if you have different thoughts on my projections for the remaining games
3. To show you where I project Thunder ending up in the Playoffs (which is 8th seed vs the Rockets)

This is an Excel file which I am uploading via Zippyshare (I have a personal phobia/avoidance of Google Docs, its very clunky to me)

https://www108.zippyshare.com/v/A3IwQjUR/file.html

What I've done is listed all the remaining WC games by day and entered my projections for who will win/lose.  This was done relatively quickly just based on their prior games this year, looking at who has B2B games, home court advantage etc etc.  Let me know if you think anything will fall differently! Then I have actualized the file for yesterday's games and will continue to do so throughout the remainder of the season.

For the Thunder, I had us winning last night :( and for the remaining three games I have L vs Rockets, L vs Heat, W vs Grizzlies.  For all the other still relevant west conference teams, of course there are a ton of remaining games so you can check those out on your own.

With these results, I have us projected at 8th seed -- a tie with the Pelicans which they have the tiebreaker (note that the ranking in cells AA14:AC23 do not know how to take into account tiebreaker ranking so that has to be done manually in your head -- I could probably build that in for next time, would need to list out the whole season's games)

If we take a W vs the Heat, that bumps us up to a three-way tie with Wolves and Spurs, ceteris paribus.  I have determined that the tiebreakers in that case would have us in the 7th seed since we have the worst record of those three teams in games amongst the three (them both 4-3, us 3-5).  Fun fact all those games were won by the home team except for one, which I believe was that ridiculous double no-call Andrew Wiggins hero chuck game (not that I'm bitter or anything).  

Anyway, I just wanted to show my file to some fellow fans to see what they think about the upcoming games.  I think we will end up in 7th - 8th seed, let's just pray for a big W vs the Heat to boost us into that 7th seed, and then Russ to go super sayan against the Curry-less Warriors!

I would love to know if you have any different predictions for the remaining games (not just Thunder but all of them!  Since it all matters)

Please let me know if I made any mistakes as well and I will amend the file.



Also FWIW, 538 gives us a 93% chance of making the playoffs.  We got this!

"Starting a discussion (hopefully) about first round matchups, assuming we make the playoffs which i think we will. Let's look first at who we have a chance at playing which is basically anyone, and then discuss who we would rather have in the first round.

The standings as of today:

1. Rockets
2. Warriors
3. Trail Blazers
4. Spurs
5. Thunder
6. Jazz
7. Timberwolves
8. Pelicans

As it stands today, we would play the Spurs in the first round, which I don't think would be too bad for us. I highly doubt Leonard comes back just to play in the playoffs against a historical Rockets team and the incumbent Warriors. The Spurs names we're used to are all faded and coming off the bench. However, LMA is on a tear that should not be discounted.

When we look at the remaining games against GSW, HOU, MIA, and MEM its seems unlikely that we will climb the ranks any further, however the race is close enough that we could theoretically choose our matchup when the time comes. Dropping a single slot would put us up against a hungry Portland with CJ ""the thunder eater' McCollum. I like this matchup less than I do the one against the spurs but still am not too terribly frightened. Dame has to be respected- and certainly we need to keep a lid on CJ- but i think that in a 7 game series we are less likely to get torched by him more than once.

Dropping two places and we get the warriors. To be honest this is the most interesting match. On the one hand you have the knee jerk reaction to RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN. And there's a lot of merit to that though. The championship team is basically unchanged with big names from front to back. They can and will put you in the ground if you take them lightly. One only needs to go back a couple years to reopen that old wound. Klay can black out and beat you without even seeming to try. Not to mention KD. But on the other hand is my faith in my team. I think that while we have fallen off a little bit since the allstar break I think that our fire is there and just waiting for the right moment to burst. Losing Andre was a huge blow to our playoff aspirations but i think we got a decent hole filler in Brewer. This is a matchup that i think we could lose, but one that if we did win would give us huge momentum and confidence while also taking the piss out of the warriors which i know is something we would all enjoy.

The last is the Rockets. All that stuff i said about knee jerk reactions applies here. RUN AWAY. This is the team i want no part of in the first round. Harden is unstoppable. Yes, he does disappear in the playoffs sometimes but i dont think that happens this year. I believe the Rockets have their hearts set on the championship and they have a really good chance of getting it imo. I would rather face them in a  later round after they've been beat up by the pelicans or jazz, and even then I'm not too sure. 

When we began the season our goal was basically to do well enough to persuade PG to stay a little longer and give it another shot. That is pretty much a WCF appearence or bust. I believe we can do that, but we will have to beat the Rockets or Warriors to do so. What do you guys think?","Who do we want in round 1?

"PG's mind is obviously in LA. The dude said ""I play better in warmer weather"" the other day. He teases LA fans with little snippets. He gone. I don't even think we should make him an offer next season unless his attitude changes. The drama over his decision has been overwhelming, and to be honest he hasn't played like a max contract player this season. Let's move on. 

Adams is developing into a monster. Russ is already a beast. We should keep Grant instead and develop T Ferg into a 3&D monster and develop Abrines into a spot up shooter(by actually giving him the minutes to get into a groove). We'll still have Melo, and he needs to come off the bench. Donovan is gone next season(I think). It would be idiotic to keep BD.

"i think one reason why we are underperforming is because the OK3 just isn't working as seamlessly as we'd like it to be. Russ wants to set his guy up for the perfect shot and he wants that guy to shoot.

i feel like paul does the same. so many times i feel like in the last 2 games, he's overplaying. he gets a wide open shot but choose to put the ball on the floor and try to create on top of a created play. just shoot the simple shot.

this is why it hink russ and the bench work so well together. abrines/grant/pat dont desire to put the ball on the floor and create. they will quickly take a shot. that kinda rhythm matters. last year's team was effective because they moved up and down the court at a ridiculosu pace. now we just dribble dribble dribble.

Reasons:

-Terrible play caller
-Lack of team identity
-Offense is very stagnant, lots of iso ball besides Russ & Adams pick & roll
-Still experimenting with lineups this late
-Doesn’t seem to reprimand Russ and others for their blunders
-Abundance of coaching mistakes throughout the season
-Doesn’t make adjustments when they need to be made
-Can’t galvanize team for consistent effort

"I would like to preface this by saying that Russ has been my favorite player in the league since this team moved to OKC, so I don't think I need to point out what makes him great and all of that jazz.

That being said, I want to have an honest conversation about his defense. Last night he was really bad. I know he's never been considered a lockdown guard defender, but games when he's truly locked in (i.e against golden state and houston) it elevates (obviously) the team defense. I hate when you can tell from the first possession that he's taking the night off on defense. He won't fight over picks (which I think forces us to switch when we probably shouldn't be), he'll wander around the baseline, leave his man open from 3, not closeout on shooters. Of course, Roberson made up for a lot of those mistakes the same way Ibaka used to as a rim defender. 

Last year I gave Russ the benefit of the doubt because of the load he was carrying on offense, but man, this year there have been games where he is just not locked in at all.","The Brodie I would like to preface this by saying that Russ has been my favorite player in the league since this team moved to OKC, so I don't think I need to point out what makes him great and all of that jazz.

We might have a chance next year. It’s too late in the season to look like this. It’s completely unacceptable. They’re millionaires who get paid to play a game and they’re not even trying. This team puts forth zero effort and there exists no accountability. Donovan is the root of the problem. This squad will not go anywhere in the post season - if it makes it at all. ,"Get rid of Donovan, blow up the bench, and tell Russell to not take threes. We might have a chance next year.

"Something i probably should of a long time ago. Stop watching until the playoffs. I watched every single one of our games this season and hoping things would get better and now i'm starting to lie to myself. This isn't good for my health lol.

"I'm not trying to rain (no pun intended) on everyone's parade here, but after reading a few posts in the last few days about playoff seeding and winning a title I decided to look something up.

A seed lower than 3 has only won the NBA title twice, last happening in 1995 when the 6 seed Houston Rockets won the title. The other time was the 4 seed Boston Celtics in 1969. No 5, 7, or 8 seed has ever won a championship.

Only 7 3 seeds have ever won a title, the last being the 2011 Dallas Mavericks. 

59 out of 68 NBA Finals have been won by a 1 or 2 seed.

It is totally realistic and fair to expect a second round or WCF playoff run, but I'm just trying to think rationally.

"At this point, the 3 seed looks out of reach.  I think that it is to our advantage to be in the GSW’s side of the bracket, as I think we match up better with them than with Houston, and also it would be so sweet to beat KD.  If this is true, then our options are reduced to the 6th seed and the 7th seed.  As the sixth seed, we play Portland in the first round, and while optimistic, that’s not a series I want to play.  If we get the 7th seed, we can play the warriors likely without Curry, being led by the reptilian self-proclaimed non leader.  I like our chances in such a series, and it would give us a ton of confidence heading into round two.  I hope those in the Thunder organization are at least thinking about possible ways to make this happen… I realize that gunning for the 7th seed is playing with fire, but I just think it is the ideal situation.     

Edit: I see that Portland lost today, but given Steph's injury I still think the 7th seed is the best.  ","Playoff seeding goals At this point, the 3 seed looks out of reach.

"I am worried about The Thunder, not yet, but can not be happy with the development right now. Theres a buch of stuff that doesnt seem to work.

Assists.   Yesterday agaist Portland for example, is like they stop sharing the ball and play only ISO.

Shoot selection.  Bad choices. Example: Anthony shoot two 3 in less than a 3 seconds,  common stop and make a play, if you have a bad night dont force it.  

Plays.  Dont have one. Even Hawk play is not there anymore.

If Felton doesnt have a good day. The bench is like out.   Sometines Grant is haveng a good day.   

There have been like a lot of games with bad ""luck"" with the score. Its like the ball doesnt whant to go in,  that frustrate the players and do dumn stuff.

Adams is so consistent, maybe the best player with RW.

Need to trust more in Felton, Pat, Grant, Evem Abrines. Sit more players that dont have a good night,  they can survive one game sitting down. 

The record hurts bacause OKC have lost games because dumb shoot selecction in the last shoot ( agaist Detroit lost by 1). Or because the refeeres are blind ( Bucks, Min, Etc)

The losts agaist Portland and Celtics it wasnt because Anthony.  All the team was like zzz.  

I know they are good, with or whitout AR. But they need to focus better.  

Give them some time?  Mmm. They already have that.    I hope they wake up in playoffs,  if they reach them because playing like that we are in danger.  And positions 7,8,9 are not a good spot to play in the first key.

At this point, I don't believe Billy will be the coach next year. I think Melo is going to opt in to his player option, and I think PG may sign a one year deal to give this team another shot with Robes healthy. (I imagine Presti would sell him on how good him and Robes were on defense + potentially a new coach/new system or something.)

Or is it because Melo isn't the same player he once was? Melo can still score, he has shown it in multiple games. His highest +/- in a game is +31 while his lowest is -26. 

Melo obviously isn't as good as he once was, but we shouldn't just give up on him and bench him the rest of the season because we just lost to a great team who can beat anyone.

"Just curious, because obviously Melo is a negative asset, but at least he's coming off the books. Griffin on the other hand is still probably worth his money (or at least *way* more than Melo) but probably won't be by the end of the contract. Similarly Westbrook will take up tons of cap and probably won't be worth his salary by the end of his contract either. So in 4 years it might not be too pretty, but it'd likely be ugly even just with Westbrook anyway.

Griffin isn't a better shooter than Melo (but Melo has been garbage this year), but he's at least a much better facilitator (and not a black hole), more athletic, faster, better rebounder, and better defender, which are also big improvements over Melo.

So would you do the trade?","Even though Melo would waive his NTC for this, would you trade Melo for Blake Griffin in the upcoming offseason (assume PG stays and signs either a full max or a 2 year deal) Just curious, because obviously Melo is a negative asset, but at least he's coming off the books.

"Saw a post on r/nba about the all NBA teams and OP had Kyrie over Russ for 2nd team. That's his opinion and that's fine but I started making my case for Russ and well got long winded...


**Just the stats**: 

Kyrie 24.4/3.8/5.1

Westbrook 25.3/9.7/10.2

Russ has 3x as many rebounds (best rebounding guard in the league bar none even if you take out any ""stat padding boards"" he's easily over 8 a game). Russ also has TWICE as many assists (they're both point guard remember?) and *leads the league in dimes* while still averaging more points. 


**Efficiency**:

Kyrie does have better percentages across the board but aside from 3p% Russ is league average or better at the basic % numbers.  Certainly the edge goes to Kyrie here.


**Clutch/Leadership**:

Kyrie benefits from having a FAR superior coach. He's really clutch but at best he's equal or slightly less clutch than Westbrook. Any argument such as Russ ""isn't fun to play with"" or ""he dribbles the air out of the ball"" doesn't hold water here. Kyrie is a much worse passer & does as much pounding the rock and jacking shots. 


**Advanced Stats**:

Pretty equal PER's and win shares while Russ has a higher FT rate. 

In regards to Usage Rate. Russ is at 34% and Kyrie 31%. Both top 8 league wide. So I don't want to hear any lazy ""Russell has the ball the entire time"" arguments. 

While Russ doesn't have his historic VORP or box score plus minus he had last year he's still markedly ahead of Kyrie (8.0/6.4 to 6.4/4.1). Kyrie is 12th in VORP and 8th in BPM while Russ is 3rd and 4th respectively. 


**The random shit**: Did you know Russell is *5th in total rebounds this year*? He has more rebounds than AD, Giannis, Lebron, Embiid & Jokic. I don't give a damn about a few ""rebound hunting boards per game"" this is a 6'3 POINT GUARD being top 5 in the league in rebounds. 

Brodie has nearly 100 assists more than second place. (717 to Lebron's 631... 3rd highest is Harden with 542). That's a ridiculous lead especially for a guy putting up 25+ ppg and thought of as ""selfish"". He's one of the league best passers and playmakers and miles better at either than Kyrie. (Remember the usage rates are nearly identical and Kyrie puts up less than half of Russ' assists).


**Defense**: Russ is *3rd in defensive win shares*. It's a weird stat with a lot of factors going into it but 3rd is 3rd. 

Russell is 4th in steals. He's 7th in SPG. Kyrie isn't even top 50. 

Basically on defense neither guy is considered good. Russ is bigger and doesn't get killed on the block or abused in switches as easily. Russ also creates more turnovers (most times leading directly to a fast break basket) and absolutely soars for rebounds any other point guard in the league could only dream of. I'd give the definite edge to Russ in terms of defense. 


**Team Success**: This certainly matters but with the injuries the Celtics have right now they may very well only be 3 games ahead in the win column after tonight. It's certainly fair to point out OKC is in the much more difficult conference and don't forget about the divisions. The division opponents you play more than any other team... OKC has Portland, Utah, Denver and Minnesota... all playoff caliber teams in division. Boston has Toronto, Philly and the lowly Nets/Knicks. Boston is 10-3 in division. Meanwhile the northwest division is a bloodbath.


All things considered if OKC finishes <5-7 games behind Boston while playing in the much harder conference with the toughest division I'd call that a push. 


**Health**:

This is the biggest factor for me and clearly puts Russ ahead. Westbrook has played in 97% percent of his teams games (70/72). Kyrie has missed 10 games (60/70) and will likely miss a handful more if not the rest of the regular season. With 12 games to go and the Celts up 6 games on the Cavs and down 5 on the Raps it wouldn't surprise me if Kyrie plays at most a couple of ""knock the rust off"" games to finish the year. Meanwhile the West will likely come down to the final game. 

So we have one guy likely playing in 79-80 games and the other playing 60-65. That's a BIG DEAL. I get you can be dominant and not play the entire year (see Joel Embiid ROY debate just last year) but in regards to ALL NBA missing a quarter of the season is just too much in a discussion this close.  

Edit: So Kyrie could play as early as this week but he's risking getting reinjured and would be playing less than 100% anyway. He's getting a second opinion and if he gets the screws out he's basically done for the regular season.

https://twitter.com/TonyMassarotti/status/976198335433465857


**Highlight Reel**: It shouldn't matter in terms of All NBA but honestly guys, who's more fun to watch? Kyrie gets buckets. Westbrook makes plays no other player in the league can make. Kyrie can finish as well as anyone but NOBODY can get to the bucket like Russ. He'll turn a 1 on 3 into an and 1. He'll leap over centers to grab second chance points. He just has so many more ""holy shit that stat line!"" games or ""dear god what a move/rebound/steal/hustle play"". This isn't meant to discredit Kyrie either. He probably has the leagues best handles and is an unreal shot maker. Other than basically iso scoring he doesn't hold a candle to the incredible things Russ can do.

**In Summary**: Both guys can absolutely light it up and carry a team by scoring. Both guys have huge usage rates and the teams runs through them especially at the end of games. 

Kyrie *is much more efficient*. That's the biggest factor in his favor. Aside from that though...

Russ is not just a better passer, he's *leading the league by a wide margin*. 

Kyrie may not even be a league average rebounder for a PG. Russell on the other hand is *a historically great rebounder for his position* and stud on the boards regardless of position. 


Basically other than Russ being less efficient than Kyrie he's better in every regard. FTR, BPM, VORP by a solid amount and steals, assists and rebounds by leaps and bounds. If Boston had continued to win at it's early season pace and Kyrie not gotten injured then i'd certainly buy into a pro Kyrie argument but Kyrie might play 20 less games and while both teams have had ups and downs when the dust settles OKC could very well be only a few games back of Boston despite the schedules. 


Edit: Last point. Kyrie is sick ok... don't come at me with some ""ur a h8tr crap"". I like Kyrie's game. Russ is just a better player. 

When talking about top 5 or so players its' Lebron, Harden, Curry, KD with Russ, AD Giannis in some order. When was the last time you saw a post, heard a podcast or argued with a buddy that seriously believed Kyrie is better than Russ. He's top 10-15 or so for sure. But this is the ALL NBA TEAM. One of the biggest historical markers we have. Simply put whether this year or 10, 20 years from now when you look at this season as a whole and ask yourself honestly ""who was a better player in 2018 Westbrook or Irving"" you would have a tough time reasoning Irving.

"I was at the game on Sunday and just wanted to say a couple things:

- You guys played great and definitely deserved to win that game

- Russ is insane, truly a treat to see live. He seems unstoppable when he drives that much.

- Melo seems to have found his role. Doesn't seem like the ball sticks too much in his hands and has become a bit of a spot up shooter. Which I'd imagine is what most of you want

- Finally I think im in love with Steven Adams, such a great underrated player. One of my favourites in the NBA now and I think he's a big reason you guys will always have a chance to beat the Warriors.","Raptors fan here... I was at the game on Sunday and just wanted to say a couple things:

Russell Westbrook needs to average 12.1 rebounds a game for the final ten games to average a triple double for the season. This is completely feasible. He’s on a 5 game trip dub tear right now.

"Maybe I’m just a little biased because I really want A3nes to do well on this team, but I feel like he has really stepped it up in the past couple of games. He’s not fouling as much on the defensive end, and he’s also making some great defensive plays (a couple of blocks recently if I recall correctly). On the offensive end, his shooting has been okay, but he has also kept the ball moving. It’s not necessarily passing, but he isn’t playing as just a catch and shoot player with the bench unit. I think that’s been really useful in helping the bench be more successful. He also just looks like he is full of energy out there. We all talk about Westbrook’s drive, and now Brewer’s raw energy, but Abrines looks like he’s giving it 110% every time he steps onto the court. 

He’s not the best player, but I think what he has been bringing to the table recently is perfect for the Thunder.","Has anyone else noticed huge improvement from Abrines?

"I'm not gonna lie I severely underestimated the impact Corey Brewer has on this Thunder team.  When Roberson went down, the Thunder struggled to adjust to Roberson's absence on both offense and especially defense.  They were a different team.  Roberson's length and elite defensive abilities along with his constant off ball movement perfectly complimented WB and PG.

Brewer IMO has been the perfect Roberson substitute so far.  

Is Brewer as good as Roberson defensively?  No he's not.  But Brewer's defense has been good enough and pairs perfectly with WB and PG.  He averages 2 steals a game with the Thunder allowing the Thunder to wreak havoc again on defense.

Offensively is where Brewer definitely outshines Roberson.  Brewer has shown he can hit that corner 3, cuts just as well, as is a speed demon the fast break.  WB and Brewer might be the fastest backcourt on the fast break in the league.  Brewer has also been able to hit his free throws.

I originally thought starting Heustis saved the season but I started realize Heustis serves best as a defensive specialist off the bench.  Outside of Heustis, the wing player defense off the bench drops dramatically.  Now with Brewer, that is not the case.  Your GM pulled off another with this Brewer signing.  I am excited to see how your team rides this momentum going into the playoffs.  If this team manages to reach 50 wins with the hardest finishing schedule in the league, I am will be confident enough to say they can beat any team in the playoffs.

"Small sample size but thought that was really interesting. In that same span, the only team doing better has been Utah at a ridiculous 85.8 rating holy shit.

OKC is still a top 10 defensive team for this season 104.2 (good for 9th). Real contenders in the top 10:

Raptors - 102.7 / GSW - 103.7 / HOU - 104.1 / BOS - 101.5

For more cherry picking (lol), in our December to January 27 (the date of the Ronerson injury) stint where we seemed to get it together, we only had a 105.1 rating, good for 8th in that span, just below 104.9 GSW (in this span we also had a 109.9 ORTG, good for 5th).

Anywho, for March, we're 103.8 DRTG (good for 7th in that span) to go along with a 109.4 ORTG (good for 14th). Ideally, we'll keep trending in the same direction. Tonight will be a great test to see if we're for real or not.

"Now I understand that this could be a little far fetched, but i have a crazy theory about the Thunder. From what I’ve noticed, they play well when they need, or feel the need to beat a team. Golden State Warriors for example. But what if They are downplaying what they can actually make happen. Paul George losing the 3-point contest could play a role in their plan. And maybe we’ll also get hoodie Melo as well. From my understanding, they have a ton of talent and potential on their team and they could be just keeping it low until they get into the playoffs. It would be amazing to just witness them take a ring home as Legendary underdogs.

"If the playoffs started tomorrow and the seeds stayed how they are we'd be the 4th seed and would have to play New Orleans. Then the next round we would play Houston. Making 3rd isn't that much better , we'd have to play in my opinion a tougher opponent, the Wolves and then play the 2nd seed GS. I just want to know what everyone's opinions are on the best spot to play for and if 3rd seed is worth it (banking on the fact we can't get the 2nd seed).

In my opinion 4th is the best option because we'd have an ""easier"" opponent in the pelicans than the wolves. Basically would you rather play the 1.) Pels first round, Rockets second round or 2.) Wolves first round, GS second 
round.

"Or is it just a fluke.

I feel like theyve stepped it up recently, but theres no way of knowing for sure. 

Also, collison might need a few more minutes off our bench if hes gonna play like that. 

Im 100% sure westbrook and PG will be ready af when playoffs come. Melo is yet to be determined, I very much hope he is considering this may be his last real chance at a deep playoff run besides joining a lebron led team. 

But if our bench finally turns the corner and becomes a good bench this team will go places. 

For example, imagine if pg and melo were shooting as good as theyve done during the high points of this season? Or if Pg was shooting his season average and melo scored at least his average ppg along with this kind of bench we had...

This team can really put the pieces together if the bench continues to step up. I only hope its not a fluke.

The team is screwed they literally have no cap space, no assets to help win a finals & for OKC to really contend they need to add another all star but that is impossible with the cap space. A lot of teams may look to sign & trade George this offseason as well. But if you also look at it LA may be more exciting for him. One of the best city’s to live in, Hometown, Young great core group that will be on top soon, & Exciting Laker team that he could lead and not be second string to Russ plus they can offer him a Max contract. Idk if I’m stressing but everyday it looks like Paul is going to leave OKC for the Lakers.

"Look at Houston, They let Harden & CP3 handle the offense while surrounding them with 3 & D players, this has kept them really successful, they are best team in the league (standings wise) & are a legit threat to Golden State. Your bench is your weakest link & I feel like PG & Russ would’ve been so much more successful if they had more 3&D players with them, both of them have an ability to break down the defense & with shooters you can’t really help that much. Melo is out of his prime, slow, inconsistent, not a factor on the defensive end & the worse part is basically giving him a lot of dead money if he opts in. This is just my take & I wanna hear what OKC fans think ","Hot Take: You guys shouldn’t have traded for Melo, should’ve looked for more 3 & D players.

"I've been chewing on this for a few weeks. 

We had Scott Brooks. That was in the good ole days when we had KD and Russ as our 2 man show. Scott Brooks was often criticized for his use of ""Scotts Secrit Plays"" which was basically ""give the ball to KD or Russ and let them ISO"". We also had a better bench and supporting cast in those days so the flaws of going to ISO in tight situations could be better hidden, not to mention KD is unguardable and one of the best shooters of all time so that doesn't hurt. 

Now, Scott and KD are gone. Russ' shooting has *never* been his strength. It has always been his ability to pick apart a defense, or just drive in with raw power and get it done. Now, last year we saw Russ hit an ungodly amount of clutch shots and I think it has skewed our perception of him as a shooter. He has never had a high TS%. This season isn't so much his shooting falling off, but more just regressing to the mean imo. His free throws is another story, but that's unimportant for this post. 

So last year we didn't play team ball either. It was a ton of Russ iso which resulted in a top 5 all time season for any player in league history. Russ went bananas. We didn't have high expectations so we weren't being *too* critical of the ISO ball. In this sub last year we all thought ""That's what we have to do. Nobody else can do anything."" Regardless of all that, last season was a lot of fun, but the ISO was still heavily present. 

Now, in the offseason, we literally sign King ISO and Prince ISO to go along with our own ISO King and all of us seem to be confused as to why we run so much ISO. It is my opinion that the Thunder front office absolutely 100% wants to play ISO ball. There's just no way that we've been accidentally playing ISO ball for damn near 5 years. It can't be just the coaches fault. It can't be just the players. I think it is and has been intentional from the top of our organization. For some reason, I have no idea why, they want us to play ISO ball. That's why KD left. He said it himself. The system isn't good. 

I'm thunder for life, but I'm sick of ISO ball. The league has evolved to team ball and 3 pointers and we've been left behind in ISO land running nothing but pick and rolls and post ups trying to sham god our way into a 1st round exit. I'm not being reactionary or negative about our team. I'm just calling it as I see it. The Thunder has been and will continue to be an ISO ball organization, and until we move past it I don't think we will win a championship. We have a player capable of dropping 20 dimes in one game and I just don't think we're running the right system for him *in the slightest*. Worst of all, we're stuck with King ISO next season because nobody else will pay him what we *have* to pay him. 

I personally hope Melo goes ring chasing and PG goes to LA so we can try to build a spot up shooter and defense lineup around Russ. I hope BD is fired and an actual coach is brought in instead of his ABC 123 scarecrow lookin ass. I hope everyone will wake up and see that this playstyle and coaching style doesn't work. Everyone in this sub can see that, why can't the ownership?

I'm sorry if this post is reactionary or seems like I hate the team. I promise I dont. I try to be as positive as possible in each game thread and I'm the 1st guy to tell people to give us time to get in a groove when we're down instead of saying we're gonna lose. I just don't think this experiment has worked, and I think the disease of ISO ball goes much further than our players and coaches. I think it goes all the way to Presti and the ownership group.","Rant/writeup: Is ISO ball a symptom of our coaching, or is it a symptom of our GM and our FO?

"Our identity going into this season was supposes to be the new Big 3. But from tip off on day one, it became evident that the Thunder's chosen identity in a league of super teams wasn't an ""even better"" superteam, it was Defense.

"**2017-18 Salary Cap**: $99,093,000

**1. Trade Alex Abrines and Patrick Patterson for Danny Green.** 

**Green**: one year left (‘18/‘19) with a player option in his contract worth $10,000,000 exactly.
**Abrines**: one year left as well in his contract worth $5,455,236. 
**Patterson**: two years left on his contract. In the ‘18/‘19 season, he is guaranteed $5,451,600. In the ‘19/‘20 season, he is guaranteed $5,711,200 with a player option. 

**Pros**: At an acceptable 30-years-old, Danny Green is averaging 1.5 catch-and-shoot 3s per game on 40.1% which would prove to guarantee quick points and chip away at our irritating habit of dribbling around before taking a shot. In fact, Green is at his best from deep without dribbling at all. I’m not the best at finding defensive statistics, but Danny’s ‘17/‘18 DBPM is 2.3 so he can defend. Financially, this move would knock off $906,836 in the ‘18/‘19 season and $5,711,200 in the ‘19/‘20 season. 

**Cons**: Two players for one and no draft picks (the Spurs don’t have any) is never ideal. As far as Danny Green’s age, 30 is neither old nor young which is tricky and potentially detrimental if he were to worsen with age and we re-sign him. 

**Why would the Spurs do that?** Alex Abrines is a young player with room to grow and an already serviceable 3-point shot. He’s shown flashes of defensive ability and athleticism that can be molded to Pop’s standards. Patrick Patterson is only 28 with a proven role-player resume and enough left in the tank to be apart of a potential future San Antonio trade. 

**2. Stretch Carmelo Anthony’s contract or trade him to a contender he’s approved.** 

This one’s difficult. While the road has been bumpy at times, Carmelo Anthony is still Carmelo Anthony. But money is tight and we can’t have ‘Melo’s contract weighing down on us, preventing future opportunities. It is more likely that ‘Melo will not agree to stretch his contract so let’s explore a trade option. 

**Toronto Raptors**: While they’re not as impressive as the some contendors, the Raptors are not to be overlooked as they’ve shown promise over the last few years. Toronto is also a lot closer to home for ‘Melo and the city’s fun. I say **Carmelo Anthony for C.J. Miles and Pascal Siakam**. 

Both Miles and Siakam are signed until the ‘19/‘20 season, but since we’re trying to figure out next year only for the time being, here are their salaries for ‘18/‘19 season. 

**Miles**: $8,333,333
**Siakam**: $1,544,951

**Pros**: C.J. Miles is another threat from deep at 39% (his current statistics: 10.3/0.7/1.9). Pascal Siakam is extremely young (23) and another big man that would help us off the bench. Can he defend? Yes. He’s also averaging 7 points and 4.5 rebounds.

**Cons**: Miles isn’t young and is not the best defender. Siakam cannot shoot from 3. 

Continuing on.

**3. Trade Kyle Singler, Dakari Johnson, and Terrance Ferguson for Justin Holiday and Robin Lopez.**

Obviously, we all want to get rid of Singler, but not everyone wants to see Ferguson go. Why do I not mind letting another team have him? We’re in win-now mode even if we re-sign Paul George and Ferguson becoming a star on another team is a chance I’m willing to take to snag a ring. Dakari has been thrown into the mix because he’s young, to somewhat match salaries, and despite Ferguson’s talents, a Ferguson/Singler combination is not enough in my opinion talent-wise. 

Holiday and Lopez are both free agents at the end of next season. Chicago is not going to become a contender overnight so I imagine their front office is going to want something in return for them as opposed to letting them walk after the 2019 season. 

‘18/‘19 salaries for everyone aforementioned:
**Singler**: $4,996,000
**Johnson**: $1,378,242
**Ferguson**: $2,118,840
OKC total: $8,493,082

**Holiday**: $4,384,616
**Lopez**: $14,357,750
Chicago total: $18,742,366

**Pros**: Justin Holiday would be a fantastic bench shooting guard and obviously no one would complain about Lopez coming in after Adams. Their statistics speak for themselves (Holiday this year: 13/2.3/4.5 on 37/37/82 splits, Lopez: 12.3 points and 4.7 rebounds with both offensive and defensive rebound averages almost equal). 

**Cons**: Expensive. 

**4. Sign Trevor Ariza if Paul George does not re-sign.**

Ariza is only signed for the remainder of this season and therefore could be signed in the offseason with a different salary. His ‘17/‘18 salary: $7,420,912

**Pros**: Trevor Ariza is a 39% shooter from deep averaging 12 points and an okay defender with veteran presence, size. At 32, Ariza could possibly be acquired for even less than he’s making this year due to age. 

**Cons**: Ariza isn’t getting any younger. 

With everything into consideration, our salaries next year would look like this so far: 

**Starters**
Russell Westbrook (PG): $35,350,000
Danny Green (SG): $10,000,000
Paul George (assuming he re-signs) (SF): $20,703,384 
Trevor Ariza (assuming Paul George does not re-sign) (SF): $7,420,912
Andre Roberson (PF): $10,000,000 
Steven Adams (C): $24,157,303

**Bench**
Justin Holiday (SG): $4,384,616
C.J. Miles (SF): $8,333,333
Pascal Siakam (PF): $1,544,951
Robin Lopez (C): $14,357,750

Felton, Grant, Huestis, and Collison are not signed for next year so I obviously I did not include them. 

Before these changes, our guaranteed players for next year with George ran a price of **$137,538,745**. After these changes, our hypothetical lineup next year with George runs a price of **$128,831,337**. Without George, but with Ariza? That price is ** $115,548,865**. 

With these changes, we have either **$8,707,408 (with PG13)** or **$21,989,880 (without PG13)** that we previously didn’t have to resign Grant, Huestis, and Felton or another bench PG. 

Feel free to correct anything I might have incorrect or throw in other suggestions. I realize this isn’t going to 100% fix everything, but it’s a start. Thank you for reading. 

","My Proposition for Offseason Moves **2017-18 Salary Cap**: $99,093,000

**1. Trade Alex Abrines and Patrick Patterson for Danny Green.** 

**Green**: one year left (‘18/‘19) with a player option in his contract worth $10,000,000 exactly.
**Abrines**: one year left as well in his contract worth $5,455,236. 
**Patterson**: two years left on his contract. In the ‘18/‘19 season, he is guaranteed $5,451,600. In the ‘19/‘20 season, he is guaranteed $5,711,200 with a player option. 

**Pros**: At an acceptable 30-years-old, Danny Green is averaging 1.5 catch-and-shoot 3s per game on 40.1% which would prove to guarantee quick points and chip away at our irritating habit of dribbling around before taking a shot. In fact, Green is at his best from deep without dribbling at all. I’m not the best at finding defensive statistics, but Danny’s ‘17/‘18 DBPM is 2.3 so he can defend. Financially, this move would knock off $906,836 in the ‘18/‘19 season and $5,711,200 in the ‘19/‘20 season. 

**Cons**: Two players for one and no draft picks (the Spurs don’t have any) is never ideal. As far as Danny Green’s age, 30 is neither old nor young which is tricky and potentially detrimental if he were to worsen with age and we re-sign him. 

**Why would the Spurs do that?** Alex Abrines is a young player with room to grow and an already serviceable 3-point shot. He’s shown flashes of defensive ability and athleticism that can be molded to Pop’s standards. Patrick Patterson is only 28 with a proven role-player resume and enough left in the tank to be apart of a potential future San Antonio trade. 

**2. Stretch Carmelo Anthony’s contract or trade him to a contender he’s approved.**

"Exclamation slam from the Phoenix game earlier, screaming while hanging onto the rim just gives me goosebumps: https://imgur.com/a/4RPbl. Really captures the feral nature of the Brodie. 

Silly question but I've been trying to save dope photos of Russ especially some iconic ones. Is there an (un/)official gallery uploaded by the NBA, the Thunder, or any third party where we can download wallpapers in the highest resolution possible? Specific moments I'm looking for:

"The reason these games are so close is because of our defense allows players to get into a good rhythm, so they start making shots even we do start playing good defense. Melo can’t defend. Seriously watch him on D. He doesn’t rotate well and he’s so slow that he has to leave so much space so he doesn’t get blown by. He’s our Curry, meaning that teams trying to take advantage of him by getting the switch, but he’s scoring 17 ppg on 16 shots. Those are rookie numbers. Seriously there is no excuse for that. He should not be playing 32 minutes while PPat is only getting 15 when he can actually defend. And when do start well, Melo starts going iso every time he gets the ball. For example, when Russ sat at the end of the first vs Dallas, PG and Melo were still there. Two times in a row Melo walks up the floor, iso, brick, and doesn’t get back on D and they  cut the lead down by 5. With no Roberson we NEED a solid defender to set the tone, not a liability who also can’t score.","We need start setting the tone defensively.

"I'm pretty excited about the addition of Brewer so I looked into his stats, here's a few things I noticed:

1. He's only 31 (almost 32), I thought he was in his mid 30's like Tony allen.

2. While it's true that he's not a strong 3pt shooter (career 28%), he only attempts 2.2 threes per 36min, so he seems to know his limits and doesn't shoot them often, for reference, Roberson shoots 1.2 per 36.

3. Around the basket 0-3ft he's a career 61.7% shooter/finisher, Robes is 66.3% for his career and Pg13 is at a career 62.7%, so not bad at all.

4. With his height (6'9"") and length , he's capable of playing the 2, 3 and *sometimes* the 4 (he's a bit too skinny to bang down low with true 4's), he's yet another long, athletic, switchy athlete on our roster.

5. He's regarded as a hustle/energy type of defender, where as roberson is more of an iq/stay on your hip the entire night defender. 

My synopsis (if you care) is that he's a lengthy athlete who is at least a capable defender unlike abrines/ferguson who can put the ball on the floor to score (unlike abrines/huestis/ferguson) and gives us even more length. He's not a strong jump shooter (or catch and shoot) in really any area of the floor, but seems to know this and scores in transition or on cuts. He honestly reminds me of Jerami Grant if he was more perimeter oriented instead of a springy 4 who can shoot a little bit. Bottom line is that he helps fill the gaps we have at the 2 between abrines/ferguson/huestis.

My hopes are that we can attach him to the other teams best perimeter scorer and let scoring take a backseat like roberson did and let PG13 rest for a bit. At the absolute very least he's an extra defender we can use against harden/klay, etc, another body is another body.

I'm not knocking just T-Ferg, but as soon as we got a big lead on Dallas we played a straight Felton-Abrines-Ferg-Grant-Patterson line-up which we NEVER do and let them back in it. We can't not stagger in the playoffs. This is just Donovan doing dumb shit.

And then every game ends up close in the fourth quarter where we expect the big 3 to clutch it out.   
  
Can't we just have a set rotation with set minutes and then if we're blowing teams out in the fourth then run garbage time line-ups?

"I was one of the ""reactionary"" post guys that was hoping BD would get the boot up the pooper after our teams woeful start to the season. 

Just wondering how everyone feels about him now. The last ""how do you feel post"" came about after our win streak so it was hardly representative. I feel like it's a better time to assess now. 

I've been a 3 year Billy denier - so I'll try and present some neutral points along with the bad: 

- He has had some success in establishing a lesser role for Melo whilst keeping him happy. 

- Our ball movement and spacing is better. 

- His shitty experimental rotations are the reason why we dropped some easy games (at least 5). We could easily be a comfortable 3 seed at this point. He still seems to be experimenting (maybe a moot point because of injuries). 

- Seemingly ignores lineup data (Melo was statistically better with the bench unit than PG). 

- Our permiter D still sucks. 

- We still constantly switch our bigs onto guards and watch them get burned without making adjustments (see upcoming Portland game). 

- Refuses to bench players that are playing terribly and single handedly blowing the game (Abrines on a number of occasions, Ferguson a few times) etc. 

- Doesn't seem to have a contingency plan if Adams gets injured. Dakari seemed to earn his minutes but has sat next to Singler since. 

- Actually seems like a nice guy and always has intersting things to say in interviews etc. 

Like I said, I'm biased af. Would be good for some others to assess amd maybe draw some more positives. I'm not calling for his head anymore, I just hope he can work with the team on the above before playoffs so we can make a decent run. 

P.S If my opinion is different to your, keep it civil. We are all Thunderbros.","Billy Donovan I was one of the ""reactionary"" post guys that was hoping BD would get the boot up the pooper after our teams woeful start to the season.

"In his 20 minutes, Huestis had a plus/minus rating of -1 which sounds underwhelming but comparatively, Melo and Melo were -26, Abrines was -30, Russ was -19, Adams was -6 George was -12.

I believe Huestis ' defense in the starting lineup is going to be key to us having any chance moving into the playoffs. What do you all think about the possibility he receives more minutes in the coming schedule?

After Dre's injury I've been searching for some optimism to suggest we can hang with the Rockets or Warriors. I definitely think we have a chance against any other Western conference team in a playoff round match-up but unless Huestis is given more opportunity and succeeds within a more substantial role, I am concerned about what options we have left or what tricks BD has up his sleeve.

"I'll be honest, I didn't expect to win last night's game but I thought it would have gone much different. I thought GSW would come out and smack us in the mouth and we'd never be able to catch up.

GSW had some better energy than the other games, but they didn't break it open until late in the 3rd. And they ran up the score because PG couldn't make a single shot as he manned the 4th quarter unit.

"League needs to do something about this...

Watched the replay 10 times. Zaza ""stumbles"" untouched and fell straight onto Westbrook's legs with his 250 pound body. If you watch the replay, Zaza clearly had complete balance, and he saw Westbrook on the ground and magically lost his balance. He is a master of making his dirty intent look as if it were a game play.

Pop has came out and legit named 10 dirty plays he's committed over the course of 3-4 years. For Pop to come out and trash someone, you know its gotta be bad.

Oh, and for those Warrior fans saying it was a game play, he did not try to break his fall, nothing. He saw Westy's legs and took aim. Just like he magically got right under Kawhi with the most unorthodox close I have ever seen in my life, he got this one right. Unlucky for him, Westy is fine.

League needs to legit do something about this. Its pathetic that the ""mighty"" Golden State Warriors who have assembled a ""dynasty"" have a bounty hunter on their team to intentionally go out and injure other teams star players.. just sad. 

You never hope injury on anyone, but I legit hope Zaza has a career ending injury soon. He needs to be kicked out of this league.

"So with the news that Rose's agent has OKC on the phone and that we're interested in Noah (we obviously want to be the Oklahoma City Knicks), would you try to buyout Dakari or some other roster spot to get these guys?

We're also interested in Tony Allen and Ilyasova (but last I heard, Ily wasn't into us). Also Bogut is available.

We owe Dakari about 2.1m. I figure we'd sign a SG and a C for that combined.

I don't think it takes us 'over the top' in a sense of replacing Robes but I do kinda like the idea of this bench line-up

Ray/Rose(or Allen)/Grant/2Pat/Noah(or Bogut)

I like having two ball handlers that can create on a broken play. If Noah has any bit of defense in him, that'd be awesome next to 2Pat, who can stretch the floor. Jerami is always a mismatch nightmare wherever he plays and his post up game is so much better.

It leaves Ferg on the bench (hopefully), and Abrines sees less minutes. We've got a decent amount of defense (moreso in the frontcourt).

Injuries for anyone left on the market are going to be a thing. So my question is stand pat or get some guys to help us make a run. Do you think it's enough tho?","Would you buy out Dakari to sign a SG + a C?

"We could get him for extremely cheap. The FA market is garbage right now. He can play SG, we literally have rookies starting at the 2 right now so we cant say that its not an improvement. 

He wants to play for a contender and knows this might be his last shot. He's gonna play as well as hes able to. He can also play with the bench and be competent. Our bench guys just seem scared 75% of the time but I can tell you D rose will shoot that shit unafraid. 

I think hes the best thing we can get right now unless Tony Allen get 4 years younger and is no longer recovering from a broken leg. 

We also wouldnt have to deal with Rose next year if it doesnt work out, but I think its definitely worth a shot considering the massive hole at the 2 now.

Houston isn't happy he's hurt, but they are feasting on the wolves at the moment, and with a vengeance.

But as soon as he was off the floor, they tried to beat us.  They are first and foremost competitors, and they were willing to exploit any advantage given to them.

We're not a bad team. We've trotted out some awful lineups at awful times tho. Ferg was a -30 in 13 minutes. Imagine if we gave someone else those minutes.

Edit: Abrines played 7 minutes last night to Ferguson 13 minutes. Huestis, a starter, played 15 minutes, while Grant played 25 off the bench.

"If it doesnt happen, ill bet its been explored or will be.

Pop can get the most out of melo and can likely develop ferguson to the point where this might eventually turn the trade SA's favor, especially if kawhi is on the downside because of injury, but ridding of melo might be worth it.

Man that would be a monster defense with pg, kawhi, and adams, and next year robes. and because of a higher fg% kawhi should be first option on offense if healthy. Sacrificing a little bit of future for dominance now though.

The downside... maybe pop wouldnt trade kawhi to the west. What do you do with both Gay and Melo (well they can switch with each other between sf and pf) and put la at center for a small ball lineup. Most of all, the spurs wouldnt be tanking but they would probably be giving up a chance for the championship until melo is aged out or gone. I dont know if thats in pops dna, but having melo and ferguson and assets is better than kawhi not playing, and alot of espn people say that relationship is fraying. 

If i was  presti i would roll the dice on kawhis health, considering he is actually cleared to play this year but chooses not to. Maybe a move to okc will change his mind. Salary cap and the tax are gonna be huge for okc but it was already that way next year for them, and could they keep both pg and kawhi, and also adams 25m also. Tax bill over 200m.

"Hey guys. Not really a Thunder fan, though I've been watching a lot of your games this year. I'm a Laker guy.

I've been watching KD interact with Russ, Lebron, etc, and just develop as a person over this season. He seems to be up for the challenge of restoring his image.

If Paul George leaves, I can honestly say that I would love to see KD go back home to the Thunder and try to win you guys a chip, like Lebron did when he went back to Cleveland. Maybe he demands some changes in the coaching staff or otherwise, but I just can't see him sitting in Golden State and not doing something about all the character questions that arose from that decision.

Furthermore, the Warriors need to lose some talent anyway, given their cap situation -- either Klay Thompson or Draymond Green is going in the next few years, so I can see him feeling like this would leave both fanbases satisfied.","Is it possible that KD is planning a Lebron-esque return?

"we have 3 days of nothingness. let's debate.

Let me first start off by saying I still think PG will give us a 1+1 --> there's no real rush to get to LA right now, they'll have most of that cap space next year. i also think if he sees LBJ give the cavs another chance, he may give OKC one. again, Lonzo/BI are really talented guys but they're not ready now. we could get into a convo about whether or not PG wants to win or not, but I think he was a lot upset in Indiana cuz they weren't winning and they pretty much took everything away from him that won.

Worst case scenario: Pg + Melo opt out -> Melo does it because he realizes he's not worth the money and decides to go ring chasing to a place with money/better team available.

Basically leaves us with another MVP Russ season, but I think we have way better pieces esp if Melo frees up enough money to bring Grant/Huestis/Felton back.

"So many ""lol stop being so reactionary"" posts/comments, but, although this sub has overreacted to many things earlier on, this is not one of those times. 

&nbsp;

* The Thunder bench is a very serious problem. It is not good by any metric. Terrance Ferguson is not ready. Huestis isn't ready. Alex Abrines *should* be exactly what OKC needs, and maybe post-ASB, he'll find his rhythm again. But it's hard to bank on that, and none of these players shows serious signs of major growth.

&nbsp;


* OKC has lost 6 of their last 9, and nearly blew a 22 point lead to one of the worst teams in basketball last night. The Thunder are currently tied in standings with LAC (5-1 since the trade) in the loss column for the 9th seed (with the Jazz on an 11 game winning streak at 10th).

&nbsp;



* OKC has lost a DPOY starting SG, and cannot replace his impact. Our sample size with him out both before his first injury, and after his last one, is very telling. OKC plays very poorly without Roberson, and he was very key in wins against teams like GS/HOU. Replicating the win we recently had against GS will be hard to do without Robes in a 7 game series. 

&nbsp;



* *Kyle Wagner from FiveThirtyEight writes:* ""Since Roberson went out, Oklahoma City’s defensive rating has been 112.3, **which would rank 27th in the league**, ahead of only the Cleveland Cavaliers, Sacramento Kings and Phoenix Suns.""

&nbsp;

* No one was buying what Presti was selling at the deadline, and that's not good. He's an excellent GM, and his track record shows that. If he held on to Ferguson in hopes of him being a good player 3 years down the line, I think that's a mistake, but we don't know *what* happened, and there's nothing that can be done now. The Thunder needed a big off the bench and bench scoring *before* Roberson went down. A trade allows opportunity to receive multiple players, and with essentially one season left with Huestis and Grant (due to money they'll get and our cap issues nest season), it would have been great to ""exchange"" rentals for better ones. (I'll note that Grant looks great right now, though his BPM is not great).

&nbsp;


* We have 1 open roster spot that likely belongs to Tony Allen. Sam Presti hasn't been known for buying out players. Ideally, a Tony Allen/Bogut/? pickup on the market could help plug holes, but again, we have one slot.

&nbsp;



**Now look**. I'm (probably dangerously) obsessed with this team, more than most of my hobbies. It's probably unhealthy, the amount of research I do on them and how closely I follow the NBA. I am ride-or-die with OKC. But you/me/we HAVE to be realistic. This season is *massively* important and many insiders **really** believe that PG will re-sign with a successful playoff run. 
But these circumstances the Thunder finds themselves in now, they're different than earlier on. This season is different because it has massive implications on the next 5 years of this franchise. The path forward before was ""give them time."" The path forward now is ""change...something.""

&nbsp;

**IT DOES NOT MAKE YOU A ""BAD FAN"" OR A BANDWAGONER TO ACKNOWLEDGE THESE THINGS.** It makes you a fan with awareness. That does not mean we can't be hopeful.

&nbsp;

*I think the ASB will be great for the Thunder. I think rotations will be tuned, I think Presti will be active in the buyout market, and I think a permanent lineup shuffle will be in the works. I think (hot take) that Melo off the bench will be a conversation that will be had internally.*

&nbsp;


**TL:DR;** I think good things are ahead of the OKC Thunder post-All Star Break, but they're not guaranteed, and things are not good right now. And that's perfectly ok to be aware of. There's a line between over-reacting and under-reacting.

"Ever since Roberson went out our boys have clearly had some growing pains. Specifically, our defense has struggled to adapt. Simply replacing Roberson with Abrines or TFerg in the starting lineup has yet to work. Starting Huestis seemed to help but he struggles on the offensive end. My question is why haven't we attempted to start Jerami or at least give him more playing time? He always seems to be very effective in his limited minutes, providing a spark and holding his own on defense. Starting him would also allow us to slide PG to the 2 to fill Roberson's spot.

"So the new Cavs are no joke. This might be a bit established by now, but OKC's issues don't majorly lie on the starters but rather the bench. If Melo is only getting around 15 points, Russ and PG can step in and get around 25 each.

But you can't rely on just starters and the fact that Adams just played 41 minutes against the Cavs is a testament of this, the bench is where most inconsistency lasts because the only consistent bench player (and you might disagree) is **Grant**. Abrines had an amazing game against the Grizzlies but it seems as if Billy D will have to switch the starting SG every game because they can't seem to contribute enough offence-wise on a day-to-day basis. 

Felton had a good run during the winning streaks and he is still decent but when 3 other bench players who all get more than 10 minutes of playing time get 0 points and as a collective get the same amount of rebounds as Westbrook (sorry this is a bit irrelevant) it makes you wonder.

Edit: Another Grizzlies game, maybe Melo and Russ can have an easier re-integration game against them before ASW Thunder Up!","Random rant: The Bench needs some milk So the new Cavs are no joke. This might be a bit established by now, but OKC's issues don't majorly lie on the starters but rather the bench. If Melo is only getting around 15 points, Russ and PG can step in and get around 25 each.

"I'll be honest and say that I've always been more so a fan of players rather than teams. So Russ was the initial pull to watching OKC, but that quickly changed. I saw a team with an immense amount of talent, but my love for the team grew even more after KD's departure. 

I saw them as the underdogs. A team that stuck together through adversity and a group of guys fighting to prove the naysayers wrong. A locker room with grit, passion and heart. Guys that came out there and sacrificed their bodies every night regardless of the narrative that Russ was carrying the team on his back. I saw guys with incredible work ethic and toughness.

I've also realized that I'm drawn to defense. While everyone else would oh and ah at a guy splashing a 3 pointer, I get more excited over a block or steal. I just admire the effort and discipline it takes for a team to be great on that side of the ball. 

I've never had an appreciation for an entire roster the way I do with OKC. I obviously have my favorites in Russ, Dre and Steve. I like to call them the OGs of the team. Lol I feel like I can relate to most of the players though. It also just feels great to support a team that embodies what sports should be all about; a brotherhood.

"Any skills or qualities that you feel the players don't get recognized enough for or isn't talked about at all. 

Russ: His leadership role. It says a lot when a guy can come out on the court and control the entire tempo of a team. The team usually feeds off his energy. If he's having an exceptional night on the court, his teammates will usually elevate their game (very obvious in those GSW games this season). 

Dre: His dunks. Im a chick, so I'll never be able to dunk and I'm extremely jealous. Lol They're just pretty dunks, I don't know how else to describe them. Lol He goes up effortlessly and they usually have a bit of finesse to them. I'll also add his aggression and physical strength. People know he's a great defensive player, but I don't think the amount of physical strength he displays gets highlighted enough. This strength becomes apparent when he has to defend players with very athletic body types like Kawhi, Lebron and Giannis (can y'all tell I really like Dre, lol). 

Steve-O: His basketball IQ. I just think he has great awareness out on the court and plays off his teammates very well. I really try to pay attention to what guys are doing when the ball is not in their hands(setting screens, etc). People talk a lot about his chemistry with Russ and it's great, but his chemistry with Dre is also on another level. In past games, I usually notice them communicating the most. They're both the defensive anchors for the team and if anything he should be praised for his defensive efforts just as much as Dre is.

PG13: That man got some handles though! Lol I feel like his ball handling skills don't get talked about very much. I know some fans have beeen saying for years that he's just an underrated player in general. I think he gets his props though, I've heard a lot of people  (including commentators) mention he's one of the best 2 way players in the league.

","What's the most overlooked skill or qualities by your favorite Thunder players? Any skills or qualities that you feel the players don't get recognized enough for or isn't talked about at all. 

Russ: His leadership role. It says a lot when a guy can come out on the court and control the entire tempo of a team. The team usually feeds off his energy. If he's having an exceptional night on the court, his teammates will usually elevate their game (very obvious in those GSW games this season). 

Dre: His dunks. Im a chick, so I'll never be able to dunk and I'm extremely jealous. Lol They're just pretty dunks, I don't know how else to describe them. Lol He goes up effortlessly and they usually have a bit of finesse to them. I'll also add his aggression and physical strength. People know he's a great defensive player, but I don't think the amount of physical strength he displays gets highlighted enough. This strength becomes apparent when he has to defend players with very athletic body types like Kawhi, Lebron and Giannis (can y'all tell I really like Dre, lol). 

Steve-O: His basketball IQ. I just think he has great awareness out on the court and plays off his teammates very well. I really try to pay attention to what guys are doing when the ball is not in their hands(setting screens, etc). People talk a lot about his chemistry with Russ and it's great, but his chemistry with Dre is also on another level. In past games, I usually notice them communicating the most. They're both the defensive anchors for the team and if anything he should be praised for his defensive efforts just as much as Dre is.

I’m glad that he didn’t just make a trade to make one. Evans is likely to get bought out so he should be the number 1 target. If they don’t get him Belinelli is also very likely to be bought out. He could add some good consistent outside shooting that they need and keep Huestis in the starting line up for athleticism and defense. And if all else fails pick up Tony Allen for the defense but he shouldn’t be number 1 priority. I still believe George will resign as I think it’s his best option if he wants to win now.

"Please guys hear me out before downvoting this as nonsense.

The Thunder are high off a blowout win against the Warriors and  replacing Ferg with Heustis in the starting lineup was a very large part of that.  Losing Roberson sucks but seeing that WB/PG/Heustis/Melo/Adams lineup and especially that WB/PG/Heustis/Grant/Adams lineup made me realize you guys have found your answer.  Let me explain.

Remember that thread I made a couple of months ago explaining how the Thunder's defense was built for the Warrior's offense?

Thunder lead the league in causing turnovers.  Warriors are top 5 in turnovers per game.

However, it was the cumulative collection of Russ/Roberson/PG/ and Adams that made the defense special.  PG had a defensive wing running mate with Roberson and Westbrook is a pest with quick hands and Adams is a mountain. 

Then Roberson got injured and the mistake that your coach made was replacing him with T-Ferg.  T-Ferg has unknown potential but his effort cannot be questioned.  Sadly like most rookies, his defense is terrible.  As a result, PG became overworked on the perimeter, Russ and Melo get exploited on defense, and Adams is also overworked.  The culmination of this was represented by the statistical fact that your team had the worst defensive rating in the league without Roberson.  Not starting the ""appropriate"" substitute for Roberson was the problem.

From what I have seen, Heustis should have been in the starting lineup from the beginning.  I believe another poster said Heustis was a Roberson lite in terms of defense and I agree.  Heustis played lock down D on Beal and now Klay Thompson and I don't think that's an anomaly.  He made guarding Klay Thompson off ball look easy.  

Now that PG has found a defensive running mate, the Thunder can now emulate the defense they were playing before and get close enough to that defense to go on that tear they were on before.

I think the WB/PG/Heustis/Melo/Adams lineup is the way to go for the rest of the season.  We are starting to see just how good (great actually) Heustis is defensively  and now is the time to build his confidence going into the playoffs. 

I am still concerned about the issues your team failed to address via trade, but, your team killed other teams despite these issues because of their elite defense as well WB, Melo, and PG figuring it out together.  

I really like the WB/PG/Heustis/Melo/Adams lineup and this lineup along with your other defenders will give you guys a chance for a deep playoff run without Roberson.  

TLDR; Losing Roberson fucked up your defense-->Starting Ferg was not the answer-->Starting Heustis is the answer because  the starting lineup of WB/PG/Heustis/Melo/Adams is close enough defensively to the WB/Roberson/PG/Melo/Adams for your team to dominate again.

"First off, I don't think it will happen (hence the title) but could OKC potentially pull it off?

Their current salaries (excluding Russ, Melo, PG + Adams) are:

Roberson - 10m

Abrines - 5.455m


Patterson - 5.4516m


Singler - 4.996



Ferguson - 2.11884m


Johnson - 1.378242m



In total, these contracts equal 29.399918m, which wouldn't be enough. According to http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q86, teams can take back 125% of the amount outgoing, which would equal 36.7498975, which would be enough to take on LBJ's 35,607,969m salary (http://www.spotrac.com/nba/cleveland-cavaliers/lebron-james-2257/). OKC could also add picks + cash to the deal. Singler is the only bad contract there but he's an expiring deal so it wouldn't be too difficult to take the last year of his deal on.

"Let me preface this by saying that I like Melo. I think in several ways he has made an honest attempt to fit in and I've seen him make several extra passes. And I think for this team to be as dangerous as possible in the playoffs, Melo has to be involved. He can't just be an afterthought. He was a big part of why we won eight straight games. 

However, it seems like the last few games he has went back to old habits. He's been calling for a lot more post ups and has taken some bad contested jumpers. It also feel like he is missing a lot of open threes. He is 43/126 over the last nine games. He is now shooting 41/35/77 splits on the heat. 

Last night, he missed all four shots he took before leaving the game, which included two straight bad postups against draymond fucking green. I really do think we need Melo to beat the warriors in a series, but he's gotta know that he has to play within the flow of the offense for him to be helpful.

Anybody seeing this lately or am I just being too hard on him?

I have watched nba only once playoffs started, got into NBA just a week before Christmas. I am getting used to the how the league works with free agency, trades etc (I am an avid football -soccer to most Americans and yeah in European competitions no such thing as salary cap, draft existing) also starting to get used to the competition however this will take me a long long time but that’s all good :)
Decided to go for Thunder because blue is my favourite colour and yeah Russ is perfect. 

Was looking at past players we had and seen harden played for us and so did KD (his probably easier to understand, chased a ring and personally I do not blame him) sorry if that last part angered anyone but winning the ring is do all for probably 99% of players instead of becoming the city’s legend. 

Why did Harden and KD leave IF the reason for KD was not due to success, was it simply salary?

Can someone also tell me how this free agency shit works, how come we have a chance of losing PG when we just signed him. From a soccer fan no club in the world and I mean no club would sign a player for a 1 season contract unless the player is 32+ years old. Contracts are generally 3-5 years long. Did PG only sign a 1 year deal or is this the free agency thing that I will slowly learn and understand and that a contract means nothing or something?

"Adams is better than DJ. Yes. Adams is younger than DJ. Adams and Russ chemistry is amazing. All the yes.

Here's the problem. If we want to get better, we don't have many assets. If a package that includes, say Adams and Ferg get you DJ and Lou, and we can still get another wing (Hood or Joe Johnson) and/or even a center in Dedmon, doesn't that kind of make this team deeper?

DJ can do about 70-85% of what Adams does. I don't like DJ cuz he can't pass and he doesn't have a back to the basket game, but is it 100% necessary in this offense? We need rebounding and someone to catch the lob.

You guys have been salivating over Lou Williams.

And here's the thing. DJ can either opt out or we can extend him (ideally for cheaper per year). Imagine if we can do that with he and Melo,pay less and have a team competitive against the top teams in the West when Robes returns. Imagine being able to put together a solid team that can still compete the remainder of this year so we can keep PG.

We loved Kanter and were excited about Dipo, but we traded them and in turn got really good guys and convinced Russ to extend. What if these help keep PG and get Melo to renegotiate his deal to stay and ring chase?

Idk. Maybe I'm just convincing myself.

"Bulls fan here, who lurks around here sometimes bc Russ is my favorite player

Not to be that guy but guys....some of you are taking things for granted

After every loss i notice so many of your fans just straight shitting on the team, players, and some even saying they’re done with this team

You guys have had nothing but success the entire time this franchise has been a live. Theres teams that never even make the playoffs and fans still ride with their team and support no matter what. Dont take this the wrong way, but you guys have been spoiled with a lot of success in the last 10 years and the minute things go bad, some of you are out there giving up. It makes some of you look very weak and shows that you really dont know how it feels to be reeaaally bad and a constant lotto team year in year out. No appreciation

Seen my Bulls go thru so much, and definitely a lot of shitty times so when they’re having some success im there enjoying every minute of it regardless if things go bad during that time.

Appreciate what you have now, because it can be gone real soon. Dont give up. Remember that going thru the bad times, adversity, ups and downs, is what makes the reallly good times even sweeter as a fan. Dont be a fair weather fan, its just not a good look. 

Again, dont take this the wrong way, just my 2 cent and what ive noticed during November and now during this bad stretch. 

Remember that some fans would love and wish to be in your shoes and have such success year in and year out, dont take things for granted. 

That being said, good luck with the rest of your season.

"I've watched around 70% of thunder games this season (cause of Melo).  I know Terrance has put out around 2 or 3 phenomenal games (which is what you ask for from a rookie) which show a TON of future potential.  That said, *he's a rookie* and he's playing like a very green rookie (a ton of non-factor games and a good/great game here and there).

&nbsp;

Thunder (and its fans) need to decide if this is a year to just ""go for it"" with George and Melo out there along with Russell and Adams or to keep Fergusen, even if he only has 2 alright games, 1 awesome game, and a ton of nonfactor or bad games in a month.  

&nbsp;

Oquinn would shore up that backup C position which, imo, has looked pretty weak and risky with Patterson manning it.  PPat is a PF, not a C imo.  Lee would give you slightly above average defense and can shoot the ball damn well.  I truly believe these two players would help the team A LOT more over having Ferg and a combination of Huestis/Abrines out there.  Both are defensive players and both can shoot it.  Oquinn is a MASTERFUL passer too.

"This is definitely reactionary, but also seems pretty logical. Starters and bench are both terrible right now and I feel like this move would benefit both the team and players from this role change.

Patterson is a better, more active defender and natural fit with the starters offensively and defensively than Melo. Patterson moves the ball well, sets good screens, and hustles(something we need with Dre out). He would get more looks from 3 playing alongside Westbrook, which is another positive of this.

Another key part of this move and probably the biggest is that Melo would help the bench immensely, as the bench sorely lacks scoring and another offensive threat other than Felton. Melo could have a more important offensive role(6th man), other than spotting up 90% of the time and having the occasional post-up.

"Hi everyone. Knick fan here checking in.

Obviously with things that have transpired over the last few days, a number of scenarios have come up for potential replacements for Andre Roberson's defense production. ""Avery Bradley"", ""Marcus Smart"", ""Justice Winslow"" etc. To tell you the truth, OKC simply doesn't have the right assets or cap flexibility to acquire any of those players, so I'm interested in hearing your feedback on the possibility of Lance Thomas reuniting with the Thunder. Thunder management obviously still has a ton of respect for Lance Thomas for his short time there. He's respected by all teammates for being a consummate pro where ever he goes, for providing veteran leadership on and off the court, and for his defensive smarts and tenacity every game. He's also one of Carmelo's closest friends.

Those of you who haven't paid much attention to Thomas' play on the court in the last couple of years, allow me fill you in a little bit. Over the last few seasons, he is still very much relied on anchoring the Knicks' defense on the perimeter: preventing drives, providing effort on closeouts, and bringing invaluable help defense. At **6'8""** and **235 lbs** with terrific strength and lateral quickness, Thomas gives solid size to the perimeter, and is perfectly capable of switching onto positions 1-4 (ideal when facing a club full of ball-dominant shooters in the playoffs such as the Warriors). While Thomas may not be the slasher that Roberson is, he does bring an attribute that Roberson lacked: long-distance shooting. Ever since joining the Knicks, Thomas has indeed molded his game into the prototypical 3&D player, increasing his 3 point shot percentage wise and volume wise, shooting at a respectable **.409 3P%** over the last 3.5 seasons. With a low usage rate, Lance can still fill the hole in OKC's perimeter defense without the team sacrificing touches for the Big 3.

**Here are some intriguing stats and footage for you to review and consider:**

Season | Opponent FG% Differential
---|---
2014-15 (OKC/NYK)|Opponents shoot **-1.3 FG%** from league average when guarded by Lance Thomas
2015-16 (NYK)|Opponents shoot **-3.3 FG%** from league average when guarded by Lance Thomas
2016-17 (NYK)|Opponents shoot **-5.1 FG%** from league average when guarded by Lance Thomas
2017-18 (NYK)|Opponents shoot **-9.6 FG%** from league average when guarded by Lance Thomas

**TLDR:** OKC can acquire a defensive stopper in Lance Thomas to play along side Westbrook, George, Adams, and Anthony, **without** giving up an arm and a leg. The Knicks might even throw in O'Quinn if the package can net them a younger prospect and a 2nd rounder.","Lance Thomas - Cheap replacement for Andre Roberson? Hi everyone.

"Why does losing Andre have such an effect on how the entire team plays? The answer is losing Andre has a massive effect on how Russ plays, which in turn has repercussions for the entire team. Without Andre, Russ's defensive weaknesses are exploited. Andre's help defense isn't there when Russ loses his man, leaving shooters wide open on the perimeter and Adams is quite often having to cover this leaving the rim open inside. Without Andre, Russ is having to expel more energy on defense which means he has less energy on offense, so we're seeing Russ make stupid plays on the attack. Yes we've had a tough travel schedule lately but it's becoming a pattern.

"Some Thunder fan over on r/nba insisted to me that Billy doesn't run any plays, which is not true. It's O.K. to not like Billy, but let's at least not like him for the right reasons. 

Anyhow, I have decided to show the wonderful users of r/Thunder the basic sets that Billy usually runs. To me, knowing the plays make the games more fun to watch, and it's interesting to see when Billy throws in a random set play that we haven't run yet. 

**NOTE:** This doesn't include High pick-and-rolls (which we run ALOT), inbounds plays, or isos, because who cares. 

**HORNS**

""Horns"" is a play that pretty much every NBA team runs. Westbrook is at the top of the key, usually Steve and PG (or Melo) will be on the elbows, and shooters (and Dre) will be in the corners. Russ will run a brush screen with Adams while Adams rim runs, and PG (or Melo) will slide up to the perimiter. 

https://streamable.com/aq5ya


**PG PINDOWN**

A very simple play. PG comes off a pindown screen set by Adams. George will read his defender to see if he trails or cheats. George can either shoot the jumper or attack the basket. 

https://streamable.com/5s4h4

If the defense cheats up, Steve will slip it for an easy lob.

https://streamable.com/qu7z0

**PG SWEEP**

Another play that gets George going. Comes across the court with a brush screen from one of our big men. The big man then re-screens George and runs a Pick-and-roll on the weak side.

https://streamable.com/0729f


**HAWK**

This one's my favorite, and probably our most versatile set. It gives multiple options for our guys, mostly Westbrook (the ballhandler), Melo, (strong side pick-and-roll), and George (comes off a weakside double pindown.) This is a reliable play to run down the stretch of a close game on multiple possessions. 

If the hedge defender cheats up, Melo is open

https://streamable.com/bm6kv

Of course Russ has free reign to use the initial pick-and-roll to his advantage:

https://streamable.com/ylq9l

If the initial pick-and-roll is played well, George is still coming off the double screen on the weak side:

https://streamable.com/gtfax

**SCREEN THE SCREENER**

This is one of Billy's go-to after timeout plays, and we mainly run it for Steve. Russ runs a pick-and-roll with Adams. While that happens, another player will set a backscreen on Adams' man, freeing up the lob. 

https://streamable.com/6przt

Those are just the basics. There are other ""pet"" plays and simple motions that Billy runs. The fun part is during the playoffs. These plays set the foundation for better execution come April. NBA offenses as a whole get more intricate, and these plays (especially Hawk) will get more complicated and more options will become available. 


edit: Credit to MLG highlights and Rapid Highlights on Youtube for the clips","Billy's 2017-2018 Playbook (so far) Some Thunder fan over on r/nba insisted to me that Billy doesn't run any plays, which is not true. It's O.K. to not like Billy, but let's at least not like him for the right reasons. 

Anyhow, I have decided to show the wonderful users of r/Thunder the basic sets that Billy usually runs. To me, knowing the plays make the games more fun to watch, and it's interesting to see when Billy throws in a random set play that we haven't run yet. 

**NOTE:** This doesn't include High pick-and-rolls (which we run ALOT), inbounds plays, or isos, because who cares. 

**HORNS**

""Horns"" is a play that pretty much every NBA team runs. Westbrook is at the top of the key, usually Steve and PG (or Melo) will be on the elbows, and shooters (and Dre) will be in the corners. Russ will run a brush screen with Adams while Adams rim runs, and PG (or Melo) will slide up to the perimiter.

**PG PINDOWN**

A very simple play. PG comes off a pindown screen set by Adams. George will read his defender to see if he trails or cheats. George can either shoot the jumper or attack the basket. 

https://streamable.com/5s4h4

If the defense cheats up, Steve will slip it for an easy lob.

**PG SWEEP**

Another play that gets George going. Comes across the court with a brush screen from one of our big men. The big man then re-screens George and runs a Pick-and-roll on the weak side.

https://streamable.com/0729f


**HAWK**

This one's my favorite, and probably our most versatile set. It gives multiple options for our guys, mostly Westbrook (the ballhandler), Melo, (strong side pick-and-roll), and George (comes off a weakside double pindown.) This is a reliable play to run down the stretch of a close game on multiple possessions. 

If the hedge defender cheats up, Melo is open

Of course Russ has free reign to use the initial pick-and-roll to his advantage:

If the initial pick-and-roll is played well, George is still coming off the double screen on the weak side:

**SCREEN THE SCREENER**

This is one of Billy's go-to after timeout plays, and we mainly run it for Steve. Russ runs a pick-and-roll with Adams. While that happens, another player will set a backscreen on Adams' man, freeing up the lob. 

https://streamable.com/6przt

Those are just the basics. There are other ""pet"" plays and simple motions that Billy runs. The fun part is during the playoffs. These plays set the foundation for better execution come April. NBA offenses as a whole get more intricate, and these plays (especially Hawk) will get more complicated and more options will become available.

"Man not thunder related but if the rumours are true that Lebron would meet with GSW, and he eventually signed, first of all his legacy would be ruined, secondly, if i was another team in the NBA I'd just refuse to play them. Not because I was afraid or anything like that, but they've just ruined the competitiveness in the NBA. I think that's the reason I despise the Warriors and KD so much, and if Lebron was to go there too well jeez, I couldn't see the point in following the NBA anymore, what a weak ass move :/","Lebron to GSW Man not thunder related but if the rumours are true that Lebron would meet with GSW, and he eventually signed, first of all his legacy would be ruined, secondly, if i was another team in the NBA I'd just refuse to play them.

"Nuggets - Away - L

Pelicans - Home - W

Lakers - Home - W

Warriors - Away - L (This is going to be extremely hard, the warriors are 19-6 at home plus they will be coming for revenge after our last spanking blowout we served to them, that could go very good for them or very bad)

Lakers - Away - W

Grizzlies - Home - W

Cavaliers - Home - W/L? They lost K.Love, it can go either way, it depends who they picked up before then and if they're starting to gel. But based on our last meeting i'm going to give us the slight advantage W. (Melo takes LeBron game very personal, which leads to good games for him)

Grizzlies - Away - W

Kings - Away - W 

Warriors - Away - W (Maybe we can pull an upset after losing early in the month to them?, this season shows that we show up in big games, plus by then we should have filled the SG role or C role, or even better both! Don't sleep on Presti, hes the deadline magician)

Magic - Home - W

Mavericks - Away - L (Because we wouldn't be the Thunder without losing to another sub .500 team after beating the warriors)

Prediction: 9-3 //// Record: 39-24 (I wouldn't be mad if we dropped another game than predicted, 8-4 is still a success and i'll still take that, but we could also be better than i predicted! 12-0 BOIS!)

"Right, so fresh of our blockbuster trade with the Pacers, maybe they'd be down to hand over one more asset in exchange for a brighter future?

A few points:

Lance and PG have a LOOOOOT of experience together.

Lance is a great player when he's not busy being too flashy. I think of Dion Waiters and the role he played for us two years ago. Talk shit about Dwait all you want but he was CRUCIAL for that team. 6th-ish man who can fucking hound a guy like Klay or Ariza... Gimme that dude.

If we're gonna trade a player, its gonna be Abrines. Abrines best friend in the NBA? Domas. Domas' team? Pacers. Honestly the Pacers could be a great place for a guy like Alex to blossom... Domas and Vic sure have.

It makes a lot of sense. What is everyone's thoughts? I haven't gone to the trade machine or anything but I also know they have Al Jefferson who could be a killer back up center when playing a team like the Spurs. We also have Jeremi as an asset and Vic is like his best friend, I'd rather try and keep him in FA tbh tho.

Also, Lance is on an AMAZING contract. I dont know if Pacers would want to give that up but honestly he has a great trade value right now if they're open to it. I'd rather have him than Tyreke. Tyreke aint got no Playoff experience","The player we need to finish this team is Lance Stephenson Right, so fresh of our blockbuster trade with the Pacers, maybe they'd be down to hand over one more asset in exchange for a brighter future?

"He played a really good game on the defensive end. He was keeping up with Beal around screens and providing good help defense as well. His mistakes at the end were costly but so were Russ's, Adams and Melos and they're veterans.

The more important thing tonight was that Huestis provided us with some of the defensive relief Roberson did and I think he needs to be in the starting lineup instead of Ferguson. Ferguson gets mismatched a lot because of his thin body and it forces everyone to work more to cover for him.","Despite his late game mistakes, Huestis was terrific defensively tonight.

"The Kid's got all the talent in the world and the 2 that this franchise has needed since Harden was traded. I believe Presti knows the kids potential and spent our only 1st rounder for years on him.

But we shouldnt want to trade him. It is difficult to find such a willing defender that is windmill dunking in game and can shoot the 3 as a rookie and is 6'7.

Yes he needs more muscle, and development, but he's also a rookie. 

He has star potential labeled all over him. It is not worth it. 

The downside to trading him is someone we could get like courtney lee could fall off as easily as next year, then Paul George is gone. Robes also may not fully recover so hell be a slower defender and has no offensive game to rely on. 

Melo could easily leave as well If LeBron tries to recruit him to a championship contender. 

We need someone who can be the future and we are definitely not finding better the Terrance Ferguson. We could easily have an all star level lineup 1-5 as early as next year if he develops quickly. 

The downsides to trading him for a barely above average player are too great. 

The pros are all short term and these players may not even be nearly as productive in our system when sharing the ball with the players we have now. 

Scoring 20 on the knicks is alot different than scoring 20 with us. 

Also whoever you trade for needs to be able to play offball well and I havent seen any discussion on that. 

Overall, T-Ferg's ceiling is way, way, too high to trade for courtney Lee who might, be good for us and might end up disappointing us and then losing our future. Meanwhile Ferg really isnt all that much worse than him at 19.

"I'm an OKC fan living in Detroit now, so a fan of both teams I'd say. Based on my own opinion and the opinions of others on the Pistons sub, getting Bradley shouldn't be too hard for OKC. 

From what we've seen so far, we've actually played better with Luke Kennard on the starting lineup both offensively and defensively. He's only 21 and already the best shooter on the team. No need to stop his development and force Bradley to keep playing. Plus since Kennard is a SG, we don't truly need Ferguson since they play the same position. 

Also Bradley can walk at the end of the season and is most likely going to leave us and look for $20mil+ so I don't think expecting a first rounder is realistic (unless Cleveland ends up wanting him for their own pick).

Abrines would be good for us as a backup SG and hopefully he gets his shot back and keeps improving. We are lacking at both SF and PF, so either Huestis or Grant would be nice young prospects there. Throw in a second rounder to sweeten the deal and I'd like it as a Pistons fan. 
 
What do yall think?

Send: Abrines + Huestis + 2nd rounder

Receive: Avery Bradley

Edit: as a Thunder fan and someone who's watched Bradley this season, here are some downsides. He seems to have lost his shot and keeps bricking long 2s while taking like 16 of them a game. He can't dribble whatsoever and has trouble making wide open layups on a fastbreak. His defense hasn't been consistently good like it was on the Celtics, maybe because he was injured for a few weeks. Him being injury prone is also a negative. Also I don't think OKC can afford to keep him after this season, so he'd be a rental. 

On the plus side, he won't have to shoot as much on OKC and can focus on playing great D the entire game. Plus, he's a good spot up 3 shooter. I don't know why he takes so many long 2s but hopefully he takes the wide open 3s he would get next to 3 superstars.

"This was something that was never brought up until a video was made about it by BBALLBREAKDOWN earlier in the season when we were having our struggles. Ever since then it seems like people are constantly bringing it up. Even now when Russ is playing arguably the best basketball of his career, Thunder fans are still claiming he needs to add it to his game, when in reality, it's bullshit. It's another fake narrative that people have made popular as an attempt to knock Russ's game, just like the ""Russ doesn't make his teammates better"" narrative.

&nbsp;

If Russ thought off-ball movement could elevate his game, don't you think he would do it? Or at least try it? Russ is a superstar, he has done and will do whatever he can in order to be the best player possible. Russell's game is based around attacking the rim, no other player burns as much energy as him, attacking the rim, non stop every single game. If he ran about like crazy off ball running through screens and so on he would be completely exhausted toward the end of the game.

&nbsp;

The reason players like Steph Curry run like crazy off-ball is because his whole game is based around running through screens and shooting threes, it's what he's good at. He also doesn't use most of his stamina attacking the rim most posessions. Let Russ do what he's good at instead of trying to change his game. The man just won an MVP, averaged a triple double and is now playing in my opinion better than he's ever played in his career over the course of the last month and a half.","Can we stop the whole ""Russ needs to move more off-ball"" narrative now?

"The journey home was long for our heroes, but riding the high of the skirmish they endured days prior kept them full of vigor.  After a few days travel, with little rest, they found themselves on the outskirts of home.  Smiling from ear to ear, they continued onward towards Castle Chesapeake. 

Walking through the suburbs of the Castle, lay a town built solely of bricks.  Upon seeing our heroes return, the people began shrieking and yelling towards them.  As our heroes proudly walked onward, they felt very uneasy. 

As they walked under a bridge crossing outside of their castle, they noticed a mob of villagers shouting.  Andre, Son of Rober puts his hand on the shoulder of a nearby drum playing popper and asks what the commotion is.

“Sir! Sir!” the pauper shouts. “A group of pirates from the east has come for you all!” 

St George, 13th of his name pushes through the crowd to better seat himself in front of the castle. After a quick glimpse, he immediately understands.  He pushes back to his group to relay the details.

“A group of pirates indeed.” St George proclaims.  “Have we met them before?.”

“Aye.” Squire Kiwi says.  “But you, St George, we're not with us at the time.  It was on our journey south, to the land beyond the wall of nonexistence. 

The group recalls together.  A band of pirates set up a surprise ambush in Mexico's Capital.  After a hard fought battle, the pirates left our heroes for dead.  However, before falling unconscious, Sir Brook of West recalls the last words murmured to him before blacking out. “Don't forget our name...we are-”

“The nets...” Sir Brook of West proclaims.  

“And they're not pirates, they're rogue fishermen.” Sir Melo the Hooded says.  “They are from a city among the outskirts of my old home.  A small coastal region surrounded by water.  They were once a group of hard working men; however, after years of being abusedby my home city, they had enough.  They became angered and proceeded to separate themselves from the New City of York, to become the “pirates” they claim to be today.”  

Squire Kiwi booms with laughter.  “The nets have no right to be here, let alone in our castle.  Who let them in anyway?”

The uneasy pauper tells the heroes of the raid. While squirming to free himself from under Andre's continuous grip, the pauper tells the story of how the nets raided the city while our heroes traveled to the land of Cleve.

Andre, Son of Rober chuckles. The pauper, finally free from his grip, begins to trot off.  “Pauper!” Andre shouts.  “Tell the nets we have arrived.”  He tosses the pauper a 'Thunder Cares' shirt as a form of payment, turns back to the group, and speaks.  

“We need to formulate a plan gents...  For back then, we were without St. George!  This time, we have the upper hand.”

“Those poor bastards.” Sir Brook of West whispers under his breath...


The day quickly turned to eve.  Our heroes had gathered a plan and were ready to take action.  Confidently, they reach the front gates of the castle.

Walking through the corridors of Castle Chesapeake, they find themselves once more, in the middle of a dimly lit arena.  Echos surround our heroes.  They quickly press themselves back to back. 

Suddenly, a single set of foot steps fill the air.  Our heroes proceed to look in all directions when a snake haired man steps forth. 

“Sir Melo the Hooded...”  A voice clamors. “I thought I left you for dead many moons ago.”

Sir Melo looks at the direction of the voice.  “Child!  Come forth and let me see who speaks!”

Out of the shadows, a 6'5 man approaches.  “Child!” He yells.  “I am grown! It is you who wept like the child when I left you to the buzzards!”

“Russel the Angel...”  Sir Melo says. “You have beaten me but once and that was merely by surprise!  I see you've delivered yourself to my home for swift kick in the pants!” 

Russel the Angel unsheathes his sword.  “I will do the kicking Sir Melo the Hooded...And after I'm done here, you will run away from these gents, just as you have in the past...Now take out your sword and fight me IRL.”

A fishing pole lowers down and rests upon Russel the Angel's sword.  Russel the Angel looks up to see St. George, 13th of his name with a wry grin on his face.

“What is the meaning of this?” Russel the Angel shouts.

“House rules, bitch.”  St. George says.  

Andre, Son of Rober explains. “To win, you must fish.  If you all are so good at your craft, this should be no issue. However, where you have a team of pretend pirates...we have an actual skilled fisherman in our small brigade.  The group with the highest weight in fish, will be chosen as the winner.”

“If you win,”  Andre explains, “you keep our fish, and your fish.  You claim our territory as your own.  We pay your fee's home and never step foot in your land again for probably a few months.  However, WHEN you LOSE, you leave our land, the fish you caught, your coin, and you have to go home and tell everyone that you lost which really really sucks...”

Angel thinks heavily...  “Aye...that sounds like a plan...”

7:15PM approaches quickly.  Our heroes emerge at the canal armed with fishing poles. They make their way to the bank and proceed to set bait on their hooks.  

The Eastern pirates show up with nothing more than their fishing nets.  Sir Melo objects stating they need to fish with poles.  Angel argues back “Whoops...you must have looked over the rule where you said we FISH.  You never told us HOW to fish.  We'll use our nets while you catch only one at a time.”

Our heroes cast into the river.  A single fish being caught with every net load the pirates seem to beach.  Over and over our heroes find themselves glancing towards the pirates as they haul in more fish.  With every net load they drag up, our men continue to get more and more flustered.  

Squire Kiwi approaches St George.  “This is ignorant!  We'll never win by fishing this way!”  

Sir Brook of West pipes in, frustrated.  “He's right! With nothing but the hooks on our poles, we won't catch as many fish as the Pirates.  We should cut holes in their nets.”

St George looks at them with calm eyes and says “There are two types of fisherman, Squire.  Those that fish for sport...and those that fish for fish. And sir Brook of West...I would prefer we lose with honor, than win by cheating.  There is a time to fish...and a time to dry the nets.”

“Well, St George, I think it's time to dry my nets then...”  Sir Brook of West and Squire Kiwi walk up the bank to sit. 

Suddenly, the water in the river begins to bubble.  Our heroes stare on as the bubbles get bigger and faster.  Soon the water begins to splash ferociously as a HUGE fish breaks the surface.  Thrashing rapidly back and forth, this fish is suspended in midair with what looks to be a human hand in its mouth.  The commotion grows as our heroes jump at the bank.  Curiosity and disdain quickly turns to celebration and disbelief as Raymond, the Thick emerges from the river holding a TWENTY-ONE pound catfish!  Excitedly, our heroes jump in the river to grab the two.

As they haul the two on shore, Sir Brook of West and Kiwi run down the bank excitedly, and with a new breath of life, picks up his rod, casts into the river, and yells to his Brothers to do the same.  Raymond, the Thickness continues to count the weight of the fish, while our heroes suddenly find their luck in catching and reeling in a copious amount. 

The last few minutes are upon them.  The nets continue to bring in large amounts of small fish while our heroes reel in between one and three pound fish.  Raymond, the Thick begins the countdown.  Within the last thirty seconds, as night has fallen, the fish have stopped biting.  The last our heroes checked, the were losing to the Nets by a few pounds. 

All of the sudden, with seven seconds left in the the tournament, Sir Brook of West's line began to tug.  “I've got one!” he yells through the banks.  “I've got a fish!” 

Russel of Angel yells through the evening air that it will not count unless he can land it. 

Sir Brook of West, exhausted through the evenings endeavors, begins to reel as quickly as he can.  However, the fish, with the strength of twenty, fights back.  Sir Brook pulls as hard as he can as the time counts down....

Raymond the Thick continues to count.  The clock has reached it's final second.  With one finishing sweep, Sir Brook of West lets out a warriors scream so loud that the lightening seemed to summon through his throat.  He whipped the fishing rod back so fast that thunder shrieked through the air.  The fish flies out of the water, through the cool evening sky, and makes a splash at St George's feet.

“...Time...” Raymond of Thick says.

Our men shout and jump with joy as the final weight of the fish reaches One hundred and Nine, to the Pirates One hundred and eight. 

The Nets held up their end of their bargain.  They left Castle Chesapeake with nothing left but the shirts on their back, heads hung low.  As our men gather the rest of the fish, St George reaches out to Sir Brook of West. 

“Patience, my friend, is how you catch the biggest fish...”

* Knicks get: Alex Abrines, Kyle Singler, Terrance Ferguson

Lee is having a career year with 13.6 points per game and leading the league in free throw percentage.  Nice catch and shoot piece off the bench, and we would get much younger at the shooting guard position.

"With the Spurs losing to the Pacers today they drop to 30 - 18 and tie with the Timberwolves for the 3rd seed. 

We are now only 3 games behind them at 26 - 20 with another 36 games left to be played.

With the Timberwolves having had a favourable schedule to begin the season and the Spurs having recently lost Kawhi 'indefinitely' again we may actually have a real shot at catching that 3rd seed before the end of the season.

This would be huge as it would allow us to play a much weaker team in the first round with home court advantage (Blazers, Pelicans, Nuggets or Clippers instead of Timberwolves or Spurs without home court) along with avoiding Golden State in the second round.

Hopefully Presti can work some magic at the trade deadline to bolster our bench and the guys continue to become more consistent as closing this 3 game differential over the season may have a massive impact on our franchise.","We are now only 3 games behind the 3rd seed.

"They had just defeated a squad of yellow shirts.  Lonzo of Laker, under his injured breath, has whispered to Sir Brook of West, he was sent to destroy them under the republic of California.  

The republic of California was home to a devastating group of individuals.  Their names traveled across the land with a tremble of fear when spoke: ""The Warriors.""  With members like Stephen of Curry, Sir Klay, The Snek, and few more, there is reason to be afraid.  Ruling the Republic, they had succumbed to defeat very few times.  Once being to our heroes.

""The Warriors sent you?"" Sir Brook of West asked Lonzo of Laker. 

""Indeed.  But if revenge is what you seek, you must travel East.  Find King James and take him out first.  Only then will the Warriors know you've survived and you're coming for blood.""

King James.  He was a generous King.  His people adored him and have for years.  The rumors as of late have stated he is on a quest of his own.  He was blood thirsty with intent on receiving his 30,000th kill.  If he were to reach this, he would be considered an Elite King. 

This did not bode well with Sir Brook of West.  He rallied his troops and began to travel. 

**********

Sir Brook of West, traveled with few and trusted even less.  His right hand man,  Big Kiwi, always had his back.  Sir Robes was rumored to have some of the quickest hands in the West.  Melo of Knicks, came to them recently with open arms, aiding to join them in their journey. With knowledge of King James, he is definitely an asset.  Lastly, PG of 13.  Nobody really knows where PG is from.  With a slick hairline, and arms the length of the Nile, he must be Alien, however, he claims he too is from the East. 

**********

After days of travel, our heroes breached the hillside.  Once atop the mound, they paused to look over the kingdom.  In the distance they could hear chatter of townspeople.  The clatter of transport over the cobbled stone.  They probably heard cows too.  With shouts of praise directed at King James, they knew this was the kingdom.  The land of Cleve.  Home of King James and his squad of Elite Knights.  

As Sir Brooke of West and his men entered town, they heard commotion.  It sounded as though a celebration was about to take place.  As our travelers continued through town, they were greeted with looks of daggers, hisses and boos, they were being shouted at and spit on.  Big Kiwi, the tallest of the group, looked forward and noticed the Arena, King James' Home, was lit with torch light.  

Picking up pace, the reached the doors.  Guards quickly pushed them in, onwards and upwards to the presence of King James. 

""I have been expecting you"" King James said.  ""I've heard rumors you have come for my head!""

laughter erupts through the arena.

""As you know, I'm few lives short of 30,000...and Lucky for me, my prey has landed in front of me, ready to be taken.""

Our heroes look around.  With hearts racing, adrenaline coursing through their veins, they quickly arm themselves for a battle. 

King James and his men stand up.  They reveal their swords, and charge our heroes...

********** 

Big Kiwi pressed his back against Sir Brook of West preparing for the worst.  Melo of Knicks and PG of13 stood within arms length, while Robes, sword at the ready, walked the perimeter of his squire, fending off anyone that came close.  

With swiping blows, quick jabs, and daggers placed with perfect timing, our heroes were making an impact.  However, King James continued to come back for more. Trade offs between King James and his men kept them fresh and ripe with stamina, but our men refused to back down.  

For every wound Sir Brooke of West received, he delivered 2 more. Melo of Knicks, never let his guard down.  Quietly keeping his stance, when someone drew near, he would swing, and almost never miss.  PG of 13 was a sniper.  With his pole-arm drawn, nobody could come within striking distance of him.  If, somehow, one of King James' men were close enough to do damage to Sir Brook of West, Big kiwi, would reach out with his bear sized hands, and deliver a crushing blow.

A battle that seemed to last for hours...2.5 hours to be exact, finally came to an end.  Our heroes, although damaged, were not phased.  King James and his men, however, lied in agony.  Sir Brook of West slowly limps towards King James who is on his back, gripping his side.  With his  sword drawn, Sir Brook of West looks down at King James. 

Standing over him, Sir Brook of West speaks.  ""You have taken many lives.  You were few away from becoming elite.  You have Killed many of my men, and taken lives of people I was close to.  However, this day, the day we were expected to be you last kill, will forever go down as the day King James has Fallen.""

""You may behead me... as I deserve it.  But know that my Kingdom will never fall"" James Says to him. ""We will be back...and in greater numbers...to take back the pride you have stolen.""

Sir Brook of West looks him in the eyes.  ""I am not taking your head.  I want you to live in the shame you have bestowed upon yourself.  Take your squad elsewhere, for even though we are enemies, I need you alive.  You and your Knights are my stepping stone to defeat the Warriors.  Go now!  Travel to Pop of Vic and do your dirty work there!""

Sir Brook of West drops his sword at King James' side.  The King lay injured, drowning in his tears yet relieved to see another day.  

Sir Brook of West gathers his men and they begin their journey home, unaware that Melo of Knicks neighboring enemy will lay there, waiting for their arrival.

laughter erupts through the arena.

""As you know, I'm few lives short of 30,000...and Lucky for me, my prey has landed in front of me, ready to be taken.""

Our heroes look around.  With hearts racing, adrenaline coursing through their veins, they quickly arm themselves for a battle. 

King James and his men stand up.  They reveal their swords, and charge our heroes...

********** 

Big Kiwi pressed his back against Sir Brook of West preparing for the worst.  Melo of Knicks and PG of13 stood within arms length, while Robes, sword at the ready, walked the perimeter of his squire, fending off anyone that came close.  

With swiping blows, quick jabs, and daggers placed with perfect timing, our heroes were making an impact.  However, King James continued to come back for more. Trade offs between King James and his men kept them fresh and ripe with stamina, but our men refused to back down.  

For every wound Sir Brooke of West received, he delivered 2 more. Melo of Knicks, never let his guard down.  Quietly keeping his stance, when someone drew near, he would swing, and almost never miss.  PG of 13 was a sniper.  With his pole-arm drawn, nobody could come within striking distance of him.  If, somehow, one of King James' men were close enough to do damage to Sir Brook of West, Big kiwi, would reach out with his bear sized hands, and deliver a crushing blow.

A battle that seemed to last for hours...2.5 hours to be exact, finally came to an end.  Our heroes, although damaged, were not phased.  King James and his men, however, lied in agony.  Sir Brook of West slowly limps towards King James who is on his back, gripping his side.  With his  sword drawn, Sir Brook of West looks down at King James. 

Standing over him, Sir Brook of West speaks.  ""You have taken many lives.  You were few away from becoming elite.  You have Killed many of my men, and taken lives of people I was close to.  However, this day, the day we were expected to be you last kill, will forever go down as the day King James has Fallen.""

""You may behead me... as I deserve it.  But know that my Kingdom will never fall"" James Says to him. ""We will be back...and in greater numbers...to take back the pride you have stolen.""

Sir Brook of West looks him in the eyes.  ""I am not taking your head.  I want you to live in the shame you have bestowed upon yourself.  Take your squad elsewhere, for even though we are enemies, I need you alive.  You and your Knights are my stepping stone to defeat the Warriors.  Go now!  Travel to Pop of Vic and do your dirty work there!""

Sir Brook of West drops his sword at King James' side.  The King lay injured, drowning in his tears yet relieved to see another day.  

Sir Brook of West gathers his men and they begin their journey home, unaware that Melo of Knicks neighboring enemy will lay there, waiting for their arrival.

"This is starting to be the new thing, so at the very least, I wanted to offer a different perspective with some fundamental and technical analysis. (Im using bballref for all stats).

**The Roles**

I've mentioned this time and time again. Last year, Carmelo was the #1 option on a team and scored 22.4ppg on 43%. He did this while spending 61% of his time as the SF. He played some stretch 4 in NY, but never spent more than 78% at that position in one season.

This year, we're asking him to change his role. We're not just asking him to be catch and shoot Melo, but he's spending 89% of his time at the 4 spot -- that's the most in his career. Where's he spending the rest of his time? **As a center.** Yes. Melo is playing 11% of his time as a center. ***He has played literally no minutes as a SF.***

We are trying to teach an old dog new tricks right now and it's very hard to come out of those habits when you aren't strict in this process. Melo with the 2nd unit makes him Iso Melo that freezes out his teammates. It also requires you to make a decision with positions...if you keep Melo as the 4 or 5 in the 2nd unit, then where do you play Jerami and Patterson? If you play Melo at the 3, then you're back to messing up teaching an old dog new tricks. And then why play Melo as the 3 when you've got a younger, more athletic and defensive minded 3 in Paul George? This helps continuity. (and really this should be the end of the argument, but we'll keep going).


**Lineup data is inconclusive at best**

There are 2 reasons why I think the data is inconclusive. The first is there are not enough stats for a 5-man lineup where Melo is the only starter. We tend to play him with at least one starter, typically a defensive minded one like Robes or someone who sets him up like Russ, both of which make all their teammates better. It's literally not fair to compare. We can see it with our eyes -- Roberson makes defenses better. Russ makes offenses better for catch and shoot guys. Duh.

One of the top 20 lineups with just Melo and bench has only played 36 minutes total. Melo/Abrines/Ray/Grant/Pat are a +5.5 total. This is a lineup, that in total, has played about .81 minutes a game, or 49 seconds a game. That's the equivalent. They have outscored the opponents then, by .125 ppg. 

The top 3 5-man lineups used are some variation of the starters (wherein it's Robes or Abrines or Ferg). The 4th played lineup is PG with the bench (with Abrines). This unit is a -38.2 total in 85 minutes. Switch Abrines out with Huestis and they're a -26.9 in 51 minutes. I'll agree with you that this isn't working...we don't need a break down of why (but my guess is the bench slows things down and turns into iso-pg and it messes up everything).

**What we need to be doing instead: Playing the all bench lineup.** 

The eye test shows me this is the best bench line up we've got. They have no other choice but to share the ball and they do.

If our best Melo + bench lineup is a +5.5 in 36 minutes and we think that's great, then the all bench unit is +5 in 46 total minutes. (sub in T Ferg for Abrines, they're +21.5 in 30 minutes).

This is a bench that brings energy when our starters are just going thru the motions. Every time you guys complain about the bench, it's the bench lineup with PG. And again, I'll agree that PG shouldn't play, but that the bench unit should play all together. They've spent a total of 76 minutes on the floor and have a better net rating than the team with Melo on the floor. They are a decent group.

Now, I'd play it by match-up. I do think when we play better benches (i.e., Cavs/Warriors/HOU bench with starter quality guys playing), we should play one of the big 3, and that 1 should be Russ.

"1st half was pretty much the old Billy Donovan lineups. Alot of things did not work well. 

Fortunately, Billy Donovan was willing to make adjustments this game.

1) He kept Melo in to play with the bench. George was subbed out, and Melo played the whole 3rd quarter. Sure he got hot, but it was noticeable how great the bench played with Melo.

2) When Melo checked out, the all bench lineup was played again. I don't think the all bench + George is any better, so I admit that this was a good adjustment. Let everyone rest.

3) Patrick Patterson has a nice  3 point shot, he just needs to get consistent open looks. Felton just wasn't able to execute that well tonight. And it was awesome that Billy went with Russ + bench. It's easy for Russ to execute the bench offense since everyone is pretty much a 3 point shooter.

I expect to see this going forward. Some combo of Melo and Russ + bench.

4) Huestis finished the game for OKC instead of Ferguson. 
I noticed George and Melo need help guarding the paint. George shies from contact in the paint, and he doesn't really block shots. Huestis is a great fit for certain matchups to just play aggressive defense and take hits in the paint and try to contend shots.

"Just a ""thinking"" post I guess, because I know it's impossible to keep all 3 here for the majority of their careers. These guys are the few left since I started becoming invested in OKC ( I think Collison is retiring after this season so I didn't include him). 

It has been amazing to see how much these guys have grown, especially Dre and Steve. They were drafted here out of college and for the organization to let one go will feel like a parent abandoning their kids. LoL It has been a joy to see all 3 out there together and their bond seemed to only get stronger with KD leaving. I don't feel like off court chemistry translates on the court 100% of the time with every player, but it clearly has with them.

"Upside reasons for melo to bench:
1. Allows more natural staggering of Russ and Melo - the two scorers, particularly isolation scorers, on the team
2. Manages an older player's (Melo) mins in blowouts and a less conditioned player (also Melo) gets run when other players are fatigued
3. Sets cultural tone that winning matters more than anything

Fake Downside reasons
1. Fewer mins for Melo (who is obv still our 4th or 5th best player): This will only happen in blowout games where we wouldn't need him
2. Melo will get pissed off and check out: And then waive his NTC! The whole point of the Melo trade was to raise our ceiling and lower our floor.

"Look at this video of Adams describing how the Thunder defends the PnR: https://streamable.com/a9pno

We literally scheme to allow bigs a lane to the hoop. What the fuck is this shit? This right here is why we give up points to bigs and a big reason why we give up open 3s. 


Because our scheme is to: 

1. Allow them to do what they want in the PnR, get the big man the ball on his way to the paint. At best we have a help defender to stop him (if the defender reacts in time, which they usually don't)

2. Leave a man open in the corner so Roberson or Melo can attempt to cover the paint for the rolling big man.

3. Take our best rebounder out of the paint. 


This has been part of our defensive scheme since Donovan got here, and we've been terrible at defending the PnR that entire time. Why is Donovan so set on this? It's terrible. It gives the other team options to do whatever the fuck they want on offense. We only get by because of Roberson's incredible defense. This is why we suck so much without him, because our defensive scheme only KIND OF works with him.

Fuck I'm tired of seeing this. ","Our PnR defense needs an immediate change. Look at this video of Adams describing how the Thunder defends the PnR: https://streamable.com/a9pno

"I feel like this seasons is an extremely important one for Russ' legacy . This year is probably the Thunder's best chance at a title if they cant secure Melo/George. Would you all agree? 

Side Note:
Am I the only one who thinks Russ get Lebron like unfair criticism? This is not to say he does not have his weaknesses, but it seems to me like most critiques of Russ are false narratives that have been dragged on from his rookie year. It's like the media chooses to ignore how much his game has changed/improved just in the month of December/January cause it doesn't match their narratives. I get its a somewhat small sample size as well but he can probably play this way for the rest of the season and shoot over 46% by the time the regular season is over.","Russell Westbrook's Legacy I feel like this seasons is an extremely important one for Russ' legacy .

"It's pretty simple, they don't play hard enough against mediocre teams. 

It's not that they aren't capable of getting 3rd seed, I actually think they can beat every team in the league if they got time to gel, and if they played like their life depended on it. But it seems like they don't really give that much of an effort unless it's a top team or a division threat (even then it's sometimes... ""meh""..)

This season OKC has beaten teams like GSW, Rockets, Spurs (although that was a cheap one, but the other one would have been different if the toe wasn't on the line), but at the same time they've lost to Suns, Knicks, Nets, Kings and twice to Mavs. It shouldn't be like that when this team is capable of blowing out those teams, but in the end it all boils down to effort. It's arrogance, and the nonchalant attitude isn't helping. 

Tyson Chandler wanted those offensive boards MUCH more than Adams (or anyone else), and in the first half alone Suns had 20 (!!) out of its 23 second chance points in the first half. That alone is not acceptable. That combined with 57% from FT on a decent volume (21 attempts)? 

I can guarantee you Westbrook doesn't miss FT's like that in a clutch match like GSW, as a matter of fact last game against them he shot 88%. The Rockets game you say? He shot 88% in that game as well. 

Watching how Timberwolves play they want it much more, and they play hard against anyone, both good and bad teams. For that reason alone they are gonna win more games, and because we just show up like ""*meh, Suns whatever issa walkover*"", we're gonna lose more games even though we're capable beating a team like Timberwolves easily.

"""Hawk"" is a set that Billy Donovan has been running more and more each game. Here it is in its entirety (With Roberson being the recipient on this particular possession): 

https://streamable.com/ugiqt

This play puts the ball in Westbrook's hands, gives him options, and lets him make the right decision. Whether it's Russell attacking off the pick and roll (which very few teams in the league can stop):

https://streamable.com/tmt9u

OR hitting George for the 3 off the double screen (where he's shooting a career high 44%):

https://streamable.com/gz5r7

https://streamable.com/mdcf5

OR hitting Melo for a spot-up mid range jumper

https://streamable.com/jv9jf

This play caters to OKC's stars strenghts. Westbrook in the pick and roll, Melo spotting up for midrange after the pick, and George coming off a catch-and-shoot.

Here's Westbrook utilizing the initial PnR to shoot his signature shot, a pull-up J on a dime from 15 feet:

https://streamable.com/5knaq

If the defender overplays on the hedge, Russ still has a lane to do Russ things:

https://streamable.com/ui4ur

This play is also tailor-made for a guy like Paul George, an excellent catch and shoot player who loves to come off of screens and either shoot or attack. If the play is defended well and no options seem open at first, OKC uses Adams as a screener in late shot clock situations so George can get a clean look:

https://streamable.com/9hb2a

If defenders hug up on PG and anticipate the screen, Paul can improvise:

https://streamable.com/030wu

Obviously, OKC still has a lot to figure out. But Billy Donovan seems to be playing to the strengths of the stars and it makes basketball easier for them.

"I was not surprised, due to his athleticism (which I think is STILL underrated despite what we’ve seen), but Josh Huestis finished with 9 rebounds. 

He got some in the third and fourth quarters, but somebody has to play. I think if he and Terrance Ferguson can continue to show more promise in these games without Roberson, it’s time to try and package Abrines and either Grant/Patterson for the missing piece/s we need to go over the top. 

Huestis has displayed, not only equivalent athleticism as Jeremi Grant, but a much higher BBall IQ. Jeremi Grant goes blank, or is out there over thinking things too often. Josh has a better mid range shot, and a better long ball.  Most importantly HE DOESN’T PLAY SOFT. 

Jeremi could be one of the best 3-D players of this era of basketball but he doesn’t seem to understand the realm his physical ability has placed him in.  He could be THE X FACTOR on this team, but doesn’t want to be. You can’t teach that mentality. But I digress...

I think Huestis is honestly making the better case to be retained over Grant so far. Thoughts?

I was a huge supporter for Patterson but I feel he's really lost a few steps. maybe it's a prolonging injury but right now he's gotta get right man.


I feel like we either need to sign the best center we can or keep Dakari as our center. 2pat just doesn't work at the 5.


would rather use money to keep Grant and huestis together rather than keep 2pat which was crazy to say months ago.

"Good afternoon r/Thunder,

Its been a hectic week of dramatic Redditing but its finally over. Foobzy stepped down on his own accord. Regardless of how he acted or how people may feel about him, we would still like to thank him for his time he put into the sub and wish him well. Though we now have a new head mod, u/Lolsokje, we assure you that this sub will never be governed by a single moderator ever again. All major changes and decisions will be left to a majority group vote as already decided by Lolsokje and the rest of the mod team.

We always encourage you guys to speak up, privately or publicly when you feel there is anything we can improve on with this sub. Hopefully we can get back to focusing on basketball in this sub. I'd like to remind everyone that though we allow almost all civil conversation that doesn't break sub rules to occur unmoderated in META threads, this sub is not for racial and or political debates. It doesn't matter to us what you look like or who you vote for as long as you Thunder the fuck up!

In the interest of full disclosure, I will be deleting all the META posts on this subject as the issue is now resolved and those threads were largely political and aggressive as well as cluttering up the past week on the front page.

We would also like to welcome u/Dixbfloppin93 to the mod team. You may recognize him as the guy who posts the pre and post game threads. I feel he will make an excellent addition to the mod team. 

Once again we appreciate your patience while we sorted all this out. If anyone has anymore questions on the subject, feel free to comment in this thread or message us directly. 

Thunder the fuck up!

"My bf and I got into a debate about who will be the more respected player years down the line. I obviously said Russ and he said KD. His argument was that Russ has to win a chamionship or ""all those triple doubles don't mean shit"". Lol 

He feels like a ring and championship is what every player strives for and it's the ultimate level of success in basketball. I agree with this, but I don't think KD will be as respected given how he left and the team he chose to go to. My bf feels like I'm being bias and he said it doesn't matter how KD got his ring, the point is he got it (he referenced Allen Iverson and how he's viewed today because of his inability to get a ring). I would feel this way even if Russ wasn't my favorite player. KD will obviously go down as one of the best players so I don't want to discredit everything he has done. However, people say Russ' ""triple doubles don't mean shit"" and I feel like KD's championship don't mean shit. He went to a team that would have made the finals regardless and likely won without him.

How do y'all feel about this? Even if you guys weren't OKC fans, would you still feel like Russ would be more respected years down the line even if he doesn't get a ring?

"As a lifetime knick fan, who’s suffered through many terrible coaches; I find Coach Donovan incredibly intelligent. I’m in it this year with Carmelo Anthony, who’s been the best player on the Knicks for seven years. Phil Jackson ruined his chance at a ring in New York. But now this OK3 got together and I see them ultimately winning a championship. 

I went to the game when Me7o came back and watching both teams play was incredible. 

Back to Donovan. This guy knows what he’s talking about. He’s not like other coaches I’ve experienced with NYK. Fisher, Rambis and Horneack who say the same thing. “Players have to play in the system,” or “there wasn’t enough effort.”

Billy actually pinpoints micro problems in the game. He’s targeted Melo spotting up. Problems in the third quarter. Sharing the ball because he wants the other team to scramble so we get open shots. He’s clearly a former college coach because he is so keen on fundamentals. However so far I would say he has mastered the NBA level. 

He knew he needed to get this team to be efficient on defense and offense. He targeted defense first, perhaps realizing these players would be able to click quicker on the offensive end given their talents. Now this has become the most entertaining team to watch in the NBA. Steals and fast breaks. Lobs. A Kiwi. 

Cheers to Billy Donovan.

"1) I now own 2 Russell shirts and a jersey and don’t have to worry about them going out of style

2) EVERY SINGLE LOSS would be accompanied by a million threads about how Russ and George are going to the Lakers. ESPN would have so much content about it’d be ridiculous.

You have no idea how annoying it was to hear, from the OKC haters, that PG is literally here just to convince him to go to the Lakers with him. That rumor was put to rest before the season even started thank god. 

3) No distractions. Every game would be about feee agency and people would speculate every time we loss and hell, everytime we won too to talk about how he was staying or leaving.

4)He’s here for better or worse. He trusts Sam to the point where he’s spending the rest of his prime with us. And we will love every minute of it.

5) Also doesn’t hurt that the guy PG was so excited to play with is already locked in, and it should help in the free agency decision. 

Happy Russell Westbrook day!

"Westbrook is a known commodity. We all know how he plays and acts. Melo is a known commodity. A great scorer but not usually willing to be second fiddle. Paul George is a bit more unknown just due to not knowing what he needs to be in this offense. Purely shooter or a aggressive scorer. 

So all these pieces are on the table and it seems pretty clear that they are not going to change. Billy Donovan has to step in and create the chemistry the team needs. Just some order of an offense.

Whatever he laid out in the off-season is not fulfilling the need. Adjustment is key. But moreso, be the authoritative head coach and give an order.

Russ drives and hits PG. Shoot it or create a move, not there? Melo post, look for Adams. Russ cuts and gets the ball back. Drives and feeds to someone or finishes. This is a elementary offense that I'm not saying the Thunder should use. But there has to be some element of hierarchy with the ball.

I don't expect the Thunder to compete with GS this early, but I did expect them to be much better than they do now. ","No hate. Really think Donovan has to bring the team together.

"I get that he's your guy and you tend to love him especially after how Durant left but I have to ask: are you at all worried where you're headed with Russ as your best player? Do you think it's possible to build a championship caliber team around him? I mean he is in his prime now and doesn't seem like his prime necessarily means making others around him better like a traditional point guard would but it's something different. And how do you feel about the fact that his game is based on his amazing explosiveness and anger? I know the anger won't fade away but the explosiveness goes away at some point.

I'm not here to trash him, I like watching him play. But I would like to know how you guys honestly feel: Do you think you can win it all with Russ as your main guy?

I started thinking about this after the post on Dre. He's an elite defender, but his offense isn't where it could be.

On the bench, he just turns into iso-melo. Guys like Abrines/Huestis will probably see the ball even less. Is there anyone who thinks Melo goes to the 2nd unit to become Olympic Melo?

I'm not going to lie, a starting unit with Russ/Robes/PG/2Pat/Adams has me licking my chops in terms of defense and ball movement. I just think moving Melo to the bench easily turns our bench into poop.

"When Roberson is on the floor, the rest of the team is having to play with half of the court. On offense, f he’s on the left wing, the left side of the court is useless.  THIS IS WHEN THE OFFENSE BECOME THE MOST STAGNANT!! Melo, PG13 and Russ aren’t passing to him wide open when they know a contested shot from one of them is more probable of going in, and I don’t blame them!! He airballed a wide open three last night (see link below, look at how crowded the other guys are) - no shooting guard who makes it to the NBA should ever airball a wide open three, especially as often as he does! It’s ridiculous. Melo will willingly give the extra pass if abrines is there. Did it the other night and it looked great. 

Last night he had a fast break coming off a steal, but was to scared to attack the basket and draw the foul (against a JJ Reddick, if I recall correctly) because he didn’t want to go to the foul line and air ball free throws! Then, to make matters worse, the rest of the guys get double/triple teamed. OR, his defender is allowed to roam free and clog passing lanes. He isn’t a shooting guard - he’s a security guard. Other teams are EASILY able to hide their worst defender because we are playing the worst offensive player in the entire NBA. 

Roberson should be a situational starter only, against teams like Houston, GSW, etc. If there’s not a scoring threat for Roberson to guard, its ludicrous having him start. 

I want to see Heustis get more burn! He’s a more than capable defender. He was doing a great job when he was covering Ben Simmons the other night. Also, he does what Roberson doesn’t, HE HITS HIS SHOTS. He’s been knocking down all his open looks this season. Idk if presti is trying to keep his value down so they can resign him for the long term for cheap, bc he said he wants to stay here and they declined his player option. 

Either put Patterson in at the 4 and slide Melo to the 3, or swap Roberson with Heustis/Grant/Abrines and quit letting him collect dust on the bench.

Roberson is a great defender, but so are PG13, Heustis and Grant. The amount of points that Roberson keeps the other team from scoring is heavily outweighed by the points that he continues to cost the offense. It results in poor ball movement and difficult shots/crowded lanes. 

In conclusion, he does a great job on players like Harden and Klay. But if he’s guarding an average scorer, put somebody out there. Those are nights when we need scoring more than defense, because we have other capable defenders on the floor. Last season, he was the one we counted on to guard the wing defenders. This year, Paul George is more than capable of tackling that task. 

Quit blaming Russ, Melo and PG13 for the offensive issues when it’s clear the guy shooting 21% from 3-point land (WHILE TAKING WIDE OPEN SHOTS) and 38% FT shooting (WHICH ARE STILL WIDE OPEN SHOTS) is the reason for the problems in the offense. 

Until Billy benches his ass, this team will struggle with fluid ball movement.  Hard to move the ball and great open looks when the other team is playing with an extra player. GET HIM OFF THE FLOOR. 

I have no problem with Billy tinkering with the rotations, because that’ll pay dividends come playoff time. Scotty Brooks used to never adjust his lineups, we were too predictable and it was a problem.

Also, I am a huge Thunder fan living in OAKLAND CA. I wear their colors and apparel to the bar on game days while being surrounded by annoying blue and gold bandwagoners flaunting number 35... And their ridiculous ""The Town"" jerseys.

I endure this awkward self-induced-ridicule with a sense of pride because I know there are other Thunder fans out there around the world who care just as much as I do about their success. 

In fact, I initially became a fan of OKC because of KD! I swore to become a fan of whichever team he was on simply because of how much I respected his game and approach to life.

All that changed last summer when KD left to join the rival team we worked so hard to beat in the previous playoffs. I respect his decision to chase a ring, that just isn't the KD I grew to love. In fact, my passion has since shifted to the Thunder team as a whole!

I stayed loyal as a fan to the Thunder and their brand of basketball even though I have never stepped foot in Oklahoma City. 

Through all this team pride, I was excited to start reading and posting on this Sub when I found it.... Buuuut it turns out that I can't even make some playful jokes on here about the team's performance without getting down-voted to oblivion. 

All I really want to say is this: Calm The F*** Down. We all care about the team, and everyone needs to learn to take a little joke. Let's allow people on here to voice their opinions, even if it is critical of the team. ","Let's talk for a minute about how this Sub is WAY to serious... (Coming from a Fan's perspective)

"tl;dr  BD is a damn hustler

I've tuned in to every game this season with the exception of the first three.  Every game has been different.  Some nights, PG is on fire.  Tonight, Melo was on fire.  Every night, our defense is fucking awesome.  Some nights we win, some nights we lose, but it never fails that we blow a lead in third quarter whether we come out to win it or lose it afterwards. 

Except for one game.  The one game where BD told the guys ""go out there and give it all you've got."" and they did.  They put the warriors in their place and made it look easy.  

Because it is. 

Billy Donovan can't let other teams in on how well we can actually play. Otherwise they would study us.  If we played to our fullest potential every game, ran the same plays, shot the same shots, then we would never keep the other teams guessing about how we will play in the upcoming game.  BD comes in with his ""I'm new here"" attitude until it really matters;  The Playoffs...

So what is he doing?  He's telling the big three, Westbrook, Melo and PG, AND ONLY the big three, to fuck it up.  When we're ahead, he tells them to pull back and iso.  When we're behind, he tells them to close the gap and all of the sudden, they pass the ball and heat up again.  When it's close, he tells them to either stay behind and miss shots that the big three are KNOWN to make, or to go ahead and win by two. That's why our defense is tremendous, but our offense fluctuates, and why the big three's numbers are so fucking weird this season, but we are still winning games. 

HOWEVER, there are outside factors such as fatigue, injuries, actual missed shots, etc.  They are, after all, still human. But I think BD is going to allow 15 on purpose losses, then tell them to go out there and play. 

Tonight's win against the 6ers is a perfect example.  They were crushing it.  Especially Melo.  What happened when we took too big of a lead?  Westbrook all of the sudden stops passing to Melo. Then overtime got a little out of hand and it was almost an accidental loss.  However, Robes wasn't in on the secret, so he went for it, got the lay-up, and our two points.  PatPat came through with a huge block, and it was finally game over.  Everyone can breathe. 

Billy Donovan is a damn hustler and the only people that know are him and the big three.","Here's my fake conspiracy theory about how and why the thunder are playing like they are tl;dr  BD is a damn hustler

"I still can't get over how Indiana treated PG on his return.  I wish I could ask every single Pacers fan in the arena last night why they booed him. It felt like many of them were doing it, because it was the it thing to do. I saw a sign calling PG a snake and cupcake. I don't understand how PG is a snake when he handled the situation as professionally as he could have. He didn't blindside them. 

I see a lot of fans saying we're being hypocritical because we boo KD. I don't think other fans will ever understand the magnitude to what KD did to us. It's unfair to group PG in with that. 

And I also saw a comment saying that if someone just listened to the audio of how Pacers fans treated PG, they would swear it was the game where KD returned to OKC. I mean they could have at least been original and not call PG a snake and cupcake. Lol

Idk maybe someone else has some insight on why PG is being called a snake.","Why are Pacers fans calling PG a snake and why do Pacers fans want to be us so bad? I still can't get over how Indiana treated PG on his return.  I wish I could ask every single Pacers fan in the arena last night why they booed him.

""*The one thing I know in talking to those guys is, has our ball movement at times not been gret? Yes. But they're making a very conscious effort to move the ball.*

*My opinion, I think this is a huge adjustment for all those guys and the fact that sometimes they go possessions, whether free, four, five, six, seven, without ever touching the ball and now all of a sudden it comes back to them on the eight and they're open?*

*I'm not saying they shot it every time, but probably pretty much the ball was in their hands, they were making a play, making a shot, but they knew it was eventually coming back and I think that's an adjustment for those guys.*

*I think for Carmelo in particular, sometimes the ball gets hopped around and it finds him at the 3-point line open, but he hasn't touched it in four or five trips.*

*Now, that's something he has to get better at, because he's a pro, he's been unselfish, but I think that is the biggest thing. They've never, ever had to do a lot of this before because they were so responsible to carry teams.*

"With the poor start we've had to the season everyone has been looking for reasons as to why its happening. Whether it be Russ' lack of movement off ball, too much ISO, bad coaching, Melo starting. I think that with everyone so desperate to find reasons to explain what's going on, people have over-thought/over-analysed the situation.

&nbsp;

Russ has played the same way all of his career and has had success, reaching a finals as well as almost beating GSW a couple of years ago (I still believe if we didn't choke that lead we'd have won the championship) and Donovan has shown that he can take a team that far.

&nbsp;

At the start of the season the issue was that the offense was stagnant, we were taking bad shots because we couldn't create good looks. Recently I've noticed that's no longer an issue, we're getting good looks but just aren't making them. This is most likely due to confidence issues caused by our early season woes, but progress has most definitely been made.

&nbsp;

Tonight the big 3 shot horribly. Russ shot 3-17, PG shot 3-14 and Melo shot 4-14. If they shot at their usual efficiency it would have been a complete blow out. This applies for most losses we've had this season (especially in recent weeks.) The same applies to 2Pat and Abrines who're both shooting below career average FG% (Patterson is extremely under, shooting at almost a 10% lower rate.)

&nbsp;

All this team needs is to regain confidence, and we've got plenty of time to do so, we just need to win some games on the bounce and build up some momentum. By the time we reach the play-offs I'm certain we will be ready to compete with anyone. So enough of wanting to trade players away and give up on the season already, as frustrating as it may be lets just be patient. It only makes sense that things are going to get much, much better.","Why I'm super SUPER confident that this team will turn out good With the poor start we've had to the season everyone has been looking for reasons as to why its happening.

"Kind of a long post, but bear with me.... Recently it seems like people on here love to point to that season under Donovan as the benchmark for the Thunder's success in this new system. But taking a look back on it all, are we remembering it more favorably than we realize? 




- During the 2015-2016 season, we finished 3rd in the WCF with a record of 55-27. However, 16 of those 27 loses came from the Thunder blowing a 4th quarter lead with KD and Westbrook at the helm. 




- Everyone was calling for BD's head at one point or another for his mismanagement of the team's rotations during the regular season. To add on to that, the Thunder were blown out in game 1 of the 2nd round series against SA. How did the team respond?.. BD went big against SA and outcoached Pop the remaininder of the series and eventually took a 3-1 lead of GSW before losing out. 





- At the moment, a lot of NBA fans (in general) seem to think of KD as a the key piece to the Thunder's success in 2015-2016. They see him having a perfect fit in GSW and all the success he's having. But reading back on this article, KD wasn't the one pushing for ball movement... ""So who is to blame for these terrible finishes is it Billy Donovan? Russell Westbrook? Kevin Durant? Truth is everyone on the Oklahoma City Thunder is to blame for their poor execution which has led to a lack of identity. Watching the Oklahoma City Thunder play it looks like a pickup game where everyone is trying to score individually. Collectively there is no group conscious effort.

The team fails to run proper sets or get into a certain flow of their offense part of that is Billy Donovan not introducing complicated sets and Russell Westbrook speeding down trying to get the first available shot. If it is not Westbrook being ball dominant then we have Kevin Durant jacking up shots. The team concept is very weak in the OKC locker room and it is sad because they have a ton of talent."" http://www.hoopsjunction.com/responsible-oklahoma-city-thunder-blowing-leads/#sthash.0Hp9CTL7.dpbs






All of this to be said, it appears BD's system takes time to implement correctly during the regular season. However, the ball movement on this Thunder team is light year's ahead of where it was during the 2015-2016 season. Things will pick up, and shots will eventually fall but to be honest we don't need to do much more than get to the 6th or 7th seed.





Assuming the Rockets and Spurs finish 2nd and 3rd respectively, the Thunder's best bet for advancing through to the WCF would be to take the 6th/7th seed to match up against them on the way to play GSW. Right now, the Thunder operate best when we can play our 'small' ball lineup of Russ/Robes/PG/Melo/Adams as we don't have the depth at C to play bigger consistently. But this small ball lineup is the exact lineup it takes to defend teams like Houston. Getting to the 4th/5th seed and having to play Minn/NO/Den wouldn't put our team at an advantage matchup wise like it would if we finished the season at 6th/7th and played Houston and then SA before we took on GSW.

"I get it.  We all imagined a LeCoast to the 3 seed and had images of potentially taking down the Warriors on the way to a shot at the chip dancing in our heads.  But, even the most rational heads and biggest Melo haters couldn't have predicted it would look this bad.  And bad is mostly what it has looked, because the reality is we are 12-14 and in 9th place with 56 games left in the season.  Going 36-20 from here on out would still likely catch us at least a 6 seed, and that is highly attainable.  

I think the biggest points of conflict for the fans right now is; Billy Donovan, Russell Westbrook/Carmelo Anthony (rotating daily), and the bench.  

&nbsp;

1.Billy Donovan

While the focus of dissent for most of the season seemed to rotate between Melo, Westbrook, and Donovan, it seems that most fans have settled on Donovan as the main reason for our struggles.  The main complaints are that he; doesn't have an NBA level offensive system, doesn't have the personality to coach at the NBA level, Can't manage big egos, and he has poor rotations.  

*     A.  ""Billy Donovan doesn't have an NBA level system""

People complaining about Billy Donovan is nothing new.  I found [this fantastic post](https://us.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/3toqec/donovans_offense_or_why_westbrook_is_not_the/) from a couple of years ago while trying to find an old post of mine.  It links to [this collection of BD plays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5QhW-I5N0c).  You can also find a breakdown of his offense [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj4PIYuDe4c) and [here](https://bballbreakdown.com/2015/05/02/billy-donovan-brings-spread-pick-and-roll-offense-to-okc/).  

After digging pretty deeply into it, I have to agree with this criticism, BUT I can see why the Thunder hired him, which I will expand on in a moment.  If you watch the videos I linked above you will notice a very big similarity between the offense he ran in Florida and the offense her runs here.  It was very heavy on the Pick and Roll, with many plays running off a 1-5 high pick and roll looking for a switch to iso off of.  It was a lot of simple off ball movement with little to no off ball screening.  It was catered to having superior talent on the perimeter and abusing that talent creating mismatches off switches into iso's and penetrate-dish type plays.  Because it looked to iso of mismatches, it had a tendency to stagnate and bog down against superior defenses.

Does any of that sound familiar?  It should, because its the exact same offense he runs here.  I can completely understand why they got him though.  The plan was to run this offense with WB/KD, probably the two best iso creators in the league.  We can see how well it excelled in the playoffs when he was able to utilize all the weapons we had in different and creative ways.  I don't think hes a bad coach to be honest.  He can be quite crafty and clever.  I do think that our lineup in the 15-16 season was perfect for him though, and maybe we don't have enough talent now.  I can also see how they imagined Melo and PG thriving in this system.

*     B.  ""Billy Donovan doesn't have the personality to coach in the NBA/Manage superstar egos""

It is hard to argue with this one as well.  We all know about the infamous KD tweet throwing Donovan under the bus.  I don't necessarily think it was fair given the opportunity the team had under Donovan that season, but just that KD would even think that isn't a good look.  I really need to find this clip, but I remember Donovan getting onto Westbrook for a dumb foul early in the season/preseason and Westbrook just looked at him like a media member and gave a thumbs up.  I saw a post on here, and Steven A said it, where Melo called off a substitution.  Things like that aren't a good look.  

I also don't like his lack of emotion on the court and endless positivity with the media.  I think part of that comes from College.  You have a much shorter leash as a coach and protecting the ""children"" is a much bigger issue.  In the NBA you can definitely be more open, but you also have to worry about the Ego part.  That is the balance they must keep, but I think the player respect coaches who will get fired up and tell it like it is when necessary.  Again, on this aspect, I can totally see why they hired him.  He seems like the prototype for what ownership would want from a head coach personality wise.

*     C.  ""Billy Donovan has terrible rotations""

This is only here because it is kind of dumb.  Our bench has been pretty bad overall and is a general complaint I see constantly, but then Donovan gets dumped on for rotations.  Well yea, some of the rotations are bad because our bench is bad.  The regular season is all about figuring out what you are going to do in the playoffs.  You have to experiment.  You have to throw everything you can against the wall to see what sticks.  Most of it has slid straight down.  Our bench has one pure shooter with no D, a spot up shooter forced to play 5 where he has no D, a serviceable backup 1, a high energy defensive guy with no jumpshot who can hit straight lines to the basket, a couple of rookies, and guys like Slingler who have devolved into /NBA memes.  The rotations aren't going to be great, but we need to figure out what might be good now.

&nbsp;

2.Russell Westbrook/Carmelo Anthony

Lets face it.  Both of them are playing like hot garbage.  That is absolutely fair to say.  Westbrook has been able to receive a pass for all his flaws because of everything he brought to the table, but when hes not making mid range jumpers, and he can't finish at the rim, and he isn't drawing fouls, and he isn't making free throws, and hes shooting threes at a career high rate.... Yea, it is that bad.  You almost hope hes playing through an injury just as a way to explain how bad it has been.  I definitely think something is wrong with one of his knees.  He jumps notoriously high on his jump shots and he is consistently missing short.  I think hes not getting the same pop hes used to, hes shooting later in his jump than hes used to, and his shots are coming up shorter than hes used to.  It isn't good.  Hes never been a great finisher at the rim, but hes been especially bad this season and hes not getting foul calls.  I almost hope its an injury, because if this is peak Russ, we are in for a long couple of years.  Honestly, I want to say pretty much the same thing for Melo.  The difference is, Melo doesn't jump high on his jumpers.  He barely leaves the floor and its smooth as butter.  His shot has looked fine to me, as little as I have paid attention to that.  Melo is pretty much the prototype for players games who age well.  Hes never relied on athleticism.  He has struggled to score in the paint, which is a reflection of his age, but hes also been getting no calls while getting mauled.   

As depressing as that all was, if everything is fine, they almost have to start playing better at this point.  They are playing so far under the median that it feels unsustainable, like bizzaro on fire.  If we were hitting high quality open looks at a normal level we would have won 3-4 more games easily.  It could be as many as 5-6 games really.  We could just as easily be 15-11 and everyone would feel fine.  I know that isn't the reality, but its just something to think about for hope.  I think we have started to move the ball better, and we are getting open shots, and they have to start falling.  

&nbsp;

3.The Bench

I addressed most of this in the rotations part but we have to look at the facts.  The bench hasn't been great, and you can look to the composition of the team for reasons.  We drafted Sabonis to be the backup 5 when we inevitably got rid of Kanter.  Kanter was a piece of a different puzzle that could still put up numbers, but wasn't really in the future.  I don't really think McDermott was ever in our plans for the future.  Those are two pretty big components of our bench that we gave up.  We picked up as much talent as we could.  Felton and PPatt were big offseason signs, but weren't part of the plan.  Felton has fit, but PPatt is playing stretch 5 on a recovering knee and can't thrive in those conditions.  Grant is basically Roberson 2.0.  Abrines is a defensive liability, and hasn't proven to be a consistent shooter yet.  That is pretty much it for serviceable members of our bench.  We saw what Collison, Singler, and Ferguson have done with their limited minutes this season, and it hasn't been pretty.  We desperately need to make a move.  It also brings to question why we are spending money on singler and collison if they can't be a positive on the court at this point in their careers.  

&nbsp;

4.The Conclusion

Okay, so what does all of this mean?  Well, it means that there is hope.  Billy Donovan isn't completely incompetent, though it's likely at this point he isn't some hidden savant either.  We can look to his success in the playoffs, in his first season with a roster he was hand picked to lead, as hope for his ability to pull this all together.  Westbrook can be significantly better.  He doesn't even have to shoot better, he just has to play more fundamental basketball.  If he toned it down, moved off ball, cut, set screens, and made more solid passes, he would already be better without scoring.  That aint Russ so at the least we can expect him to shoot better.  Melo is an old dog who might not be able to learn new tricks.  Its hard to blame Donovan for not being able to handle this one.  Melo will have to accept the position hes in at this point of his career and really be comfortable with it.  Hes shown flashes of accepting a more role player role, but hes also shown flashes of completely rejecting that.  Similar to Russ, at the least we can expect him to shoot better. 

&nbsp;

tl;dr

Donovan kind of is the problem, kind of not.  The players are mostly following his system.  Westbrook has been really bad, could change fundamentals, but will likely just find a way to shoot better.  Melo has been really bad, could change fundamentals, but will likely just find a way to shoot better.  An achievable outlook is 36-20 to finish the season.","Talking about Billy Donovan, WB/Melo, and the bench I get it.

Felton and PPatt were big offseason signs, but weren't part of the plan.  Felton has fit, but PPatt is playing stretch 5 on a recovering knee and can't thrive in those conditions.  Grant is basically Roberson 2.0.  Abrines is a defensive liability, and hasn't proven to be a consistent shooter yet.  That is pretty much it for serviceable members of our bench.  We saw what Collison, Singler, and Ferguson have done with their limited minutes this season, and it hasn't been pretty.  We desperately need to make a move.  It also brings to question why we are spending money on singler and collison if they can't be a positive on the court at this point in their careers.  

&nbsp;

4.The Conclusion

Okay, so what does all of this mean?  Well, it means that there is hope.  Billy Donovan isn't completely incompetent, though it's likely at this point he isn't some hidden savant either.  We can look to his success in the playoffs, in his first season with a roster he was hand picked to lead, as hope for his ability to pull this all together.  Westbrook can be significantly better.  He doesn't even have to shoot better, he just has to play more fundamental basketball.  If he toned it down, moved off ball, cut, set screens, and made more solid passes, he would already be better without scoring.  That aint Russ so at the least we can expect him to shoot better.  Melo is an old dog who might not be able to learn new tricks.  Its hard to blame Donovan for not being able to handle this one.  Melo will have to accept the position hes in at this point of his career and really be comfortable with it.  Hes shown flashes of accepting a more role player role, but hes also shown flashes of completely rejecting that.  Similar to Russ, at the least we can expect him to shoot better. 

&nbsp;

tl;dr

Donovan kind of is the problem, kind of not.  The players are mostly following his system.  Westbrook has been really bad, could change fundamentals, but will likely just find a way to shoot better.  Melo has been really bad, could change fundamentals, but will likely just find a way to shoot better.  An achievable outlook is 36-20 to finish the season.",10,10,"Talking about Billy Donovan, WB/Melo, and the bench",https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/7jgyq7/talking_about_billy_donovan_wbmelo_and_the_bench/

"He's looked better these past couple of games but I wonder, could his efficiency and and overall effectiveness be improved if we change his role as a perimeter stretch 4 to more of an inside-the-arc kind of guy? I mean, we basically tried to do the same thing with Domas and it obviously didn't work and he's shining in Indiana now playing as a more traditional big (Note that he attempted two 3-pointers per game last year and this year in Indy he's averaging 0.4 per game).

"From this thread talking about team's best lineup so far in the season: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7jdq1n/oc_every_teams_best_lineup_so_far_in_the_1718/


""OKC Thunder: S.Adams, C.Anthony, P.George, A.Roberson, R.Westbrook

This lineup only wins because of sample size - 319 minutes. No other OKC Lineup has hit 70 minutes. That being said, this not a bad lineup. Their DRTG of 94.8 is one of the best starting groups in the league, but their shooting isn't great(52.8% TS).
One lineup they use swaps Grant for Adams and posted a +24.8 NET, but their absolute best line up is Abrines, Adams, George, Grant, and Westbrook. With a DRTG of 76.0, this is the fourth best defensive group in the league.

Their primary bench unit of Felton, Abrines, Grant, Patterson, and George, is one of the worst in the entire league with a negative 18.3 NET in 11 games. Swapping Roberson for Abrines, their second most utilized lineup, is also dreadful. Yet Donovan keeps going to these same line-ups game in and game out. The Thunder aren't losing because of their starters. They're losing because of their bench.""

"Okay so after every loss this sub explodes in threads with headlines like these. We're all frustrated, and we have different ways to cope with the losses, but in the end we all want the same thing which is Thunder success. 

Personally I think it's time to try Melo on the bench, especially way before we start seriously considering firing Billy Donovan. 

Melo has shown that he actually CAN play with the 1st unit (sometimes), but end goal needs to be what benefits the team first. It's important to note that this is not a shot on Melo, or using him as scapegoat. It might just be the solution, we'll never know until we try. Right now there is a tendency that our 2nd unit can't produce any points, and that combined with 3rd quarter collapses is just a big clusterfuck. 

Melo is 33 years old and is shooting career low percentages. Playing against other teams 2nd unit might help him get better look, shooting higher percentages, defending worse players etc. The Cavs succes right now can amongst other reasons be credited to DWade who comes off the bench with 22 productive minutes every game. 

With Melo coming off the bench you're spreading the offensive fire power without staggering the minutes too much. Melo has experience with Felton as well, and they might compliment each other.
