"How would you guys feel if Presti Signed Jimmer? He's a pretty good shooter that can go off the bench for Oladipo and he probably wont be that worth that much since he's not even in the NBA. So yeah just wondering what you guys think if this is a good idea or nah.

"Here is a list of starting-calibre small forwards we could realistically target over the next 12 months:

Wilson Chandler
Robert Covington 
Marcus Morris
Moe Harkless


Here of some other names I didn't include and why:

Rudy Gay: his achilles is a huge issue at his age and he is too ball dominant to play beside Russ.

TJ Warren: Great scoring from short range, but only shoots 31% from 3, and 26% this past season. If the Thunder coaches think they can improve his 3-point shot then maybe he's worth a look.

Jae Crowder: As another post mentioned, Hayward to Boston would put Crowder on the market, and it would be fantastic if we could get him, but OKC are unlikely to have the assets to interest the Celtics.

Danilo Gallinari: He is getting paid well north of 20 million a year as a free agent this off season, OKC cannot afford him.

Nicolas Batum: Charlotte ain't trading him.

Otto Porter: He's getting paid by Washington this offseason. 

Tobias Harris: Detroit would trade Morris before Harris.

Andrew Wiggins: I don't see the TWolves trading him, and his defence isn't great, and his efficiency is worse than Harkless.

PG13/Butler/Hayward: Dreams are free.


Likely OKC trade assets:

Enes Kanter
2017 #21 pick to trade after the draft
2019 1st round pick to trade before the draft
Andre Roberson from January 2018 provided we retain him but can't trade him to a team that signs an offer sheet.
Josh Huestis

Unlikely OKC trade assets:

Anyone except for Russ, but when you're looking for a small forward the standard of what we can realistically get, if you trade our other assets like Abrines, Doug, Grant etc, you get weaker in other areas to get better at the 3. For the right guy I'd consider trading Doug if Huestis could realistically be our back up 3 next year, but not sure. 

Singler is obviously a negative trade asset.

So, the question is, with the trade assets we have available, what chance in hell do we have of getting one of the 4 names at the top before the start of the 2018-19 season?

"Trade Kanter to Portland for Evan Turner and one of their firsts. The contract we had to match for Kanter wasn't just offered by Portland to fuck with us, maybe they actually wanted Kanter and thought we wouldn't match? They've also said they were shopping one of their firsts for a younger player and enes is young. Evan Turners contract is pretty bad so we could maybe get Portland to give us 15 and ET. 

Why do we do it? This draft is really deep 4-10 and I think we could figure out a way to swing 15 and 21 to in the top ten. It looks like no matter how it falls 1-10 you're getting a good player and it'd be young talent on a rookie contract so it could balance out the ET contract. Also we get a playmaking, decent defender, better shooter than Roberson (not saying much) small forward. He could play point too and create offense. 

Underrated aspect of any Kanter trade,we could have sabonis takes Kanters role who I think fits what we are trying to do with Kanter better. The playmaking 5 role is what he excelled at for Gonzaga and he was a pretty good defender for a rookie last year.

"We badly need a backup point guard.  I'm afraid that Westbrook will blow a fuse if Semaj is his primary backup for another year.  Maybe we can get someone in free agency but our options look fairly limited there, thus it's natural to look to the draft.

Let's look at our criteria:

* NBA ready, so we don't waste Westbrook's prime

* strong 3pt shooting to address a team weakness and allow minutes next to Russ

* solid defense as this team needs to keep its top-10 defense status

* high character

As luck would have it, Frank Mason meets all criteria and should be available when we pick.  Heck, due to the over-infatuation with drafting 19yr old kids not ready to contribute, we might even be able to trade down to get Frank.

I know I know, the dude is short (6' with shoes on) and I agree that limits his overall upside.  But we don't need him to be a superstar - we just need a good backup PG.  If he turns into our JJ Barea then I'm fine with that.  Plus, elite athleticism can help compensate for lack of size and Frank definitely has that as indicated by his 41"" vertical at the Combine.  Also he can do this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL1p-byYCAg&app=desktop

Did I mention the guy's a dead-eye shooter?  47% from 3 in his senior year on 4.8 attempts/game.  And that's no fluke either as he averaged 42% over 4 years.  I'd say he projects to shoot 40% from 3, or close to it, in the NBA.  Along with his shooting he has a good handle, solid playmaking (2.1 AST/TOV ratio), and excellent speed running the break.

Probably defense will be Frank's biggest challenge in the NBA.  He does have excellent lateral quickness, decent strength, and that ""bulldog"" mentality which will help a lot.  If nothing else I think he'll be a better defender than Cam Payne :-)

Regarding character, I think this video gives a nice insight:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDw3flSar-E

Frank won the John Wooden award and was described by Bill Self as ""the best guard I've ever coached"".  I think he'd be a big upgrade over Semaj.  Doesn't seem like a typical Presti pick but I live in hope.","Why the Thunder should draft Frank Mason We badly need a backup point guard.

And get some future (like 3-5 years away) picks and swaps that make sense when Lebron retires or chases another ring somewhere else.",7,0,"Blah, blah, blah, another Trade",https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/6fyqlg/blah_blah_blah_another_trade/
"I sit here after doing everything in my power to cheer for the cavs in this series since I'm from Ohio. But I grew up following Durant in his career and stuck with him wherever he went. Watching him play for the Thunder was my favorite thing because although they weren't favorites, it was fun and entertaining and then bring Westbrook into the mix and I was set. I had never been happier.

Watching these finals reminded me why I loved the Thunder. Seeing a team who was the underdogs play and play to their potential was amazing. Last year we had the Warriors beat and lost the lead. I thought he wouldn't betray us after having the famous 73 win team beat. He left and I decided that I wasn't about following such a cowardly move and that I will support the Thunder until the day I die. 

That being said, I can't wait to watch the Thunder next season and all of the challenges they face being in the western conference. Here's to a great offseason and an even better 2018 season, we've got this.

"I am a Celtics fan, but my brother goes to school in Oklahoma- so we're both partial to OKC. You guys all know that several massive contracts are holding you back from adding important pieces via trade or free agency- namely Kanter and to a lesser extent Oladipo and Adams.

I've read a dozen threads with trade ideas pitching Kanter to other teams- including some to my Celtics- and it needs to be understood: Kanter is NOT a desirable player.

Bigs in the modern NBA need to be able to either 1) defend and rebound like the devil or 2) shoot the long ball at over 35%. Kanter does neither of these things, and gets paid 4 years, 70 million a year to do neither of these things. No other team is going to give you anything of value for him, especially a team with cap space available to absorb him. You're not going to get a first rounder for him. You're not going to get a serviceable backup point guard for him.

To get rid of him and give yourself flexibility going forward, you're going to need to package him with an asset to get other teams to take the plunge. If you wait out his deal, your timeline gets messed up and you've wasted Westbrook's prime years. If you can get rid of him, you might be able to make a splash in free agency despite the small market location.

Without moving Kanter, the Thunder are stuck on the treadmill of mediocrity for the duration of Westbrook's contract(s). They can't compete with the top teams in the West but will make the playoffs and hence not get good draft picks to improve internally. 

So here's my pitch. If you can't move Kanter / are unwilling to give up assets to entice another team to take him on, you should consider moving your REAL assets- Westbrook, Adams, and Oladipo- for future picks and/or high-ceiling young pieces. Your rebuild timeline would have you emerge as contenders after the Warriors age and break up- in 8-9 years time. 

In other words, the future direction of your franchise may well hinge on whether Presti can unload Kanter's deal and start building a win-now contender. If he can't, OKC might be due for a blow up.

Your rebuild timeline would have you emerge as contenders after the Warriors age and break up- in 8-9 years time. 

In other words, the future direction of your franchise may well hinge on whether Presti can unload Kanter's deal and start building a win-now contender. If he can't, OKC might be due for a blow up. ",26,0,Consider a rebuild,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/6f0pn8/consider_a_rebuild/
"Hey r/Thunder just wanted to say I'm a new Thunder fan and I'm looking forward to participating in this subreddit! I've been watching the NBA pretty much after the all star break in 2013-14 but never picked a team to support. I'm from Australia.

I've always been a huge fan of Westbrook and decided it was about time to pick a team. Also, my high school teammate is a huge Thunder fan. He's Steven Adams' nephew and moved to Australia 2 years ago. I just had a couple of questions about the team:

1. Do you think the Thunder have a good chance of signing Blake Griffin this offseason? I've heard a lot of rumours.

2. Do you think Westbrook will try to average a triple double next year as well?

Thanks guys.

"For this to work, Chris Paul must commit on playing in San Antonio. Chain of events, Blake won't want to play in a ""rebuilding"" team and going to his hometown is fitting.

~~ Trade Proposal Summary/TLDR ~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thunder loses Oladipo, Kanter, Gibson

Clippers loses Paul, Redick, Griffin

Spurs loses Aldridge, Mills

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thunder receives Griffin, Redick, Mills

Clippers receives Oladipo, Aldridge

Spurs receives Paul, Gibson, Kanter

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



The most important part of this trade is getting Westbrook a number 2 who can complement him. OKC is built for RW **and** KD so losing KD took a big step backwards for us. Now that we are rebuilding for Russ, Blake is a great complementary player for him. Redick's a great floor spacer for the team as well. We get a legit backup for Russ in Patty Mills. I believe we can also pay for Roberson with Gibson leaving.

We can sign and trade Gibson to Spurs. Him having a bigger paycheck and going to *the* Spurs is actually a win-win situation for both parties I believe. We also get rid of Kanter's fat check and Oladipo has never really been a great number 2 for us.

As for Clippers, the moment CP3 decides to leave Clippers, it will be rebuilding time. Getting Oladipo and LMA is a big help for them to maintain their relevane in the league. Sure it will be a gamble but these 2 guys are having a subpar performance in their new respective teams. If Clippers gets a Magic-Oladipo and Blazers-Aldridge, together with DeAndre, it'll be a playoff bound team. Besides, LMA wanted to become Number 1 which obviously he won't get in Spurs. This is his team.

For Spurs, getting CP3 will take a fortune for them. Getting rid of LMA's contract will be okay. He's having a subpar performance anyway. Gibson will be the perfect replacement for them. A scrappy player who'll get the work done. Having Kanter off the bench just adds more depth to this team. I believe he'll do wonders under Pop and CP3-run offense.

Our depth chart would be

> Westbrook Mills Christon

> Redick Abrines

> Roberson McDermott

> Griffin Grant

> Adams Sabonis

"After Presti traded Harden it was obvious the Thunder had a huge whole at SG. Or did Presti really think that Jeremy Lamb was going to be the SG of the future?

2012 - Drafted Perry Jones at #28.  I don't understand this pick. Why not draft a PF/C since it was obvious that Perkins was too slow to play against the Heat? Even if Perry Jones panned out, he would not be ready to play playoff basketball for another 3 years. 

Players available at #28 - Jae Crowder, Festus Ezeli, Draymond Green, Will Barton. 

Bottom Line - Don't understand why Presti went for a high ceiling high risk pick at #28. Especially since OKC was officially a contender after making the Finals. IMO, Presti should have drafted a big man who could help right away or trade the pick for a SG who could join the rotation right away. The PJ3 pick seemed like a pick a team like 76ers would make.  OKC did not have to make big risks. They already had their Super Star core, they just needed solid role players.

2013 - #12 Steven Adams. Great pick.  #26 Andre Roberson. 

Players available at #26 - Allen Crabbe. It was obvious at this point that Jeremy Lamb was a bust. Why not draft a wing who can shoot and defend? Crabbe was the obvious pick. Roberson was a PF in college and could never shoot.  

Bottom Line - I don't understand the Roberson pick. It was obvious that small ball was the future and OKC had a massive hole at SG. Again traded this pick for a solid SG was an option I wish OKC considered. 

2014 - #21 Mitch McGary.  #29 Josh Huestis.  Horrible draft picks. Don't understand these at all.  At this point the hole at SG was as large as the ocean. And OKC desperately needed wing help.

Players available at #21, #29 - Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, Kyle Anderson.  On draft day I was hoping OKC would select Hood. He would have been PERFECT playing with KD/Russ.  The McGary pick made no sense since they already had Adams/Ibaka.  Blows my mind. Then the Huestis pick was beyond horrible. Guy probably would have gone undrafted if OKC didn't pick him.  

Bottom Line - Hood was there for the taking. It was the obvious pick for a position OKC desperately needed. But even if OKC didn't believe in Hood they should have packaged those 2 picks and moved up or traded them for a SG/Wing.

2015 - #14 Cameron Payne. Never understood what Presti saw in this guy.

Players available at #14 - Kelly Oubre, Terry Rozier, Sam Dekker, Bobby Portis.

Bottom Line - This was a bad pick. No other way to say it.  Kelly Oubre was the obvious pick. Again, OKC had a huge hole to fill at SG. But what made more sense was to trade this pick for a vet who could help right away at the wing. 

Conclusion - Presti has made some amazing picks. Westbrook was not an obvious choice.  Ibaka was a steal.  Reggie Jackson was a steal.  KD was obvious and Harden was a solid choice (most mocks had him in that slot).

But ever since OKC made the Finals they made some questionable picks for the circumstances they were in.  It seemed like Presti simply selected the best player available instead of guys that would fit the needs of the team. He seemed to pick high ceiling guys instead of guys who could help right away.

"I have narrowed down potential Russ trades (if that sad day should ever occur) to three teams (that could legitimately consider it). 2017-2018 salaries are listed.  Russ has a salary of 28.5.

Which would you prefer?

* **Blow it all up trading with the Celtics?**
* **Stay competitive with a new core trading with the Hornets?**
* **Get a ready-made young core trading with the Lakers?**


**Boston Celtics** (28)

* Isaiah Thomas (6.2) expiring
* Avery Bradley (8.8) expiring
* Jaylon Brown (5.0) 
* Tyler Zeller (8.0) Non-Guaranteed
* Nets 2018 pick

**Boston reasoning**

They get Russ to pair up with the core of Horford, Crowder and Smart.  Then Boston could better lure Gordon Hayward in free agency and could trade #1 overall and sweetener for Jimmy Butler.

This would give them Westbrook, Butler, Hayward, Horford, Olynyk with Smart and Rozier off the bench.  Boston would be ready to run for a championship during Horford’s golden years and Butler, Hayward and Russ are on the same time table.  

**OKC reasoning** 

This gives the Thunder a lot of flexibility moving forward.  Thomas and Bradley could be trade assets and Brown would be a great piece to add to our core.  Zeller wouldn’t be brought back but that Nets 2018 pick and any additional picks would be amazing to move forward toward the next chapter.

This would give us to build around/with

* PG - Nothing, but maybe our 2017 1st Rd pick?
* SG - Oladipo, Abrines 
* SF - Jaylon Brown, McDermott
* PF - Sabonis, Grant
* C - Adams, Kanter (potentially traded)
* Potential 1st Rd picks/young players for Thomas and Bradley if we don’t see them on our squad moving forward.


**Charlotte Hornets** (34.4 incoming, 35 outgoing)

* Kemba Walker (12)
* Nicholas Batum (22.4)
For 
* Westbrook (28.4)
* Singler (4.6 although they would surely stretch this)
* 2017 1st Rd Pick

**Charlotte reasoning**

MJ gets his favorite player and will try to convince him to stay.  Westbrook, Kaminsky, Williams and MKG would be their core (glad we aren’t them) and they would have their pick (11) and our pick (21) to trade for pieces or use to fill out their roster.

**OKC reasoning**

We get rid of the haircut!!! This takes care of our biggest hole (SF) and we don’t lose a ton dropping down from Westbrook to Walker.  Batum (28) and Walker (27) are just ahead of the rest of our team’s timeline but would keep us competitive.

This would give us to build around/with

* PG - Walker
* SG - Oladipo, Abrines
* SF - Batum, McDermott
* PF - Sabonis, Grant (bring back Taj?)
* C - Adams, Kanter (trade for a backup PG?)

This actually would give us a team that would be on-par or better than last season.  We would be a lock for top-4 next year.


**Los Angeles Lakers** (28)

* D’Angelo Russell (5.5)
* Brandon Ingram (5.5)
* Luol Deng (17.1 as salary filler)
* #2 pick overall in 2017

**LAL reasoning**

Although they would be losing young pieces in Russell, Ingram and the pick, they would be getting Westbrook and likely Paul George next free agency.  They would have a core of Westbrook, George, Randle, Nance Jr. and Clarkson to move forward with.  This could become a veteran minimum haven for other free agents as Magic could get some enthusiasm around this team again right as the Clippers are in the decline.

**OKC reasoning**

Although that Deng contract is tough pill to swallow, we would get three young pieces to build with that are similar to the same timeline as the rest of our core.

This would give us to build around/with

* PG - D’Angelo Russell
* SG - Oladipo, Abrines
* SF - Ingram, McDermott
* PF - Sabonis, Grant
* C - Adams, Kanter
* #2 and #21 overall in this year’s draft.  Maybe package Kanter and #21 to move up and fill two needs?

REMEMBER!  I'm not saying I want to trade Russ.  I want him to sign that extension and remain a member of the Thunder family for the rest of his career.  If the worst case scenario were to occur, I just want us to get something for him and these seem like possible destinations for him.  What do y'all think?

"Blake Griffin is clearly one of the best free agents available. 

He's one of the league's most talented players. He's athletic, he can play in the post, he's improved greatly his jump shot, he's an underrated passer and he's got great ball handling skills for a PF. 

I remember watching him play the whole 1st round against the Spurs in 2014. He was the best player on the court for most of the series. 

Unfortunately his career never took off as expected. Since then he suffered too many injuries. 

His time with the Clippers is over. He may really leave LA this summer.

The Thunder need to add a great player. Hayward would be the best fit, but he's also much harder to get. Blake could really be the answer. He needs to start back again from zero; imo he would form a great combination with Russ. 

However this would be a risky move: he's injury prone, his character and leadership are questionable. 

It's better to try to be competitive by getting Blake than mantaining the same core. If we manage to trade Kanter, resign Gibson and replace Roberson - who mustn't be resigned imo - things could be interesting next year.

"So as we all know, Sam Presti likes to pick his players carefully to fit OKC's team 'culture'.

- Adams: one of the most down-to-earth guys in the league that i know of

- Gibson: one of the most respected players across the league in general

Hey all, I'm a nuggets fan and I was pondering the possibility of our teams exchanging some pieces. Russel Westbrook is a god, but you have a lot of holes in your roster - particularly in your bench.

Kanter has turned into an albatross of a contract as you're effectively paying 40 million over 2 years for a bench player that can't play against quality competition due to the ease of exploiting his deficiencies on the defensive side of the ball. He is eating up a ton of your cap room and removing the possibility of finding complimentary pieces through free agency. To make things even more complicated, he is excellent against bad teams and lineups that cannot exploit him. For this reason, he becomes less attractive to tanking lottery teams that might be interested in taking him off your hands if you gave them your draft pick. For example, most lottery teams would prefer a 8 pick over a 9 and 21 pick (if one spot is all that they improve by), let alone taking that risk for two consecutive years. 

Sabonis looks like he'll be a productive backup 4 or 5 with solid intangibles that the nuggets would be interested in adding to their roster. 

Jameer Nelson would perhaps be the starkest upgrade in the deal as your current backup pg situation is nothing short of pathetic. He can shoot from 3 point land better than your entire roster, and can orchestrate successfully on the offensive side of the ball. He is a poor defender. 
http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/n/nelsoja01.html

Wilson chandler is an extremely versatile player who is at least average at essentially everything. He can play the 3 or 4 in either the starting or backup lineups. He can also score on reasonable volume, especially while exploiting mismatches. 
http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/chandwi01.html

Will Barton is an excellent 6th man who is a solid producer off the bench and is very good at scoring in isolation. He's the first one to practice and the last one out. Hopefully Russ could sit down for a second and not have the game completely fall apart the instant his Butt touches the bench with Barton on your squad. 
http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bartowi01.html

It is certainly unpalatable to lose a past 11th pick, and I would expect your pick this year to be included in the deal, but you guys are trying to win now and need to make some moves to show Russ that you can put a team around him. If he doesn't re-sign then you don't need me to tell you how bad that is for your team. Beyond that, it isn't healthy for him to have to play as much as he did this past year. It risks shortening his career or god forbid getting hurt. I think this trade could make sense for both parties in that you get some solid role players while getting rid of kanter, while the nuggets add another young piece in preparation for an eventual deep playoff run. 

Sorry for the long post, love your guys team, and I would really enjoy watching these current nuggets on your roster while you beat up the west next year.   Good luck with your future endeavors, and I hope next year is better for your team. 

What do you guys think about this trade?

"Considering the limited cap space, which of the following would you choose if you could only have one:

1. Sign Roberson to a 4 year/$60 million deal.  Let Taj walk.  No FA splash.
2. Sign Taj to a 2 year/$34 million deal (based off J. Noah's contract with the Knicks ~$18 mil). Let Robes walk.
3. Sign Rudy Gay to a 2 year/$38 million deal (he just left Sacramento with $14.2 mil guaranteed on the table).  Let Robes and Taj walk.

Personally, I think I would wait and see on the following items before deciding:

What does the RFA market hold for Andre?  I would NOT overpay for him.  VO and SA contracts won't allow it.
How is Gay's recovery coming?  Is he the same player?  Averaged nearly 18ppg/6rpg for his career, but he is 30 now.
Can Taj develop into a more consistent offensive option?  That will be key.

"Guys! Let's not forget about the OKC Rudy Gay scenario! If Woj reports it, it is more than likely more than a rumor. Can't you see it? Imagine a world where Russ and Rudy rule the NBA, and become the most criticized team in the league by National Media, Zach Lowe, etc... but also the most fun! The Ringer will have a field day, enough content to sink a ship. Imagine a top 4 seed in the West w/ Rudy Gay and Russell Westbrook.

He's got a decent 3 point shot, and really excelled even though we played him at every position but PG. I think he will come back next year a lot stronger.


Dipo - Vic struggled this year, but I'm attributing that to a new team with a new role, and no prior playoff experience. He's gonna put in a lot of work this offseason. From his exit interview it seemed like he was really disappointed with his performance and wants to come out and prove himself next year. He's got all the talent to be our second option, he just needs to believe it. He's gonna be working out with Russ again this offseason and I can only imagine that will help.

***""IT WAS HIS CHOICE ALONE TO MAKE""***

The aftermath of Kevin Durant’s decision to sign with the Warriors follows a predictable arc. It begins, as with most stories of redemption, at a low. [Contempt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sMa5fl9YGQ) still [abounds](https://twitter.com/hashtag/fuckkd?f=tweets&vertical=default&lang=en). But time heals all, and the rehabilitation has begun.

We’re told that there’s nothing wrong with Durant's decision. He wanted to try something new, he wanted to embed himself in a more exciting, opportunity-rich market. Who are we to judge a man who chooses the shimmer of San Francisco over the backwater of Oklahoma City? After all, this was a personal decision - a decision a man has every right to make for himself and his family.

We’re told that he had to endure a shared a court with Westbrook, leaving Durant to watch more (both [the greatness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gf68nmhqLQ) and [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63eaPylpWbw) [squandering](https://streamable.com/5u3n)) and act less, even as the better player. We’re told that Lebron created a superteam (twice), and has long since been forgiven.^1 Durant simply wanted to win, and he did what anyone who wants to win enough would do. Anyone implying that Durant took the coward’s way out - that joining the Warriors wasn’t “the right way” - is wrongheaded. They’re bloviating faux-macho hacks or whiny, covetous keyboard clowns. Both are pathetic as they rail against perceived wrongs they can’t control.

We’re told there is no fair basis to question Durant and his decision (The only minor exception is for the dedicated Oklahoma City fan. In that case you don’t have to like it, but you do have to empathize with it and admit he’s a good guy.

&nbsp;


***MODES OF BEING AND BASKETBALL***

For at least some of us, sports are more than a game.^2 Sports and the visceral competition they embody are an important part of what it is to be a human being. In this way, we might think of sports as an aesthetic and humanistic enterprise, as analogous to art, [literature](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7125756-fiction-s-about-what-it-is-to-be-a-fucking-human), music, or even love. Sports act, as those other endeavors do, as fundamental human goods, as part of the stuff that makes life worth living.  

Like all social institutions, sports have their own mode: their own code of conduct, their own sphere of performance (let’s call this the “mode of competition” or the “mode of sports”). In this mode, it is acceptable - no, it is desirable - for us to hate our opponents. We embrace us versus them. We disdain betrayal. We tribalize. We aspire to achieve greatness, and achieving greatness means starting from somewhere that isn’t the top. In the mode of competition, we are constituents of a group bound by a banner.  We are not life coaches or financial advisors. Empathy for other competitors, their friends, their families, and their cities is not our purview, at least in this mode of being.^3

Before this devolves into advocacy for sports-oriented feudalism and city militias warring on gameday,^4 it’s worth stating the obvious. When we interact with people in our lives, we do so in a variety of modes. We adopt different social strictures when ordering a beer than when we enter the subway. Those modes of being are then quickly cast aside when it’s time for work, a mode which is just as quickly put away when we see a romantic partner. So, this is not to argue that the competitive mode should supersede all others.

It is to argue that there are instances in which the competitive mode can and should be embraced. And in that mode, Kevin Durant sidelined competition in favor of other considerations. In the competitive mode, Durant acted as a coward.

That does not entail that KD is a coward in all aspects of being. It’s certainly possible to relate to athletes beyond the paradigm of a sports fan or competitor.

&nbsp;

***SHOULD YOU EVER BOO A NICE BASKETBALL PLAYER?***

Consider the passing of Chyna Thomas, Isaiah Thomas’ sister. The [photo](http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/04/avery-bradley-isaiah-thomas-sister-death-chyna-boston-celtics-chicago-bulls-nba-playoffs) of Avery Bradley consoling Thomas magnified the raw humanness of his pain. In the moments after seeing the photo, I thought of catching IT practice on Tacoma courts, of watching him goof around with Nate Robinson in a Seattle summer league. I remembered walking down to the court of a small college gym. I remembered standing as close to him as I could without being noticed to see if I could get a read on his actual height.

Those inconsequential run-ins were the most immediate and personal moments I’ve had with IT (though personal is strong - there is no way he remembers me). All the same, they were moments in which we shared a space and he performed his bewitching craft for a relatively intimate audience. The fact that in a moment of tragedy, my first thoughts about Thomas concerned not a competitor, but the suffering of a fellow human and the mundane moments we shared, makes clear that some things vastly outweigh sports and its mores, no matter how highly one values the mode of competition.   

Some modes of being matter to us - and should matter to us - more than others. And just as we should empathize with athletes as people, we should not let the mode of competition blind us to athletes' immorality. The sports page abounds with examples of quintessential competitors who behave in [questionable](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/06/09/donut-shop-employee-said-drunk-golden-tate-stole-donuts-keys/), [unacceptable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaxico_Burress#Legal_troubles), and [evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Hernandez#Legal_issues) ways. Except for the most grievous violations, athletes, particularly highly skilled athletes, tend to escape serious consequences.^5  We are right to lament that athletes too often get away with too much, seemingly only because they are embraced by a culture that looks the other way, as long as the on-the-field results are there. It’s all to show that great competitors can be far from great people.

Whether enduring hardship or committing crime, athletes are people first. Happenings in the ""mode of being a decent human"" will always matter more than those concerning competition.   But how much overall moral weight should we place on decisions that occurred in the competitive mode, when athletes were acting not as other day-to-day people, but as athletes qua athletes?

At least some. Competition, taken seriously, carries the normative weight of other existential human pursuits. As long as one purports to be a member of the community that cares about competition, we should expect him to adopt its code. That means always trying your hardest. That means never quitting. That means doing all you can to win, except cheating. That means loyalty to your teammates. And especially, it means never taking the easy way out.

It’s easy to view those norms as stupidly earnest jock-talk - if you can’t entertain the thought of taking them seriously, then discussions about the morality of the competitive mode are not for you. I am unashamed to say that, as a competitor and a fan, I take those norms seriously. They are the foundation of competition, an institution I love.  

So when Kevin Durant elected to join the Golden State Warriors - the team of the reigning MVP, the team that had narrowly beaten him after overcoming a 3 -1series deficit, the team favored to win the next NBA title without him - he eschewed an essential competitive principle. Whatever his other reasons, as a competitor, Durant failed. As a competitor, he acted as a coward. 

The “coward” label isn’t heartless or misanthropic. That criticism presupposes that we view Durant as a neighbor or acquaintance, some regular guy.^6 Rather, fans view him and adjudicate his actions as a competitor, just as they should be expected to. We are not compelled to think of KD as another soul at the bus stop doing the best he can to make his way. He’s not that soul, and that’s not the mode of being he’s chosen to occupy. He is someone who tries to win and purports to compete, a willing player in the mode of competition.

As for Durant’s overall moral status? He’s likely a decent man.  There is little reason to think otherwise. I wish him no ill-will, and if tragedy strikes him or those he cares about, he will be in my thoughts. The weightier happenings of life supersede the concerns of the competitive mode. As a human, just as all of us, he deserves empathy and respect.

This, however, remains: it is not inconsistent to view an athlete as occupying multiple modes of being. Those modes bleed into and interact with one another, and while some modes (e.g. global citizen mode, husband mode, father mode) matter more than others, together they sum to an identity.

And as a competitor, Durant took the easy way. Yes, it’s true: he had every right to make his choice. And we, in the mode of the competitor, have every right to disdain him for it.

FOOTNOTES

(1) Yeah, I don’t forgive him.

(2) And for some of us, they’re not. If you don’t like sports or competition, you won’t get any argument from me.  Some people don’t like books either, and while I don’t really get it, I don’t have much issue with people enriching their lives with whatever it is that they do like. Maybe horses or something.

(3) Perhaps there are other modes of sports fandom, modes in which the participants are there less for winning and more for fun. The atmosphere in this mode is almost certainly less heated, and you smile at the competition while competing. There may be a few testy (even heated!) moments of competitive flare, but that’s really not the point. The point it just having a good time and, ya know, breaking a sweat with some cool people. If that’s a mode of being that people want to embrace, you have no argument from me. But it is not a mode of being that captures the raw, humanistic elements that I ascribe the competitive mode (or at least it doesn’t for me).    

(4) But if it does come to this, I might have to become a Spurs fan. (Yeah, I know the entire article is about not changing you allegiances, but if it’s do or die, you gotta look out for number one. One six-shooter and your blackest pair of cowboy boots, please). Pop just inspires confidence as a leader of men, and I’m thinking he’ll be tactically sound as well. Plus, he’s got an [ally](http://i.imgur.com/8sRR3cf.jpg) on the seas.

(5) Not that grievous behavior can’t also be ignored. Just ask some of the women at [Baylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baylor_University_sexual_assault_scandal).

(6) I get that it’s totally absurd / laughably presumptuous to say what I would have done in KD’s shoes, but I think it’s worth saying I may very well would have left. In fact, I almost definitely would have left OKC. Sorry, Oklahoma, but life’s short, and I’ve got lifestyle concerns. I do, however, like to think that I wouldn’t leave for the team that so narrowly defeated me. To me, that eschewing of competitiveness is the real sin, and a sin I would hope I could avoid. 

(7) Sports media often makes this and similar claims, in which athletes who make unpopular competitive decisions are lauded for off-the-field work. That’s probably the results of a number of factors (return to glory and behind the scenes narratives are always nice), but another may have to with how people in sports media view athletes. In sports media, athletes become a sort of occasional colleague, and in some cases acquaintances or friends. If that’s the case, it becomes more difficult to talk in terms of cowardness (lost-access, awkwardness, ruffled feathers). What’s more, fans claiming “coward” are more easily viewed as a heartless mob, even if those chants are less personal and more a defense of a cherished set of values e.g. the competitive mode.

We’re told that he had to endure a shared a court with Westbrook, leaving Durant to watch more (both [the greatness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gf68nmhqLQ) and [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63eaPylpWbw) [squandering](https://streamable.com/5u3n)) and act less, even as the better player. We’re told that Lebron created a superteam (twice), and has long since been forgiven.^1 Durant simply wanted to win, and he did what anyone who wants to win enough would do. Anyone implying that Durant took the coward’s way out - that joining the Warriors wasn’t “the right way” - is wrongheaded. They’re bloviating faux-macho hacks or whiny, covetous keyboard clowns. Both are pathetic as they rail against perceived wrongs they can’t control.

We’re told there is no fair basis to question Durant and his decision (The only minor exception is for the dedicated Oklahoma City fan. In that case you don’t have to like it, but you do have to empathize with it and admit he’s a good guy. Additionally, you should be thankful for what you [did receive](http://thunderousintentions.com/2017/02/11/kevin-durant-return-watch/).

***MODES OF BEING AND BASKETBALL***

For at least some of us, sports are more than a game.^2 Sports and the visceral competition they embody are an important part of what it is to be a human being. In this way, we might think of sports as an aesthetic and humanistic enterprise, as analogous to art, [literature](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7125756-fiction-s-about-what-it-is-to-be-a-fucking-human), music, or even love. Sports act, as those other endeavors do, as fundamental human goods, as part of the stuff that makes life worth living.  

Like all social institutions, sports have their own mode: their own code of conduct, their own sphere of performance (let’s call this the “mode of competition” or the “mode of sports”). In this mode, it is acceptable - no, it is desirable - for us to hate our opponents. We embrace us versus them. We disdain betrayal. We tribalize. We aspire to achieve greatness, and achieving greatness means starting from somewhere that isn’t the top. In the mode of competition, we are constituents of a group bound by a banner.  We are not life coaches or financial advisors. Empathy for other competitors, their friends, their families, and their cities is not our purview, at least in this mode of being.^3

Before this devolves into advocacy for sports-oriented feudalism and city militias warring on gameday,^4 it’s worth stating the obvious. When we interact with people in our lives, we do so in a variety of modes. We adopt different social strictures when ordering a beer than when we enter the subway. Those modes of being are then quickly cast aside when it’s time for work, a mode which is just as quickly put away when we see a romantic partner. So, this is not to argue that the competitive mode should supersede all others.

It is to argue that there are instances in which the competitive mode can and should be embraced. And in that mode, Kevin Durant sidelined competition in favor of other considerations. In the competitive mode, Durant acted as a coward.

That does not entail that KD is a coward in all aspects of being. It’s certainly possible to relate to athletes beyond the paradigm of a sports fan or competitor.

&nbsp;

***SHOULD YOU EVER BOO A NICE BASKETBALL PLAYER?***

Consider the passing of Chyna Thomas, Isaiah Thomas’ sister. The [photo](http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/04/avery-bradley-isaiah-thomas-sister-death-chyna-boston-celtics-chicago-bulls-nba-playoffs) of Avery Bradley consoling Thomas magnified the raw humanness of his pain. In the moments after seeing the photo, I thought of catching IT practice on Tacoma courts, of watching him goof around with Nate Robinson in a Seattle summer league. I remembered walking down to the court of a small college gym. I remembered standing as close to him as I could without being noticed to see if I could get a read on his actual height.

Those inconsequential run-ins were the most immediate and personal moments I’ve had with IT (though personal is strong - there is no way he remembers me). All the same, they were moments in which we shared a space and he performed his bewitching craft for a relatively intimate audience. The fact that in a moment of tragedy, my first thoughts about Thomas concerned not a competitor, but the suffering of a fellow human and the mundane moments we shared, makes clear that some things vastly outweigh sports and its mores, no matter how highly one values the mode of competition.   

Some modes of being matter to us - and should matter to us - more than others. And just as we should empathize with athletes as people, we should not let the mode of competition blind us to athletes' immorality. The sports page abounds with examples of quintessential competitors who behave in [questionable](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/06/09/donut-shop-employee-said-drunk-golden-tate-stole-donuts-keys/), [unacceptable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaxico_Burress#Legal_troubles), and [evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Hernandez#Legal_issues) ways. Except for the most grievous violations, athletes, particularly highly skilled athletes, tend to escape serious consequences.^5  We are right to lament that athletes too often get away with too much, seemingly only because they are embraced by a culture that looks the other way, as long as the on-the-field results are there. It’s all to show that great competitors can be far from great people.

Whether enduring hardship or committing crime, athletes are people first. Happenings in the ""mode of being a decent human"" will always matter more than those concerning competition.   But how much overall moral weight should we place on decisions that occurred in the competitive mode, when athletes were acting not as other day-to-day people, but as athletes qua athletes?

At least some. Competition, taken seriously, carries the normative weight of other existential human pursuits. As long as one purports to be a member of the community that cares about competition, we should expect him to adopt its code. That means always trying your hardest. That means never quitting. That means doing all you can to win, except cheating. That means loyalty to your teammates. And especially, it means never taking the easy way out.

It’s easy to view those norms as stupidly earnest jock-talk - if you can’t entertain the thought of taking them seriously, then discussions about the morality of the competitive mode are not for you. I am unashamed to say that, as a competitor and a fan, I take those norms seriously. They are the foundation of competition, an institution I love.  

So when Kevin Durant elected to join the Golden State Warriors - the team of the reigning MVP, the team that had narrowly beaten him after overcoming a 3 -1series deficit, the team favored to win the next NBA title without him - he eschewed an essential competitive principle. Whatever his other reasons, as a competitor, Durant failed. As a competitor, he acted as a coward. 

The “coward” label isn’t heartless or misanthropic. That criticism presupposes that we view Durant as a neighbor or acquaintance, some regular guy.^6 Rather, fans view him and adjudicate his actions as a competitor, just as they should be expected to. We are not compelled to think of KD as another soul at the bus stop doing the best he can to make his way. He’s not that soul, and that’s not the mode of being he’s chosen to occupy. He is someone who tries to win and purports to compete, a willing player in the mode of competition.

As for Durant’s overall moral status? He’s likely a decent man.  There is little reason to think otherwise. I wish him no ill-will, and if tragedy strikes him or those he cares about, he will be in my thoughts. The weightier happenings of life supersede the concerns of the competitive mode. As a human, just as all of us, he deserves empathy and respect.

This, however, remains: it is not inconsistent to view an athlete as occupying multiple modes of being. Those modes bleed into and interact with one another, and while some modes (e.g. global citizen mode, husband mode, father mode) matter more than others, together they sum to an identity.

And as a competitor, Durant took the easy way. Yes, it’s true: he had every right to make his choice. And we, in the mode of the competitor, have every right to disdain him for it.

FOOTNOTES

(1) Yeah, I don’t forgive him.

(2) And for some of us, they’re not. If you don’t like sports or competition, you won’t get any argument from me.  Some people don’t like books either, and while I don’t really get it, I don’t have much issue with people enriching their lives with whatever it is that they do like. Maybe horses or something.

(3) Perhaps there are other modes of sports fandom, modes in which the participants are there less for winning and more for fun. The atmosphere in this mode is almost certainly less heated, and you smile at the competition while competing. There may be a few testy (even heated!) moments of competitive flare, but that’s really not the point. The point it just having a good time and, ya know, breaking a sweat with some cool people. If that’s a mode of being that people want to embrace, you have no argument from me. But it is not a mode of being that captures the raw, humanistic elements that I ascribe the competitive mode (or at least it doesn’t for me).    

(4) But if it does come to this, I might have to become a Spurs fan. (Yeah, I know the entire article is about not changing you allegiances, but if it’s do or die, you gotta look out for number one. One six-shooter and your blackest pair of cowboy boots, please). Pop just inspires confidence as a leader of men, and I’m thinking he’ll be tactically sound as well. Plus, he’s got an [ally](http://i.imgur.com/8sRR3cf.jpg) on the seas.

(5) Not that grievous behavior can’t also be ignored. Just ask some of the women at [Baylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baylor_University_sexual_assault_scandal).

(6) I get that it’s totally absurd / laughably presumptuous to say what I would have done in KD’s shoes, but I think it’s worth saying I may very well would have left. In fact, I almost definitely would have left OKC. Sorry, Oklahoma, but life’s short, and I’ve got lifestyle concerns. I do, however, like to think that I wouldn’t leave for the team that so narrowly defeated me. To me, that eschewing of competitiveness is the real sin, and a sin I would hope I could avoid. 

(7) Sports media often makes this and similar claims, in which athletes who make unpopular competitive decisions are lauded for off-the-field work. That’s probably the results of a number of factors (return to glory and behind the scenes narratives are always nice), but another may have to with how people in sports media view athletes. In sports media, athletes become a sort of occasional colleague, and in some cases acquaintances or friends. If that’s the case, it becomes more difficult to talk in terms of cowardness (lost-access, awkwardness, ruffled feathers). What’s more, fans claiming “coward” are more easily viewed as a heartless mob, even if those chants are less personal and more a defense of a cherished set of values e.g. the competitive mode.

"Most signs such as the hugs at the trade deadline and the fact that no one will pay him big for his horrible ft shooting in the playoffs indicate that the Thunder want to keep Roberson. This would be a huge mistake signing him for any more than 10 mil a year (at that smaller tag I could stomach the deal). 

In 4 years he has never developed a consistent jump shot nor free throw stroke and certainly will never average double digits in scoring. He does not cut effectively or often enough to warrant any kind of defensive attention and will be hacked before he can even go up in the playoffs rendering his defense useless anyway if you can't play him. There is absolutely no space with him and Adams or Kanter on the floor and Abrines, Mcdermott, and Oladipo are not great enough 3pt threats to give Westbrook much of a choice but to hoist up bad 3's late in games. 

There is no denying that he is a great one on one defender but the problem is that the great teams are not built solely around one superstar. He may have locked Harden down but Harden was still able to get to the line while Willaims, Gordon, and Nene went off. This would be the same deal with other teams if its GSW, he'd lock down Durant while Thompson and curry go off. For the Spurs, he might lock down Kawhi while Green, Aldridge, Gasol, and Mills go off. Against the Cavs, he can shut down LeBron but Kyrie, Korver, Love, and Smith go off. No other teams use such a one-dimensional player for 30+ minutes a night and they are built around players that can at least bring something positive to both ends of the court. He was clearly drafted and brought in to ease the defensive burden on Durant and Westbrook but with this team now, there isn't enough scoring to justify having him on the floor. 

The Thunder are already strapped in terms of cap space and with the contracts of Oladipo, Adams, and Kanter with Westbrook needing a bigger deal soon, the Thunder can't afford anymore long term albatross contracts and that is exactly what Roberson would be. I doubt anyone except the Thunder would even think of paying this guy close to 15 mil+ per year over 4-5 years. With that many bad contracts on the roster even if Westbrook does resign, the Thunder will be locked into mediocrity for the next 4-5 years at least. Thoughts?

"From reading message after message about any moves we can make in the offseason, this is what the majority consent is :

1. We cant sign anyone because we gave garbage in training max contracts so we cant do shit.

2. We cant Trade anyone but Russ because everyone sucks ass.

3. Noone likes Russell Westbrook and would ever want to play with him So he's better off leaving or just being mid tier ass for his career. 

It's incredible how much hate we've gotten. I dont remember anyone ever hating the Thunder.  

I dont believe we're that bad, but are completely fucked for an unforeseeable amount of time?

I love this team but I was obviously disappointed that Russ was the Only one who came to play for about 76 games this year, and I know this is true because I watched every one of them.


What do we do? Can Presti really pull off miracles? Or is it just going to be minor moves that sort of help the team but ultimately get us nowhere for two years? 


Are we just going to have to sit and wait for players to develop?

It's sad and again I love the team. But Russell Westbrook is a fucking legendary once in a lifetime player. 
I don't want to waste his prime sitting on our asses and waiting for children to become men. Unless they show some real promise like Grant and Abrines, I care nothing about trading them to hlep Wesbtbrook go as far as he can. 

Westbrook does NOT want to leave here, thats for sure. But I highly doubt he's gonna waste his life while we wait on people to get good when hes 33 and his knees are busted for carrying us for 5 years. 

He doesnt want that, he wants to win, because he knows he can, no more minor moves Presti, Harden gone, Kd gone, you lose Russ and its over for a decade.  It's time to make the BIG moves and give it all or nothing because that's where we're at. 

Would rather see that then another 4 years of russ desperately giving it his all while his teammates sit in the corner and watch the game like pedestrians. I understand the circumstance we were in last year, but it's a new time and we gotta reconfigure this roster right now. 
","So are we just dead in the water for years? From reading message after message about any moves we can make in the offseason, this is what the majority consent is :

1. We cant sign anyone because we gave garbage in training max contracts so we cant do shit.

2. We cant Trade anyone but Russ because everyone sucks ass.

3. Noone likes Russell Westbrook and would ever want to play with him So he's better off leaving or just being mid tier ass for his career. 

It's incredible how much hate we've gotten. I dont remember anyone ever hating the Thunder.  

I dont believe we're that bad, but are completely fucked for an unforeseeable amount of time?

I love this team but I was obviously disappointed that Russ was the Only one who came to play for about 76 games this year, and I know this is true because I watched every one of them.


What do we do? Can Presti really pull off miracles? Or is it just going to be minor moves that sort of help the team but ultimately get us nowhere for two years? 


Are we just going to have to sit and wait for players to develop?

It's sad and again I love the team. But Russell Westbrook is a fucking legendary once in a lifetime player.

"Things are often better left in context than not.

Let me start by saying this is neither an endorsement of nor an argument against Blake Griffin to OKC.

Now, look at Steve Kyler of Basketball Insiders. He's got a verified [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/stevekylerNBA?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) with 42k followers.

Seems legit, right? So legit, that Fox Sports writer Brett Pollakoff uses him as a source for [a story written in October 2016](http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/blake-griffin-is-reportedly-planning-to-re-sign-with-clippers-when-he-becomes-a-free-agent-082416) about Blake Griffin's future:

>Sources close to Griffin have been adamant that he is planning to re-sign in L.A. and that he’s not open to going anywhere. Clippers president and head coach Doc Rivers has mirrored that, saying he believes Griffin retires as a Clipper. …

>Sources close to the situation say win or lose, Rivers is not open to trade talks on Griffin or Paul and that he’s not worried about either walking away in July.

That's the selective portions of Kyler's story quoted by Pollakoff in Fox Sports. Kyler published it on August 23, 2016.

Kyler published [this article](http://www.basketballinsiders.com/nba-pm-could-the-clippers-move-blake-griffin/) just two weeks prior, with some juicy nuggets:

>However, with Westbrook on-board, there is a new rumor in Oklahoma City to watch and that is the Thunder’s potential pursuit of L.A. Clippers forward Blake Griffin.

>On the surface it seems foolish and somewhat unlikely to believe that Griffin lands in Oklahoma City anytime soon. However, there are many in the NBA that believe if the Clippers cannot get over the top this season, there will be big changes made to ensure the Clippers do not lose star guard Chris Paul to free agency next summer.

Oh really? You don't say.

Now Blake Griffin is injured -- again -- sitting on the bench in the playoffs, this year ironically watching Chris Paul try to carry the team.

Enough with Kyler and a story written prior to the season. 

Type in ""Blake Griffin contract"" on Twitter. The second result is a [story by Heavy.com](http://heavy.com/news/2017/04/blake-griffin-contract-length-extension-expire-yearly-salary/) (really? Heavy.com?) saying the following:

>According to Sportrac, though, Blake Griffin’s salary started at $16 million when he signed the extension and has increased every year. He made $17 million in 2014, $18 million in 2015, $20 million in 2016, and will make $21 million in 2017. This adds up to about $95 million.

>So what’s going to happen when Blake Griffin’s contract expires? At the moment, his intention seems to be to resign with the Clippers. **Fox Sports reported last summer that Griffin is not open to going anywhere else.**

The same Fox Sports story referenced above is where Pollakoff is quoting Kyler. 

My point is this, as much as the Clippers would love to keep Blake, they are sold on signing Chris Paul. The Thunder are in a similar boat trying to sign Russell Westbrook to a long-term deal. 

The possibility of Blake coming to play in OKC is still low, but I think the door is somewhat creaked open now, ever-so slightly. Blake is no longer the star in LA. In fact, one could put him behind both CP3 and DeAndre Jordan. 

Whatever Blake Griffin's destination might be this offseason, I think his value has dropped tremendously in terms of signing a big contract. In his past three seasons, he played 67, 35 and 61 games, mostly missing out due to injury. 

A change of scenery might, in a basketball sense, might be what he needs. Blake's biggest advantage is being a free agent. He can talk to anyone and listen to every offer a team has. Whether it's money, a championship, a new challenge -- he is in the driver seat. 

I just doubt the LA Clippers fit where his future lies, and I'm sure OKC is in the back of his mind, even if he isn't thinking about playing with the MVP. Perhaps he chases the biggest check. Perhaps he wants to live in Miami. There's no telling, but the man has options, and I'm sure for him OKC is one of them.","Blake Griffin (hear me out) Things are often better left in context than not.

**Team Needs**

Going into the offseason, we have 3 main holes:

-Shooting
-Playmaking/ Shot Creation
-Consistent bench scorer

I was thinking about a series of trades last night that I decided to flesh out, so let's look at our cap situation.

According to [hoopshype](http://hoopshype.com/salaries/oklahoma_city_thunder/), we have about 110 million tied up in cap space. I'm not sure if this is including our cap holds on Roberson and Taj, but based on my quick math it isn't. Our cap holds on Robes and Taj are 3 million and 14 million respectively. According to this [Woj report](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2702307-nba-salary-cap-tax-level-projections-revealed-for-2017-18-season) I found on B/R, the cap is set to be 101-103 million, and the luxury tax at around 120. For the sake of this analysis, I'm going to use a cap figure of 102.

**TRADE #1**

Now, this trade has 2 objectives:, first of all, we desperately need a high volume outside shooter who can get us buckets, who can ideally create their own shot. One person who fits this role ideally, is Zach LaVine from Minnesota. Zach was a deadeye shooter this year (he blessed my fantasy team with 3s!) who shoots over 40%, can catch and shoot, as well as create his own shot if neccessary. Zach also got a lot of run at  PG his rookie year. While at the end of the day, he's not a PG, he *can* run PG for stretches, which means that between him, Russ, and Oladipo, we could potentially get by without a real backup PG. However, I'll still be looking for one later in this piece.

OKC RECIEVES: Zach LaVine, Gorgui Dieng, Brandon Rush, Pick #6 in the 2017 draft

MIN RECIEVES: Steven Adams, Alex Abrines, Pick #21 in the 2017 draft

Thibs in Minny is well known for his defence first mentality. Additionally, KAT has actually been one of the worst defenders this season, and might not be able to play C against top C's for a while. Given all the talk of trading LaVine / other players for Jimmy Butler, I don't think the Wolves would be too sad to give him up for a good return. To make this work, we may not recieve Dieng as I feel like Minnesota is giving up somewhat more than us. Presti is a magician, but I don't see this as a dealbreaker even if we do not get Dieng. Brandon Rush is just cap filler to make the trade work, I doubt Minnesota cares.

LaVine + Dieng earn 17$ mil next season, and we are trading away $31 from Adams + Abrines. This brings our cap number from 110 + holds to 96 + holds.

**TRADE #2**

While the trade for Zach mitigates our lack of a backup PG, I'm not sure if there is anyone we want to take with #6. We COULD use it to draft a backup like De'Aaron Fox, but given the current timeline of the team, and the fact that no PG is likely to develop into a star behind Russ, I believe the best way to get a backup PG would be to trade it. Now, who's the perfect guard heavy trade partner? The Lakers!

The Lakers currently have too many young guards on their roster, and Clarkson has filled the 6th man role this season. For those of you that don't know, the Lakers have around a 50/50 (it might be 40/60) chance of losing their pick to the Sixers. If they keep it, they are most likely going to get a guard (most likely Lonzo Ball, if they get lucky), or are not going to keep their pick. If they get Lonzo, it's a logjam they need to clear. If they don't have a pick, that would be bad as they probably want another young combo forward like Josh Jackson who can compliment Ingram.

OKC RECIEVES: Jordan Clarkson

LAL RECIEVES: Kyle Singler, Semaj Christon, Brandon Rush, Pick #6 in the 2017 NBA draft

This pretty much comes down to, *do the Lakers think Jordan Clarkson is better than one of the many options the Lakers have at pick #6?* To me, while Clarkson is pretty good, the answer is definitely no. Lakers would be happy to make this trade if they were offered it. Clarkson is earning $12 million per season, but this trade would bring us over the tax. To make it work, we'd have to give them Singler, Christon, and Rush along with the pick. The Lakers can afford the cap hit of $8 million as they aren't looking to sign an FA this summer. This brings us to $104 million + holds.

**TRADE #3**
This one isn't strictly neccessary, but I've seen people talk about it. We need an iso scorer, and who's unhappy in NYC? 

Melo.

Since Melo is getting divorced, and LaLa is what held him in NYC. If he cares about winning he might want to come here. It's still a longshot but hey, isn't this all?

OKC RECIEVES: Carmelo Anthony

NYK RECIEVES: Enes Kanter, Nick Collison, Josh Huestis, OKC 2019 2nd round pick

If Melo tells the front office he wants OKC, then this can happen. No 2 ways around it. It fills a need for us, but it comes down to what Melo wants. This would bring us to $108 million + holds.

**FINAL ROSTER**

After all of this, we're around 108 million. Roberson is a team guy, and we need to stay under the luxury tax ideally, so hopefully he'll accept something like $44/4 and keep our bill at around $118-119 million, out of the tax. Ideally that would also leave us with enough space to sign Dakari to a minimum, for the backup C role. Unfortunately, this also means that we won't be resigning Taj.

However, the man *has* made a career out of exactly that, and I'm confident he will do it again this summer. These trades bring us a much improved lineup, which is in my opinion, good enough to be a title contender.

"(S&T) Trade: Kanter, Roberson & Singler for Eric Bledsoe


**The Logistics/Summary**



Most important thing to note is the Suns (as of now have the 2nd best odds at the #1 pick and are situated at #2) will likely land Fultz/Ball in the draft and *if they do* they'll have a tough choice to make... now imo dumping Knight would be the first choice it would be exactly that, a dump. He doesn't have much value due to him having *3 more years* @ over 14/year. The $ isn't crazy in fact it's 29th for PG in the league but if I'm moving on from anyone in that soon to be crowded back-court it's Knight. 



PHX could just take Josh Jackson but that gives them Jackson/Warren/Chriss/Bender/Dudley (still has 2 more years @ 10mil each) and Derrick Jones all in that 6'7-6'10 forward role so there's a glut there too. 



For the rest of this thought experiment lets assume PHX either get's the #1 pick (Fultz) or takes Ball @ 2/3.



So the backcourt come draft day will look be (again barring getting Fultz/Ball) 
  

*PG: Fultz-Ball/Bledsoe/Ulis

*SG: Booker/Knight/Barbosa



Maybe they trade down but NBA teams don't usually do that unless you're KAAAAAAAHHHHHHNNNNN. So lets disregard that possibility in this case.



Clearly Bledsoe is the best player in this deal. He's a two way threat and borderline all star but, and this is no small thing, he got thrown into the Phantom Zone for the franchises tank job. Sure Bled seems like a willing participant but the guy strikes me as a real competitor and hasn't been on a contender. He may be ready to go after a real chance at a the playoffs and playing with a superstar in Russ. IIRC they are good friends off court too?... Plus he's third fiddle on a Fultz/Booker team likely not re-signing in 2 years and his age puts him a few years ahead of the Suns Schedule...



What I mean by the Suns Schedule is this team is going to be built around Devin. Devin and in this case Fultz. These guys are babies in NBA years and it's best to have the majority of the core peaking around the same time. In Phoenix's case I'd aim for some improvement next year, maybe playoffs and try to win my Chip in 3-4 years with Book, Fultz, Chriss, Bender, Warren all between 24-28. There's no need to ""win now"". Be patient and in a few years the Spurs will be sans Parker, Ginobili & Aldridge may be a shell & the Warriors may have broken up. Point is to build around your 2-3 studs and get the team peaking together. Bledsoe will be over 30 in two years and a free agent looking to get one last big contract. 



**PROS FOR THE SUNS**



**Phoenix has cap flexibility**



Next season PHX has less than 70 million on the books without having to really re-sign anyone. 
The Core is basically locked in monetarily. Chriss and Bender have 4 more years. Booker, Ulis, Knight 3 and Warren 2. So when Booker is ready for that max the combined 22+ million of Chandler and Dudley will be coming off the books (2 years from now). 
So let's take Bledsoe out and add Kanter and Roberson for lets say 15 million a year... 
That gives you an additional 17 million (basically swapping Bleds $ for Robes and adding Kanters 17/year)
Now we're at 87 million, add the draft pick salaries and roster fill and we'll call it about 95-100 million. Still comfortably below the limit. Even with Singler tacked on they don't cross 100 million. Basically money isn't an issue even adding 2 decent contracts.



Now I know you're thinking *""the Suns ownership is fucking cheap""*. That's definitely true but in this scenario they could always salary dump Dudley, Len, Chandler and/or Barbosa.  



**Phoenix adds an elite wing defender.**



Roberson worked best between Russ and KD obviously. He took the pressure off their scoring load defensively by guarding the opponents best player. You can afford his offensive issues when he's surrounded by scoring talent. In this case Russ/KD becomes Fultz/Ball, Knight, Booker & Warren. The Suns *need* a wing stopper. Now wait the Suns have a great defensive guear already (Bledsoe) as the league becomes more and more positionless the just over 6 foot Bledsoe just isn't going to have the impact that the 6'9 stretch Armstrong like Roberson. Especially against the Kawhi, Harden, Giannis, Klay, Hayward, Butler, Lebron types.  



**Phoenix adds post scoring, an elite 6th man and rebounding**



I like Chriss and Bender but neither are traditional post scorers, at least not yet. Alex Len is fine but I've seen enough to believe he's a league average center. He's missed some time and is an expiring next year. ""But Kanter couldn't even play in the playoffs"". It's true but almost any traditional Center gets run off the floor vs Houston. Len included. It's just a bad match up but let's not let that cloud the fact that Kanter destroyed second units consistently putting up nights of 15/10 in 20 or so minutes. It wasn't as if we had a real back up PG to get him the ball in good spots either. (SMH backwards James). Again to put this in context Kanter doesn't need to be anything more than a 6th or 7th man. He's been willing to play that role. He's a fantastic teammate and would bring the bench scoring and rebounding punch the Suns lack. A scoring big that demands doubles never hurt a rookie PG either. Worst case scenario he's a free agent in 2019 so you can let him walk and have more than enough $ for your young guys extensions or a big free agent. Really worst case it's 2 years of Bledsoe for 3-5 years of Roberson at the same $ and 2 years of Kanter. 



**Hows the team look now?** 



Roberson takes the tough assignments on one end. Fultz/Ball run the show. Booker is the star. Knight, Warren, Kanter is more than enough scoring off the bench. This means last years lotto picks Chriss & Bender can develop without too much pressure. They just need to play within themselves, catch lobs, set picks and you can bring them along slowly. You have Dudley still for specific instances where you need a sniper and Chandler is your bench leader ala Nick Collison. 



*PG: Fultz-Ball/Ulis

*SG: Booker/Knight

*SF: Roberson/Warren/Dudley

*PF: Chriss/Bender/Jones

*C: Len/Kanter/Chandler



Everybody is locked in for multiple years. It's a super young team that can grow together and be a contender in 2-4 years. 




**PROS:**



**Additional Ballhandler & Playmaker**



The disparity of Russ on and off the court isn't just due to how good he is. OKC has D League backups at PG (Semaj Criston/Norris Cole) This is what really fucked the Thunder in the playoffs. The issue is deeper even than that. The entire team other than Oladipo has literally zero play making ability. Abrines and McBuckets are one way players. More specifically all they can do is catch and shoot. Neither are creating for others. Sabonis & Taj keep the ball moving but they aren't breaking down defenses either. Adams is a solid passer but doesn't draw doubles even and Kanter... Well he doesn't like to pass much. We saw in the playoffs that Oladipo just isn't a natural PG. We hoped he'd be able to stagger with Russ and keep us afloat but he was chucking and making terrible decisions. It's unfair to expect him to be the 2nd best player, second scorer or secondary ball handler on a championship caliber team. But as a third guard and 3rd/4th scoring option he can excel. With Bledsoe on the team Dipo moves to 6th man and the trio of Russ/Bled/Dipo is enough to stagger and not have much issues running the second team. If you really are worried about it then add a vet pg with the MLE (a Dj Augustine/Darren Collison type).  



**The trade removes 2 one way players from an already unbalanced roster.**



The other major issue with the Thunder was a litany of one way players. Roberson and Kanter *in a vacuum* are really solid players who are some of the best in the league at the specific thing they do (wing d for Roberson and Offensive Boards, low post scoring for Kanter). On OKC with the already limited Abrines/McDermott, lack of a second team ball handler, below average spacing and Adams already locked in at Center, well...Roberson and Kanter are simply not great fits. I do believe as I've already stated that on Phoenix they can be maximized.  You see OKC doesn't have a second unit PG to run any offense let alone P&R's with Enes. It's really exaggerated by having crap shooters/spacing around him too. I really like Kanter and think he could shine in the right situation (think Nurkic with the Portland guards vs Nurkic with Mudiay/Nelson and the offense going through the Joker, night and day right?)



**Hows the team look now?**



Bledsoe and Jerami Grant basically split Robersons duties. A trio of Russ Bledsoe and Oladipo closing out games is a blitzkrieg of intensity and both Bledsoe and Dipo alleviate Russ's defensive duties. Oladipo goes back to his more natural role of 6th man. Basically Russ can camp on the opponents worst shooter/scorer and focus on getting them boards. The bench is hurt by not having Enes but staggering the aforementioned trio will balance that missing scoring out for the most part. Basically as long as Bledsoe is healthy he can be 80% Roberson on defense and bring what Kanter did on offense all while being a 2 way player. This means OKC will need players to step up and here's where the trade may look like a step back but it's more one step back 2 steps forward in my eyes. Grant and Sabonis play a lot more at the 4 sure but both are solid defenders and can play vs nearly any team. It also provides more spacing (especially if McBuckets plays some 4). Honestly backup C is imo the least important bench spot to fill especially an old school one. Adams/Taj/Sabonis/Grant and a uber cheap vet or our 1st rounder is a good enough rotation of bigs. Meanwhile we have no more black holes on offense (dump it to Kanter everyone stand around and Roberson being Roberson). The salaries off add up to about 100 million so Taj could come back and with some finagling OKC could avoid the luxury tax. 



One issue could be depth. Depth was a huge problem and really cost OKC but here's my justification... the entire team is super young so it's safe to assume Abrines, Sabonis, Grant, Adams, McDermott, Oladipo (all under 25) will improve with hopefully one or two making a real leap. Add in one or two cheap vets and a your first round pick and you've got a versatile uber young team. 



**How's the roster looks now...**



*PG: Westbrook

*SG: Bledsoe/Oladipo

*SF: McDermott/Abrines

*PF: Taj/Sabonis/Grant

*C: Adams

*Add in the 21st pick & one or two cheap vets



**In Conclusion** 



Like this past year the OKC roster post trade isn't a contender but it isn't realistic to think with the Thunder with their cap situation as it stands and all the youth can get there without a ton of internal development. That's Presti's philosophy, **internal development**. In my opinion it would be much easier to build with a base of Russ/Bledsoe/Adams/Oladipo and young cheap contracts. Locking in Roberson and having Kanter's money sets our ceiling and that's it. That's the team. I just don't know if that team can contend. With less one way players, another ball-handler and a mentally similar guy to Westbrook the team is more malleable if you do need to move some pieces and better suited for today's pace and space position-less NBA.



*Quick note: I am not certain this trade is possible but the general idea is the priciple here. PHX or OKC could adds role players, salary filler or picks on either side to make it work. Maybe I'm nuts... Maybe I'm too reactionary but I believe this is a win/win for both teams. As a die hard Thunder fan I admitedly am sick of one way players. 



*Last note: I get it OKC fans want Hayward but that seems unlikely. Maybe Blake wants to come home but the team locked into Robes & Kanter makes that near impossible. Some PHX fans want a superstar but it isn't like PHX is a free agent destination historically and unless you KNOW Butler/George whoever will re-sign it isn't worth what it would take (likely this years #1 and pieces). Let me know what you think and feel free to toss around other trades or ideas on how to proceed going forward for both franchises.

Now we're at 87 million, add the draft pick salaries and roster fill and we'll call it about 95-100 million. Still comfortably below the limit. Even with Singler tacked on they don't cross 100 million. Basically money isn't an issue even adding 2 decent contracts.



Now I know you're thinking *""the Suns ownership is fucking cheap""*. That's definitely true but in this scenario they could always salary dump Dudley, Len, Chandler and/or Barbosa.  



**Phoenix adds an elite wing defender.**



Roberson worked best between Russ and KD obviously. He took the pressure off their scoring load defensively by guarding the opponents best player. You can afford his offensive issues when he's surrounded by scoring talent. In this case Russ/KD becomes Fultz/Ball, Knight, Booker & Warren. The Suns *need* a wing stopper. Now wait the Suns have a great defensive guear already (Bledsoe) as the league becomes more and more positionless the just over 6 foot Bledsoe just isn't going to have the impact that the 6'9 stretch Armstrong like Roberson. Especially against the Kawhi, Harden, Giannis, Klay, Hayward, Butler, Lebron types.  



**Phoenix adds post scoring, an elite 6th man and rebounding**



I like Chriss and Bender but neither are traditional post scorers, at least not yet. Alex Len is fine but I've seen enough to believe he's a league average center. He's missed some time and is an expiring next year. ""But Kanter couldn't even play in the playoffs"". It's true but almost any traditional Center gets run off the floor vs Houston. Len included. It's just a bad match up but let's not let that cloud the fact that Kanter destroyed second units consistently putting up nights of 15/10 in 20 or so minutes. It wasn't as if we had a real back up PG to get him the ball in good spots either. (SMH backwards James). Again to put this in context Kanter doesn't need to be anything more than a 6th or 7th man. He's been willing to play that role. He's a fantastic teammate and would bring the bench scoring and rebounding punch the Suns lack. A scoring big that demands doubles never hurt a rookie PG either. Worst case scenario he's a free agent in 2019 so you can let him walk and have more than enough $ for your young guys extensions or a big free agent. Really worst case it's 2 years of Bledsoe for 3-5 years of Roberson at the same $ and 2 years of Kanter. 



**Hows the team look now?** 



Roberson takes the tough assignments on one end. Fultz/Ball run the show. Booker is the star. Knight, Warren, Kanter is more than enough scoring off the bench. This means last years lotto picks Chriss & Bender can develop without too much pressure. They just need to play within themselves, catch lobs, set picks and you can bring them along slowly. You have Dudley still for specific instances where you need a sniper and Chandler is your bench leader ala Nick Collison. 



*PG: Fultz-Ball/Ulis

*SG: Booker/Knight

*SF: Roberson/Warren/Dudley

*PF: Chriss/Bender/Jones

*C: Len/Kanter/Chandler



Everybody is locked in for multiple years. It's a super young team that can grow together and be a contender in 2-4 years. 




**PROS:**



**Additional Ballhandler & Playmaker**



The disparity of Russ on and off the court isn't just due to how good he is. OKC has D League backups at PG (Semaj Criston/Norris Cole) This is what really fucked the Thunder in the playoffs. The issue is deeper even than that. The entire team other than Oladipo has literally zero play making ability. Abrines and McBuckets are one way players. More specifically all they can do is catch and shoot. Neither are creating for others. Sabonis & Taj keep the ball moving but they aren't breaking down defenses either. Adams is a solid passer but doesn't draw doubles even and Kanter... Well he doesn't like to pass much. We saw in the playoffs that Oladipo just isn't a natural PG. We hoped he'd be able to stagger with Russ and keep us afloat but he was chucking and making terrible decisions. It's unfair to expect him to be the 2nd best player, second scorer or secondary ball handler on a championship caliber team. But as a third guard and 3rd/4th scoring option he can excel. With Bledsoe on the team Dipo moves to 6th man and the trio of Russ/Bled/Dipo is enough to stagger and not have much issues running the second team. If you really are worried about it then add a vet pg with the MLE (a Dj Augustine/Darren Collison type).  



**The trade removes 2 one way players from an already unbalanced roster.**



The other major issue with the Thunder was a litany of one way players. Roberson and Kanter *in a vacuum* are really solid players who are some of the best in the league at the specific thing they do (wing d for Roberson and Offensive Boards, low post scoring for Kanter). On OKC with the already limited Abrines/McDermott, lack of a second team ball handler, below average spacing and Adams already locked in at Center, well...Roberson and Kanter are simply not great fits. I do believe as I've already stated that on Phoenix they can be maximized.  You see OKC doesn't have a second unit PG to run any offense let alone P&R's with Enes. It's really exaggerated by having crap shooters/spacing around him too. I really like Kanter and think he could shine in the right situation (think Nurkic with the Portland guards vs Nurkic with Mudiay/Nelson and the offense going through the Joker, night and day right?)



**Hows the team look now?**



Bledsoe and Jerami Grant basically split Robersons duties. A trio of Russ Bledsoe and Oladipo closing out games is a blitzkrieg of intensity and both Bledsoe and Dipo alleviate Russ's defensive duties. Oladipo goes back to his more natural role of 6th man. Basically Russ can camp on the opponents worst shooter/scorer and focus on getting them boards. The bench is hurt by not having Enes but staggering the aforementioned trio will balance that missing scoring out for the most part. Basically as long as Bledsoe is healthy he can be 80% Roberson on defense and bring what Kanter did on offense all while being a 2 way player. This means OKC will need players to step up and here's where the trade may look like a step back but it's more one step back 2 steps forward in my eyes. Grant and Sabonis play a lot more at the 4 sure but both are solid defenders and can play vs nearly any team. It also provides more spacing (especially if McBuckets plays some 4). Honestly backup C is imo the least important bench spot to fill especially an old school one. Adams/Taj/Sabonis/Grant and a uber cheap vet or our 1st rounder is a good enough rotation of bigs. Meanwhile we have no more black holes on offense (dump it to Kanter everyone stand around and Roberson being Roberson). The salaries off add up to about 100 million so Taj could come back and with some finagling OKC could avoid the luxury tax. 



One issue could be depth. Depth was a huge problem and really cost OKC but here's my justification... the entire team is super young so it's safe to assume Abrines, Sabonis, Grant, Adams, McDermott, Oladipo (all under 25) will improve with hopefully one or two making a real leap. Add in one or two cheap vets and a your first round pick and you've got a versatile uber young team. 



**How's the roster looks now...**



*PG: Westbrook

*SG: Bledsoe/Oladipo

*SF: McDermott/Abrines

*PF: Taj/Sabonis/Grant

*C: Adams

*Add in the 21st pick & one or two cheap vets



**In Conclusion** 



Like this past year the OKC roster post trade isn't a contender but it isn't realistic to think with the Thunder with their cap situation as it stands and all the youth can get there without a ton of internal development. That's Presti's philosophy, **internal development**. In my opinion it would be much easier to build with a base of Russ/Bledsoe/Adams/Oladipo and young cheap contracts. Locking in Roberson and having Kanter's money sets our ceiling and that's it. That's the team. I just don't know if that team can contend. With less one way players, another ball-handler and a mentally similar guy to Westbrook the team is more malleable if you do need to move some pieces and better suited for today's pace and space position-less NBA.



*Quick note: I am not certain this trade is possible but the general idea is the priciple here. PHX or OKC could adds role players, salary filler or picks on either side to make it work. Maybe I'm nuts... Maybe I'm too reactionary but I believe this is a win/win for both teams. As a die hard Thunder fan I admitedly am sick of one way players. 



*Last note: I get it OKC fans want Hayward but that seems unlikely. Maybe Blake wants to come home but the team locked into Robes & Kanter makes that near impossible. Some PHX fans want a superstar but it isn't like PHX is a free agent destination historically and unless you KNOW Butler/George whoever will re-sign it isn't worth what it would take (likely this years #1 and pieces). Let me know what you think and feel free to toss around other trades or ideas on how to proceed going forward for both franchises. 


Cheers fellow fanatics!

"So I know the cap space ain't looking too pretty right now but with all this talk of Hayward and griffin I thought that there were a few targets we could go after this offseason that won't destroy our cap. 
Keep in mind this is assuming Singler's decision to retire from basketball to pursue his passions of origami and watching paint dry. 
1. Greg Monroe-> URFA he's currently coming off the bench in Milwaukee and with the development of thon maker and his history of butting heads with Kidd I don't expect him to be too keen on staying there. The man can score and while his defense isn't stellar he's less of a liability than kanter. 

2. Dewayne Dedmon -> URFA 
I may be biased because I watched him play at USC   in undergrad. But He is an absolute savage on defense. He's extremely athletic and pulls down boards. He's currently making less than 3 million this year for the spurs and with their cap space limitations I doubt they resign him. 

3. Patty mills-> the ultimate back up point guard. Explosive scoring of the bench great three point shooter and can move the ball around. However I don't think the spurs are going to want to part with him 😢

4. Tyler Ennis-> URFA another option for back up PG he can score, shoot treys, and move the ball. The lakers are extremely PG heavy right now and I just don't see them resigning him. He went on a tear during the tank and produces when given the opportunity 

5. Nikola mirotic-> URFA he saw a decline in 3pt % this season but I blame that on the disfunction of the bulls locker room and Freddy-hoi. We can use anyone who can shoot from beyond the arc at this point and he may be persuaded to join dougy and taj in OKC. He isn't a good ISO defender. 
But he isn't going to kill us either. It doesn't hurt that he's 6'10 either. 

Others 
Thomas Robinson-> urfa he can play D and get boards. With all the lakers up and coming big men I don't see them trying to resign him and I think we could get him on a cheap contract. 

Jamychal Green-> RFA the grizz are probably going to try to resign him otherwise he'd be way up on my list. He's an extremely mobile defender can pull down boards great offensive rebounder  and shoot the three >38% and even make free throws >80% . He'd be a great fit at the 4 and let robes move to the 3. I'm hoping the parson and Conley contracts will limit what Memphis can offer him but I'd love to see him on the Thunder 

I'd love to throw in James Johnson but he seems content on staying in Miami but I believe he'd be a perfect fit for the Thunder. Especially for team chemistry and as an enforcer. He's a black belt, alpha af.

"We all know his glaring weakness, but I think he could make a great starting PF (at least for the remainder of his contract) for a number of reasons. 1. we already have him on a contract, that'll save us cap space by not having to resign Taj or another vet. 2. He's a great outside shooter. If we could convert him into more of a stretch 4 I think he could be even more effective on offense. 1-4 P&R could be really dangerous, especially considering how few teams have a defensive 4 that can switch on to RW. 3.

"Look who we have: Russell Westbrook, who you all already know is great and why. Look who else we have though, Steven Adams? Andre Roberson? Gibson? Oladipo? Kanter? Sabonis? Abrines? All young and brilliant players who have so much more room to develop. We've seen what Abrines can do, beyond the arc, in the paint, and even defensively. Sabonis can hit a few 3-pointers here and there. 

I have a few issues though: Oladipo kind of seems like a slightly worse Westbrook. Don't get me wrong, I love Oladipo, and I also LOVE Kanter. I'd love for them to stay because they feel like home to us now. From a business standpoint? I think we should trade one, or both of them for Blake Griffin. We don't NEED Oladipo or Kanter, but it would be sad to see either one go. Especially considering the bromance between Kanter and Adams.

Here's the crazy thing...

I think KD might be pulling a Lebron. I genuinely think there's a possibility he might have left OKC to win a ring or two, and then he'll come back and help us win one here. I mean, no one thought Lebron would leave Cleveland for Miami, because Cleveland was his home. Cleveland gave him everything (aside from rings) that he had up until that point. It seemed just too crazy that he'd leave. As an OKC thunder fan, AND an OKC resident, I can tell you, it seemed so unlikely KD would leave OKC, but he did. It hurt, too. But I think he'll come back, because he did love OKC, and I know he'd love to make OKC into a dynasty.

James Harden free agency is coming up, too. He and Westbrook are good friends. He still, to this day, thinks about how great OKC could've been if he would've stayed. But now, with his new set of skill and development, I think he knows he could come back to OKC and be the best player aside from Russ, and they could achieve a lot. We could get rid of Christon, and maybe Oladipo to make room for Harden.

"OKC's biggest problem is the lack of a reliable backup PG/secondary ballhandler. A 2-way wing would solve a lot of issues, but the fundamental flaw is that the team falls apart whenever Westbrook hits the bench. A wing isn't going to solve that problem. A trustworthy backup will. 

Here are the various options I see for our backup PG spot next season:

#1) **Stick with Christon and/or Norris Cole**

The least popular option. I think we'd be insane to stick with Norris Cole as the backup. Christon showed defensive promise as a rookie, but was obviously not an NBA-caliber backup. If he takes a leap from his rookie to sophomore season, he *might* be the guy. I would be far more comfortable with Christon as the third PG, however. 

#2) **Sign a backup PG in free agency**

[Here's the list of free agent PGs this summer](http://www.spotrac.com/nba/free-agents/point-guard/).

Names that stand out to me:

* **Shaun Livingston**
* **Darren Collison**
* **Patty Mills**
* **Ty Lawson**
* **Deron Williams**

Remember, however, that we don't have significant cap space this summer, so we're looking at signing a guy for the mid-level exception (barring significant trades). I expect most if not all of those guys will be out of our price range. 

#3) **Trade for a backup PG**

I think this is one of the two most likely options. Glancing at [ESPN's list of current NBA point guards](http://www.espn.com/nba/players/_/position/pg), here are some names that stand out to me:

* **Jordan Clarkson**
* **Dante Exum**
* **Jerian Grant**
* **Tyus Jones**
* **Emmanuel Mudiay**

Clarkson, the only veteran on the list, is signed through 2020 and will make $11.5M this fall--a really nice contract under the new cap. He's more of a shooting guard than a point guard, but I think he could be a solid sixth man for this team (and our ideal backup PG should be able to play off-ball next to Westbrook in certain lineups). If the Lakers keep their pick and draft Fultz or Ball, they will have a logjam at PG and Clarkson could be available. That said, I do not know that we have the assets to land him...unless Magic is a big fan of Enes Kanter. A Kanter-for-Clarkson trade could be great for OKC, and the Lakers are short on reliable centers. 

The other four are all on rookie contracts (i.e., the sort of guys Presti usually targets in trades). Jones is known to be available. I don't think Grant is the answer, but I'm guessing Chicago would trade him. Mudiay may have fallen out of favor in Denver (could be wrong, as I don't follow the Nuggets closely). Exum is my favorite of the bunch, but he may have shown enough this season that Utah won't let him go. 

One last thought: part of the rationale I've read for the Payne trade is that Presti and company concluded that Payne wasn't going to develop playing behind Westbrook. If Presti concludes that *no* raw, young backup will develop behind Westbrook, that could change the calculus considerably. 

#4) **Draft a backup PG** 

This seems on first glance like the most likely option, but I don't think it makes sense at our current draft position. We have the 21st pick. Barring a trade up, we aren't going to land one of the elite prospects. There is a big gap between the 5 elite PG prospects and the next tier, and I am reasonably certain that there will be significantly better players at other positions on the board at #21. 

Of the five elite guys, the only one who could realistically drop far enough that we could trade up to land him would be **Frank Ntilikina**. I do not think that is a likely outcome. 

However, there is a solid crop of lesser regarded backup PGs in this draft who we could land by trading back to pick up an additional pick (or player). Most of these guys should be available in the second round, and certainly in the late first:

* **Jawun Evans**
* **Monte Morris**
* **Frank Mason III**
* **Kobi Simmons**
* **PJ Dozier** 
* **Marcus Keene** 

Evans is the only one of those guys who has a decent shot at going in the first round. He's a sophomore PG from Oklahoma State with tremendous talent. He'd go much higher if he weren't undersized. 

Morris and Mason are the two guys who intrigue me the most. Both are seniors from the Big XII. Mason just swept every National Player of the Year award, while Morris has been one of the nation's best passers for four straight years. As older prospects, they could be ready to make an immediate impact a la Norman Powell and Malcolm Brogdon. 

Simmons is a one-and-done freshman. Dozier is a sophomore with positional versatility and a huge wingspan. Marcus Keene is 5'9, but he led the nation in scoring. 

#Bonus: **Sign a UDFA PG**

I think there's a very good chance that as many as 5 of the draft options I listed above could go undrafted. If that happens, OKC could sign them without having to trade for or buy a second round pick. 

# Conclusion

The obvious danger in any of the draft options is that we'd be relying on a rookie to solve the team's biggest problem, which is always a dicey proposition. If we do draft a PG, I expect one of two things will happen: either Presti will keep Christon (signaling that the franchise has faith he is an NBA-caliber backup), or Presti will dump Christon and sign/trade for a veteran backup. 

**My guess**: we'll draft a wing, trade for a veteran backup, and keep Christon. 

**My dream scenario**: we'll draft a wing, trade for a veteran backup OR keep Christon, and sign a UDFA PG (Mason?) who makes the roster and locks down the primary backup spot. 

#Thoughts? 

**EDIT:** Credit to /u/pmckz for pointing out that I linked to the 2018 free agent list. I've updated the post. The 2017 crop is much better for us than the 2018 crop. ","[OC] Backup PG plan moving forward OKC's biggest problem is the lack of a reliable backup PG/secondary ballhandler. A 2-way wing would solve a lot of issues, but the fundamental flaw is that the team falls apart whenever Westbrook hits the bench. A wing isn't going to solve that problem. A trustworthy backup will. 

Here are the various options I see for our backup PG spot next season:

#1) **Stick with Christon and/or Norris Cole**

The least popular option. I think we'd be insane to stick with Norris Cole as the backup. Christon showed defensive promise as a rookie, but was obviously not an NBA-caliber backup. If he takes a leap from his rookie to sophomore season, he *might* be the guy. I would be far more comfortable with Christon as the third PG, however. 

#2) **Sign a backup PG in free agency**

[Here's the list of free agent PGs this summer](http://www.spotrac.com/nba/free-agents/point-guard/).

Names that stand out to me:

* **Shaun Livingston**
* **Darren Collison**
* **Patty Mills**
* **Ty Lawson**
* **Deron Williams**

Remember, however, that we don't have significant cap space this summer, so we're looking at signing a guy for the mid-level exception (barring significant trades). I expect most if not all of those guys will be out of our price range. 

#3) **Trade for a backup PG**

I think this is one of the two most likely options. Glancing at [ESPN's list of current NBA point guards](http://www.espn.com/nba/players/_/position/pg), here are some names that stand out to me:

* **Jordan Clarkson**
* **Dante Exum**
* **Jerian Grant**
* **Tyus Jones**
* **Emmanuel Mudiay**

Clarkson, the only veteran on the list, is signed through 2020 and will make $11.5M this fall--a really nice contract under the new cap. He's more of a shooting guard than a point guard, but I think he could be a solid sixth man for this team (and our ideal backup PG should be able to play off-ball next to Westbrook in certain lineups). If the Lakers keep their pick and draft Fultz or Ball, they will have a logjam at PG and Clarkson could be available. That said, I do not know that we have the assets to land him...unless Magic is a big fan of Enes Kanter. A Kanter-for-Clarkson trade could be great for OKC, and the Lakers are short on reliable centers. 

The other four are all on rookie contracts (i.e., the sort of guys Presti usually targets in trades). Jones is known to be available. I don't think Grant is the answer, but I'm guessing Chicago would trade him. Mudiay may have fallen out of favor in Denver (could be wrong, as I don't follow the Nuggets closely). Exum is my favorite of the bunch, but he may have shown enough this season that Utah won't let him go. 

One last thought: part of the rationale I've read for the Payne trade is that Presti and company concluded that Payne wasn't going to develop playing behind Westbrook. If Presti concludes that *no* raw, young backup will develop behind Westbrook, that could change the calculus considerably. 

#4) **Draft a backup PG** 

This seems on first glance like the most likely option, but I don't think it makes sense at our current draft position. We have the 21st pick. Barring a trade up, we aren't going to land one of the elite prospects. There is a big gap between the 5 elite PG prospects and the next tier, and I am reasonably certain that there will be significantly better players at other positions on the board at #21. 

Of the five elite guys, the only one who could realistically drop far enough that we could trade up to land him would be **Frank Ntilikina**. I do not think that is a likely outcome. 

However, there is a solid crop of lesser regarded backup PGs in this draft who we could land by trading back to pick up an additional pick (or player). Most of these guys should be available in the second round, and certainly in the late first:

* **Jawun Evans**
* **Monte Morris**
* **Frank Mason III**
* **Kobi Simmons**
* **PJ Dozier** 
* **Marcus Keene** 

Evans is the only one of those guys who has a decent shot at going in the first round. He's a sophomore PG from Oklahoma State with tremendous talent. He'd go much higher if he weren't undersized. 

Morris and Mason are the two guys who intrigue me the most. Both are seniors from the Big XII. Mason just swept every National Player of the Year award, while Morris has been one of the nation's best passers for four straight years. As older prospects, they could be ready to make an immediate impact a la Norman Powell and Malcolm Brogdon. 

Simmons is a one-and-done freshman. Dozier is a sophomore with positional versatility and a huge wingspan. Marcus Keene is 5'9, but he led the nation in scoring. 

#Bonus: **Sign a UDFA PG**

I think there's a very good chance that as many as 5 of the draft options I listed above could go undrafted. If that happens, OKC could sign them without having to trade for or buy a second round pick. 

# Conclusion

The obvious danger in any of the draft options is that we'd be relying on a rookie to solve the team's biggest problem, which is always a dicey proposition. If we do draft a PG, I expect one of two things will happen: either Presti will keep Christon (signaling that the franchise has faith he is an NBA-caliber backup), or Presti will dump Christon and sign/trade for a veteran backup.

Presti has a big decision to make this offseason because Andre is going to get an offer from some team that will be over $10 million per year. These are the options:

1. Match the offer (Bird Rights) and keep Andre, trading Kanter + Singler to make space.
2. Match the offer, dump salary with Kanter + Singler then trade Andre at the 2018 deadline for a wing who can shoot.
3. Let Andre walk, then trade Kanter and Singler for a wing who can shoot, and maybe find a back up point guard who is capable of playing basketball.

"First, I just want to remind everyone that we are a very young team. Our entire FRANCHISE is young. 


Our head coach is only in his 2nd year and new to the league's style of play -- and that was obvious this year and especially in the last game. 


We just experienced a first as a franchise -- a major free agent loss. 


Even Russell Westbrook is new to being the undisputed #1 guy -- and damn the haters... he's done ONE HELL of a job. I've been one of his biggest fans since season 1 in OKC and even I am surprised at how this man has grown and lead this team. I predicted Russ would average a triple-double last off-season and took a lot of shit for it on facebook -- and yet I'M STILL taken aback at how great he's been.


JERAMI GRANT. This dude is playoff material. I didn't see it in the regular season. His lack of experience was very obvious in the regular season. But it was obvious in this series that he is one of those kinds of people who can step up when needed and on the biggest stage. JERAMI is a big part of our future.


Steven Adams. We all know he has it. We don't necessarily need him to be an All-Star center. Let the haters say ""he hasn't developed"" and then he'll pop up at the best of time to put our team up in various ways. He plays a tough role of an on-court mercenary and it suits him well. He's young and almost as new to basketball as Jerami Grant is.


ABRINES. His defense has stepped up in these playoffs. This is his first year in American ball. He will be part of our future. Young. International experience (or lack of US experience). This is a pattern on this roster and they're all new to this team, league, or game.


DIPO. No, he wasn't the #2 guy we needed him to be. But, he is clearly a very capable player that you can count on for defense and hustle. He's had a bad rep because of his potential back when coming out of the draft from Indiana. However, and unfortunate, when KD left it shook up our lineups and it put Dipo in a bad spot. He also has a reputation for being a great leader/6th man on the second unit back in ORL and I think he can do alot of that going forward.

Taj -- hopefully we resign him. He has way more potential than the role he played in CHI. He has the 2nd most developed offensive game on this team next to Russ (discounting Kanter) which was surprising to me considering his defensive reputation.

Kanter. Also, young and international. Also may be trade bait. Still happy to have him here. I think someday he will work those defensive issues out and he will have a long career. Whether or not it is with us, we don't know.

Dougie. See Abrines. Both of these dudes. They are fearless offensive creators. And they put the effort in on defense even if they don't specialize in that.

Sabonis. Young and also international. Also a creator who has shown flashes of a two-way player as a rook. Potential trade bait but also a lot of potential for us on the floor. 

ROBES! Every championship team needs that elite defensive master. Every team needs that glue guy that you can count on mentally, and also to know that he will always be all over the floor. We need to keep this guy. If he can't make free throws, we all know we can get rebounds ala Adams-to-Russ from last night(!). And he's a hugger.

We are maybe one or two pieces away. Presti has set us up to be adaptable depending on what is available to us via free agency or trade. One right piece changes a lot on our multiple lineups. 


This year may not have been THE year. It's not over yet. But it's been ONE HELL OF A YEAR. Especially considering how young and raw this team is. And how raw of a deal we got in the offseason.

It's time to let Russell Westbrook play the whole game. He also needs to be armed with more offense.

I want to note an interesting lineup that was played this series:
Grant, McDermmott, Abrines, Oladipo, Westbrook

They destroyed the Houston defense in limited minutes and played decent defense.

The benefits of this lineup is 5-out basketball. The downfall? Grant will have to guard potentially a bigger guy. But this lineup fares well with Anderson-Ariza-Williams-Gordon-Harden lineup that is deadly on offense too.

I also do not expect Oladipo to play back-up point. Donovan blamed it on the lack of usage in regular season and how he has relied on Cole and Semaj.

They destroyed the Houston defense in limited minutes and played decent defense.

The benefits of this lineup is 5-out basketball. The downfall? Grant will have to guard potentially a bigger guy. But this lineup fares well with Anderson-Ariza-Williams-Gordon-Harden lineup that is deadly on offense too.

I also do not expect Oladipo to play back-up point. Donovan blamed it on the lack of usage in regular season and how he has relied on Cole and Semaj.

I mean I like Billy Donovan most of the time when he's not doing his dumb experiments. But as a head coach you have to have your players backs and have their best interests. Andre Roberson had a fantastic game and this will unfortunately be overshadowed because Billy Donovan didn't want to take him out when he was at a huge disadvantage. This is one of the situations which will determine whether you are a good coach or a bad coach. He's gotta change this mess or we're going home after game 5.,Billy Donovan has to stick up for his guys more... I mean I like Billy Donovan most of the time when he's not doing his dumb experiments.

"We couldn't keep Russ because he was 100% ditching last summer

We couldn't be relevant again this season.


Russ couldn't be favourite for MVP.

I know it's still unlikely, but Im' going to choose to believe with everything I have that we're going to come back in this one, and even if it doesn't happen, then so be it. 

This season has been unbelievable either way, some of the most fun I've had in my time watching any sport. Watching the Triple-double record was just awesome, and it was absolutely historic. Amazing comeback after amazing comeback, with Russ being unstoppable, was just exhilirating, and I won't forget it.

So whatever happens happens.

"For sure: Russ Adams Taj Gibson


Ill be damned if we trade Jerami Grant, he's gonna be something great soon. Definitely should be our starting PF when Taj gets too old after next year or two. 

Roberson should without a doubt stay  - if we cant find a scoring forward. Also playoff robes should stay forever. 

Dipo and Kanter are possibilities to trade. 

I know people get mad if you're hard on dipo. I like the dude. And maybe he needs more time, or maybe this is about the best he'll do and definitely isnt a good second option. But the fact that we desperately still need another scoring option who can create his shot after paying this dude 80 million kind of says it all doesnt it?

If we trade dipo Im fine with moving Abrines in his spot. Abrines will have to improve his defense, but hell be a way better shooter than dipo ever will be. 



Kanter gotta go, he's only reliable in the regular season. Whats the point if we have guys who cant play in the playoffs?

Singler gotta fucking go. Just let him leave shit. 

Norris Cole needs to stay, way better than semaj just needs more time with the team. Semaj is a good 3rd pg because he has athleticism and can defend, but isnt a good 2nd pg and wont be for a couple years.

I dont care what we do with sabonis, at all. Yes he has talents, but until he improves dramatically he'll be riding the bench for a while. Im more concerned with who can help in the next 2-3 years while Russ is in his prime.  He's a traffic cone on defense, has decent footwork in the post, has a possibly reliable 3pt shot, I dont think Ive ever seen him take a 2 so Idk if he can shoot midrange.

He's not athletic at all either, Idk he looked very promising although frail at the beginning of the season, but now he just looks like he has no confidence and is scared all the time on the court. He needs time if we're gonna keep him,  give it to my dude Grant if you're looking for a PF, that dude has heart and the talent to go with it right now. 



McDermott, is a toss up for me. 
Has good moments, has bad moments, maybe he just hasnt had his time to shine. 

Then again if we develop him, then we got abrines and mcdermott as knock down shooters. Team would look real good with russ dipo abrines and mcdermott shooting 3's consistently.
Plus McDermott played some Great defense last game, I was kind of shocked. You know what? I convinced myself, lets keep him. 






I think this team needs alot of development, and just a little bit of reshaping.

Cut off singler and nick I think nick is retiring anyway. 
Trade kanter and possibly Dipo or robes for a Great Two way forward. 
Keep everybody else and develop them.   
I would easily trade dipo robes and Kanter for Paul George, and tbh thats not even a bad deal at all considering he doesnt wanna play for the pacers anymore anyway. 

Also - they need to Develop the shit out of Adams, he is halfway useless nowadays. This man HAS A JUMPER, Ive seen it several times. I dont know whay they limit him to just a walking New Zealand groot who only can box out and set screens and occasionally tip a ball in but he is so much more capable then he's showing.

 Noone would see it coming if just let him shoot a couple shots a game and then maybe let him have a bigger green light. He can dribble as well, yes its different in a game, but I dont see why not let him experiment. All Im saying is they need to get to work on Making Adams worth the 100 mill he got.

"Just like that we're right back in it. We almost lost, but all that matters is that we left the night with the win. So let's get into it.

1. Just a generic observation, this has been an extremely entertaining series. This has just been a great basketball series. James Harden is incredible.

2. Our player rotations were very good tonight. This was by far the best rotations we've utilized thus far in the series. Sabonis, Christon and Singler saw 0 minutes. The 10 man rotation is a strategy I expect us to use throughout the remainder of the playoffs. Enes Kanter also only played 10 minutes, and gave us 10 points.

3. Our defensive rotations were good for the most part. Nothing really came easy for Houston. Anytime Harden would get a step on the pick and roll, the weak side defender would come across and take away the passing lane(Oladipo did this twice I believe). This was key in our victory, particularly in us building our early lead.

4. Taj Gibson went off. He was hitting everything tonight, and played extremely solid minutes down the stretch. Taj finished shooting 10-13 with 20 points, with the majority of his baskets coming on midrange jumpers. This provided a good amount of spacing. Taj also played some great switch defense against Harden, poking the ball away from him on a possession.

5. Russell got help! The others decided to finally show up tonight, and they showed up in a big way. We finished the night with 5 people in double figures. Oladipo had a solid game on both ends of the court. Hopefully this is the turning point for him.

6. Brodie played a fairly efficient game until the fourth quarter. At points within the fourth quarter I felt as if we had a few bad offensive possessions, going too early in the shot clock and not getting to the rim. However he was able to turn it around. Regardless of the missed free throws at the end, he drove to the rim instead of pulling up, and was very solid tonight.

7. I have greatly enjoyed Andre in the playoffs and hope that we pay him in the offseason. He has been very solid offensively, and played great defense. Playoff Andre is the best Andre.

Edit: I forgot to mention something. Steven Adams is a god and should be treated as such. His tip in saved us","Random Observations from Tonight Just like that we're right back in it. We almost lost, but all that matters is that we left the night with the win. So let's get into it.

1. Just a generic observation, this has been an extremely entertaining series. This has just been a great basketball series. James Harden is incredible.

2. Our player rotations were very good tonight. This was by far the best rotations we've utilized thus far in the series. Sabonis, Christon and Singler saw 0 minutes. The 10 man rotation is a strategy I expect us to use throughout the remainder of the playoffs. Enes Kanter also only played 10 minutes, and gave us 10 points.

3. Our defensive rotations were good for the most part. Nothing really came easy for Houston. Anytime Harden would get a step on the pick and roll, the weak side defender would come across and take away the passing lane(Oladipo did this twice I believe). This was key in our victory, particularly in us building our early lead.

4. Taj Gibson went off. He was hitting everything tonight, and played extremely solid minutes down the stretch. Taj finished shooting 10-13 with 20 points, with the majority of his baskets coming on midrange jumpers. This provided a good amount of spacing. Taj also played some great switch defense against Harden, poking the ball away from him on a possession.

5. Russell got help! The others decided to finally show up tonight, and they showed up in a big way. We finished the night with 5 people in double figures. Oladipo had a solid game on both ends of the court. Hopefully this is the turning point for him.

6. Brodie played a fairly efficient game until the fourth quarter.

"I posted that Thunder should sign Iggy or Mirotic but that won't work. Thunder will only be able to re-sign their current players, the players they draft, and the ones they re-call from the d-league. Or of course, a trade.

But I don't think trading Kanter will help us out. Sure, he is bad on defense. But he gives it his all. He played only 7 minutes yesterday and got 3 blocks. So he has potential. He wants to win. And we all saw yesterday how our bench collapses when Kanter is out.

Here is what I think we should do: Re-sign Taj for one year. (We can sign him for up to about $13.5 Million). Roberson will probably be signed by a different team. Nick Collison will retire and Norris Cole will most likely not be on the team next year as well.

I think Jerami Grant will be a good replacement for Andre Roberson. But I don't think he should start. And having Taj, Sabonis, Kanter, and Adams on the frontcourt, I don't see us re-calling or drafting any player in that position. Plus Jerami Grant can play PF at times.

So we'll need to draft a PG and also re-call Huestis or Hamilton and that's pretty much the only thing we can do aside from trading. And I'm fine with it because I believe that our team will progress next year.

"I understand Presti chose Donovan over Brooks, that this decision may or may not have led to KD leaving. However, Donovan is a far better tactical coach within a series and with in-game adjustments.. With that out of the way. Presti built a dynamic squad around KD and Russ both being here. Really to the point I'm dumbfounded on why KD left thinking he didn't have a chance with OKC to win a title this year before he bounced.


The way this team now is structured now, is that we have a wide variety of players who can only play offense or defense stacked up at the same positions: Adams/Kanter... Roberson/Abrines/McDermott (maybe bc of trade this year)/Huestis/Singler.. Oladipo/Semaj
This team was really designed to maximize KD and Russ together bc with these role players you can go offensive or defensive with both Russ and KD but still point up points. Additionally, you could play KD at the 3-5 and not miss a beat with any option you go. Everyone gives Presti crap for the team this year, but had KD stayed he built a monster squad.. Try picking your poison as a the opposing team when you have to defend as a starting lineup:

Then when you want to sub KD/Westbrook you could see: Adams/Kanter/Roberson/Oladipo/Westbrook....Adams/Kanter/KD/Roberson/Oladipo....

"I am not giving up on the Thunder at all, I think they can even the series at home and learn some things for the following games. Maybe it's just the optimist in me, but I did see a lot of improvement from Game 1 to Game 2. 

  Now, I am not an avid basketball fan but have been supporting our team since Day 1 when they arrived here in OKC. We obviously are missing a gigantic hole with ""He who shall not be named"" gone, with that being another major shooter who can take over (dismissing the GSW series last year) so naturally, this year is a sort of finding ourselves as a whole. Nobody predicted Westbrook to have the kind of year he did, and nobody could. He went off and it was a blast watching and genuinely stoked for the guy as he deserves the accolades. 

  However, as I understand that he is a freak of nature and, naturally, would want him to take the game-winning shot if he's open (hell, sometimes even if he isn't) I can't seem to shake the fact that he either hasn't had time to re-adjust from how he played this year to the playoffs. My wish was that after he had sealed the Triple-Double record, he would have switched to give his teammates confidence going into the playoffs by distributing the ball around and getting a feel for them and getting them comfortable. I know that there were not many games between those two events. 

 I get that he has the Hero mentality. I saw him passing the ball and distributing it to a few teammates and they wouldn't follow through, which leads me to believe he just thought to take the game over, and in that he missed some very open assists that would have helped. Plus, I did not understand why he tried to draw a foul at the 3-pt line with about 1:40 to go (if I remember right) when he could have pulled up, faked the defender and had a wide open uncontested 3 to bring us within 2 or 4 pts (sorry, I can't recall specifically). I mean, I ""get"" it, you make the three and get a chance at 4 pts, but when nothing else was working, why risk it? you're down 1 game on the road and about to be down 2-0 in the series. My criticism could be unfounded and I may be missing the point, but I still feel like you would want the almost guaranteed points, than a possible foul and a terrible shot. 

  Looking towards next year, though, assuming Westbrook stays, who do you guys think would be a perfect trade/pickup to compliment his abilities? What even are the options we have for trades? 

  As a team, they need desperately to be better with rebounds. I get that the game these days are more fast-paced and it seems almost anyone can shoot the ball, but not having a chance at getting a basket off the rebound is blood-curdling and it seems that is a consistent issue. Sure, they may have a good rebound night, but it's not the norm. That could be a managing decision though. 

 As for Westbrook, nobody really knows what's going on inside his head. When he talks, he seems like he's an extremely focused guy and sometimes it's in his detriment. They need a guy that can come in and be a reliable shooter. Although, assuming McDermott stays as well, he definitely could fulfill that role and maybe an off-season with them they could establish a relationship. 

 What do you guys think? Also, if we made some trades, who do you all think would go and what could we get for them? realistic and optimistic answers welcomed. What do you guys see that needs fixing as well? Sorry for the long text, thanks for reading if you made it this far. ","About last night and Looking towards next year.

"We gotta stop using ""his team mates are horrible"" excuse. Yes everyone is literal ass when he's not in. I mean he had to come in at the start of the fourth instead of at 9 minutes like he normally does just to stop that Houston run, but playing tired all the more reason to trust your teammates. He was consistently missing open teammates to take bad shots. I can give him a break when it's crunch time and he does it once or twice. However, the whole fourth quarter of this game was basically crunch time and he was missing shot after shot after shot. He played phenomenally in the first 3 quarters. He was making his teammates better and taking mostly good shots. I understand and except that he's going to play a bit of hero but come on 4/18......

I mean he had to come in at the start of the fourth instead of at 9 minutes like he normally does just to stop that Houston run, but playing tired all the more reason to trust your teammates. He was consistently missing open teammates to take bad shots. I can give him a break when it's crunch time and he does it once or twice. However, the whole fourth quarter of this game was basically crunch time and he was missing shot after shot after shot. He played phenomenally in the first 3 quarters. He was making his teammates better and taking mostly good shots. I understand and except that he's going to play a bit of hero but come on 4/18...... We need a player like draymond green or lance Stevenson who's gonna get in his face when he's just not passing.

"Russell Westbrook deserves more. You all have downvoted in the past when I was being honest. But Russ deserves a better supporting cast. He can't do it by himself, despite his greatness. He NEEDS better players around him, and players that are suited to his style of play. 

Sam Presti has made an amazing amount of single player deals and acquisitions to help the Thunder, but how many of his multi-player deals have actually worked out? We keep getting players that can't even. This off season is the time for him to really make it happen. 

I hate to say it, but Taj probably won't be in OKC next season, for a starting point here. And that sucks. 

Billy Donovan shouldn't have ever been brought in. Scotty Brooks was getting us there, even though we had to deal with untimely player injuries. Presti screwed us all. Presti CAN do wrong and has done so. 

Durant was sold on our system, then his coach (our coach) was cut loose (despite what they told KD), to bring in a friend of Presti to coach. Think about that, FFS. No wonder KD bounced. 

I'm just trying to get the cognitive wheels turning. This team, quite unfortunately, isn't very good. But we've got Russell, for now, who might even be able to get the Nets into the 8th seed. I love the young talent in Abrines and Sabonis. There is so much to love and enjoy about this team, but it's not what it should be, lack of free agents be damned. 

Presti needs to make some serious moves, or we might lose Russ. I flippin hope not, but I want us to be a real title contender again. Jesus meeting concluded, though I'm sure I'm going to get an earful. It's time to be realistic about our team.

"1) Westbrook runs P&R with Adams alot.
Let's compare this to Harden and Curry. Why not run more motion to force switches?
Ariza, Anderson, both are all picking for Harden too. Harden can be matched up with an inferior guard early in the shotclock.

I feel like Westbrook does not care who is guarding him. But in reality, with players like Roberson where Harden hides, it is better for Roberson to not just stand in the corner and to constantly set off-ball and on-ball picks.

If you watch Harden or Curry play, they are always forcing a switch onto a different defender early in the shotclock. And then you start to either run isolation or pick and roll.

"What a shit show. I try to stay level headed when I make these, and I'll attempt to do the same here tonight. So let's get into it.

1. Russ was exhausted. In my opinion Russ shouldn't have subbed himself in so early in the fourth. You could tell he was gassed by the end. At the same point, his 41 shots are too many. This can be attested to the rotations that were put out, predominantly in the fourth. For most of the fourth the only jump shooter was Bricktor, and he's been anything but for awhile now. We need to do a better job with rotations on the offensive side of the ball. We can't have Russ shooting that much.

2. Oladipo has been dog shit offensively. Plain and simple. On defense he was solid until his absolute meltdown off ball in the fourth quarter. We need him.

3. Steven was solid but got in foul trouble. While I may not necessarily agree with the calls, he has to be more cautious. Overall he played a great game.

4. Jerami Grant had a -20. While I get the mindset of playing him, it clearly did not work.

5.  Expect Doug to get more minutes. Doug played a great game tonight, and I'm not sure why we didn't play him more. We could've certainly used him.

I am still holding on to a thread of hope. We've been playing like we did in the two losing streaks we had in the second half of the season, but I believe we can break out. We started out great, but tailed off. If Lou Williams stays on fire, we are in trouble. Discussion in the comments is encouraged. See you all next time

In the modern era of basketball, and with a superstar in Russ who thrives off of open lanes, we feature one of the most postup heavy offenses in the league- and we're among the worst in the league in actually hitting them.

We have the LEAST ball movement- on and off- in the entire league. Passes (last), secondary/hockey assists (second last), spot up shooting (last), offball screens (last)...

"Someone mentioned that this was half the squads first playoff game - **half**. This is a new team basically barring Adams, Roberson, Kanter and our basketball based god Westbrook.

This isn't an excuse if we lose first round but it's a fact - it took Russ and KD more than a few seasons to be title contenders every single year so taking about blowing the team up at this stage or trading Oladipo/Adams/Kanter is extremely short-sighted.

Sabonis, Abrines, Grant and even Christon (cannot believe I'm saying that) need another season to prove their worth to the franchise.

Taj Gibson will be our Perkins 2.0. Doug McDermott needs to find his place in the rotation because we need shooters off the bench. I don't mind Norris Cole doing a Derek Fisher impression for us in the playoffs either.

"First of all, he is only 24. This is his first season with us and he's doing a good job. Lots of people just bash on our players every time they had a bad game. Trust me, Westbrook/Oladipo will be even better next year. We can't just trade Oladipo and Kanter for a superstar and just expect everything to work out. 

We tend to let players go before they hit their prime. And bunch of fans, especially on facebook just demand Donovan trades a player who played bad.

They had a bad game against the Rockets, so what, it happens. Next game they'll out play them and the whole narrative will be switched. Our backcourt situation is good. Semaj is slowly developing to a good back-up. In the past 5 games, he played 112 minutes total and did not get a single turnover. A rookie who is 24. Abrines beat the record for most 3 pointers set by a thunder bench player the whole season. Also a rookie.

Our main goal this summer is to develop our bench. Roberson and Taj will most likely be gone next season. Our goal is to fill up those positions with good role players. If we trade Dipo for a SF then we have a liability on SG. Trade Kanter and who runs our bench?

What I would love to see is a player like Iguodala or Nikola Mirotic join us. Maybe we can move a player from the d-league and have one rookie in our line-up.

But we don't need shooters anymore. We just need to utilize our current ones properly. And what would be the most beneficial is a SF who can help us space the floor or drive to the basket. While also being a good defender, and I see Iguodala being just that.","We shouldn't trade Oladipo First of all, he is only 24. This is his first season with us and he's doing a good job.

But we don't need shooters anymore. We just need to utilize our current ones properly. And what would be the most beneficial is a SF who can help us space the floor or drive to the basket.

"All of r/NBA has experienced the Houston clan circle jerking to anything thats remotely Harden>Westbrook. 
Why act like that?
I just came from a post where they're were multiple people stating that Westbrook has no argument for MVP at all. Ah, what? I don't get it, it's EXTREME narrow-mindedness. I personally love James and what he's done this year is amazing, and he definitely has a very strong case for MVP. How can any NBA fan not acknowledge that? Likewise, what Russ has done this year is amazing as well, another strong case for MVP. But theyll refuse even acknowledge that. Which simply put is mind blowing. Whoever wins will be deserving of it.
If Harden wins MVP/ or if Houston takes this series- then them boys n girls in their sub will only talk about how poor OKC performed, or about how Westbrook tied his shoe the wrong way. I don't get it. Obviously everybody wants their own team/guy to win, but I can not comprehend why you would represent your team that way.

"Was listening to down to dunk podcast, and it has really made me think what we should do in the offseason.

This team is good but it does not suit Russ, we need to make changes if we want to get better. Their was a memorable quote I heard from the podcast ""I would be stunned if Enes Kanter is on this roster next season""

This had me thinking, we wouldn't and shouldn't give Enes up for nothing, if we do move him along (reluctantly) we need it for a proven consistent starting 3 pt threat. Not sure how much cap space Enes could free up, but i'm sure it's too less to sign a BIG FA

Any thoughts on this, tbh we need to change something around this team, we can't keep wasting Russ's qualities around people who don't fit around him.","In the offseason Was listening to down to dunk podcast, and it has really made me think what we should do in the offseason.

"So the main ways the Rockets beat the thunder was not by 3 pt shooting, but by the PnR. There plan was to get Harden on anyone except Roberson, which they did- superbly.

So going into game 2 what do the thunder do to stop this? How do they prevent Harden getting the switch he wants? If you were Bill Donovan what would you suggest the thunder do to stop Rockets offense?

For offense it's hard for the Thunder. The Rockets plan was to congest the paint making it hard for Westbrook to do his thing in there.

"Look, hear me out: I know it is extremely unlikely that we sign him in free agency unless he takes a massive paycut (he won't). I also do not understand our situation regarding our cap space perfectly so there might be gaps in my proposition. 

I personally think that other than Russ and Adams, anyone on the team is expendable for PG13. I wouldn't mind giving up Oladipo or/and Kanter for a talent like PG13. know there might have a negative impact on our bench, but it would make our starting lineup extremely scary. AND most importantly if we click well together we could attract free agents and possibly become contenders in the near future. 

From my understanding, Oladipo and Kanter have huge contracts that are taking too much cap space and not allowing us to sign bigger talents. Roberson has also made it clear that he wants a bigger paycut which would put us in a bad position for the future.

By trading Oladipo and/or Kanter along with maybe other players on our roster (excluding Russ and Adams),our starting lineup could look like this:

Westbrook
[SG position]
Paul George
Gibson
Adams

Paul George would not only add tremendously to our offense, but he could be a good replacement for Roberson's elite defense. 
 The Pacers could accept this trade because they believe that PG13 would leave them in FA and would want something back in return.

I'm just coming up with random things to think about because I want us to become contenders ASAP! Tell me what you guys think and if this is possible. Thanks!

"The end of the regular season is here, with a great series coming up against the Rockets. I haven't had enough time to do the Random Thoughts recently, but they will return for the playoffs. I decided to give end of season grades to every player on our roster. These rankings are my own personal opinion, and I will do my best to justify them. Let's get into it.

Russell Westbrook - A++

I am in love with this man. Seeing him break the record in the middle of my accounting class made me shed a tear(which looked weird I'm sure, but that's ok). He has willed us to the playoffs. This team was built for two superstars. Instead, we lost one and were unable to make any real roster moves. Brodie brought us here on his back, and is my MVP.

Victor Oladipo - B-

Victor has done a pretty good job with us. His grade would be higher if it weren't for his inconsistencies as of late, as well as his injury problems for most of the year. When healthy, he has been a solid contributor, playing both solid offense and defense. I look forward to seeing him in the playoffs.

Andre Roberson - B-

Andre has had a career year scoring wise, even though he continues to be a liability on offense. His defense has been stellar all year, as expected. I look forward to seeing him lock up Harden.

Taj Gibson - B

Taj has been a welcome addition for us. He has been about as consistent as anyone on our roster on the offensive end. His addition not only helped our offense, but also helped our rotations, as Sabonis can now come off of the bench.

Steven Adams - C

Steven Adams has not done nearly enough to impress me this year. While he has had an ok season, he has seemed very tentative on offense. He also can't catch, helping to increase Brodie's turnover numbers. On top of all this, he has struggled consistently in the pick and roll, which is a concern for me. Overall, he hasn't had a good season, but he hasn't necessarily had a bad one either.

Enes Kanter - B-

Enes has done a solid job in the sixth man role. While inconsistent at times, he has once again been a solid contributor. Some of you may be asking, ""Why give him a B- if he has been solid?"" Well, he punched a chair and broke his arm, and still doesn't play that well on defense.

Doug McDermott - C

Doug has been very inconsistent since we have acquired him. Sometimes he's hitting all the shots we need him to hit, other days he isn't hitting anything. If we are going to beat Houston, Doug will have to perform consistently.

Domanatas Sabonis - C

Sabonis was as advertised. A raw, yet talented big, who showed flashes of his potential to be a stretch 4 throughout the year. Sabonis' offensive game struggled at times, as did his defense. Overall, he performed up to expectations, and will hopefully be a bigger contributor for years to come.

Jerami Grant - B

What a pleasant surprise Jerami has been this year. Between his athleticism, his defense, and his improved three point shot, Jerami has been an extremely solid contributor all year, performing above expectations.

Alex Abrines - B+

Alex has performed very well in his first year in the league, particularly with his three point shooting. Alex has been the best three point shooter on our team. His biggest weakness is his defense, but he has plenty of time to improve.

Semaj Christon - F

He has just been god awful all year. He puts the unicorn Kyle Singler to shame. His greatest contribution to the team this year was hitting the shot that gave Russell the last assist he needed for his 42nd triple double. For that, he will always be remembered.

Kyle Singler - D-

Kyle didn't play nearly as much as Semaj(thank god), but in the limited games he did play in, he still outperformed him. He has shown a little glimpse of still remaining offensive ability, but that's about it.

Norris Cole - F-

He has been here for a limited time, but he has yet to contribute anything really. Semaj has beaten him out for the backup point guard spot, think about that.

Nick Collison - A+

I love Mr. Thunder.

Josh Huestis - N/A

Josh hasn't played nearly enough to be rated, but he does have the possibility of getting a roster spot next year.

Billy Donovan - A

I respect the hell out of this man. He took a limited amount of talent to a playoff spot, all while limiting Brodie's minutes to just 34.6 a game. I truly believe that with him at the helm, we can beat just about everyone.

I am overall pretty satisfied with how this team has played. While there are certainly holes on this team(See: Three Point Shooting), they have played solid throughout the year. Russell Westbrook is the MVP. Andre Roberson might make an All Defensive Team. We are going to be alright, and I look forward to an entertaining series with the Rockets.

"Did you guys look at the 3P% for both teams? I decided to look at this because I know it will be Rocket's biggest strength against us. So I looked at each player's 3P% pre all-star and post all-star game. These were the results:

(The left is pre all-star game and the right is post all-star game)

Harden - .353%/.332%

Beverley - .390%/.366%

Ariza - .354%/.315%

Anderson - .405%/.397%

Lou - .385%/.318%

Gordon - .385%/.339%

Dekker - .323%/.310%


But I heard Dekker has been ruled out with a broken hand.


*Now the Thunder:*

Westbrook - .338%/.352%

Oladipo - .354%/.380%

Roberson - .240%/.263%

Semaj - .190%/.190%

Abrines - .375%/.388%

McDermott - .373%/.362%

Sabonis - .315%/.343%

Grant - .381%/.344%

After the all-star game Rockets did not have a single player improve their 3 point shooting percentage. Whereas the Thunder had 6/8 improve theirs. I counted Semaj and Roberson because they are still in the rotation. But I know they rarely shoot 3's.

So the 3 point % leaders after all-star game are: 

1. Ryan Anderson - .397%
2. Alex Abrines - .388%
3. Victor Oladipo - .380%
4. Patrick Beverley - .366%
5. Doug McDermott - .362%","Am I the only one who noticed the 3P%? Did you guys look at the 3P% for both teams? I decided to look at this because I know it will be Rocket's biggest strength against us. So I looked at each player's 3P% pre all-star and post all-star game. These were the results:

"Russell, from when you were first drafted to now I've always supported you. I'm not just saying this since Kd left but you were always the person I strive to be(obviously not nearly athletic). Kd was known as the perfect player who could do no wrong and you were the turnover machine who didn't pass. But when I saw you play I knew you were different, you were a freak of nature. Sure you had flaws, but you were always the one who was going to give us all you had to the very last minute. You were the one who would fight past any injury if it would help your team and I thought you would never get acknowledged for how great you truly were. I thought you'd always just be the ""sidekick"". If you passed you were trying too hard, if you scored you were a ballhog, if you rebounded you were statpadding. But thats not true. When Kd left last summer I was obviously disappointed but I saw a potential for you to create something that transcends basketball itself. I saw a chance for you to finally get recognized and appreciated by the same community that would often criticize your every mistake. Now you've made history and are a legend in every sense of the word. You've proven to everyone that you're deserving of this praise, you've proven that you can carry a team on your back. But we already knew it. When we Kd left people said you were holding him back but nobody considered the opposite could also be true.  With or without MVP. You'll always be our hero.

"Unsure if this is allowed or not so feel free to remove if I'm breaking any rules.

Bill Simmons has posted another one of his ""Houston were supposed to be a weaker team"" tweets and using his mailbags/general opinion to discredit Westbrook's historic season.

He goes on in his recent mailbag podcast about how nobody cared about triple doubles until the 80's. Nobody cared about strength and conditioning in the NBA until Jordan started doing it. It's a bullshit argument - it's the evolution of the game and he's a basketball guy, so with the league getting more athletic and stronger for Westbrook to do what he's doing deserves the universal acclaim he's getting.

Russell is winning the scoring title, single handedly won us 10 games (maybe more, according to Royce Young), has broken a record that's stood for FIFTY years and got us to the playoffs when everyone thought we'd be rudderless without KD.

I'm a huge Bill Simmons fan, but he needs to stop justifying reasons not to vote for Westbrook. If Harden wins it then it'll be a footnote 20 years from now - they'll remember Russ' season more than a guy that's already broke the turnover record in a season. I can't say I'm a fan of Harden since he left OKC but he's an elite player on a top-10 franchise, I respect his game and his ability but his season against Russ' isn't a contest.

He claims that the MVP should go to a player on a contender for the title - doesn't that mean Harden is ineligible too? They're the 3rd seeds and he goes on about how the supporting cast between Houston and OKC isn't that far apart so he's basically saying it's Lebron or Kawhi for MVP.

I bet you he'll write some 5,000 word article explaining why he voted for someone not named Westbrook and used some ""advanced metrics"" to justify it. This isn't Five Thirty Eight, he was the biggest fan of Westbrook and his 90/10 theory for the past five seasons but now because he's doing it alone and all the crappy excuses, (stat padding, triple doubles aren't that big a deal, Houston has a similar supporting cast) suddenly it's not an MVP-worthy season - you can't change your own narrative.

I don't venture into r/nba - so I can't imagine what the hell is going on in there. Russ is the MVP, the players know it and anyone with an MVP vote like Simmons should know it too, especially if he cares about the history of the game. We're a lottery team with Russ, that alone should cement his case.

Apologies for the rant, I just think people who carry as much sway as Simmons does should stay the fuck away from quoting Vegas betting lines at the start of the season to justify an MVP candidate.","A Bill Simmons-related rant about Westbrook Unsure if this is allowed or not so feel free to remove if I'm breaking any rules.

"What would it take for Kawhi to be the MVP in your eyes?

In my opinion, he's the MVP because he's still an elite offensive player, is absolutely elite on defense (and this matters a lot imo), and has propelled the Spurs to 60+ wins (the Spurs supporting cast is good in paper, better than the thunder, but is very inconsistent).

I would have Westbrook as my MVP if the Thunder  won about 10 more games and remained strong in the title contender conversation (I think you guys can still make some noise in the playoffs but is it fair to say you guys aren't a top tier contender?) Something In the vein of LeBron's 08-08 Cavs (I think that team and this thunder one are really similar) that won 66 with Mo Williams as the second best player. If the Thunder were still a 55~ win team that was top 5 in the league, Russ is my MVP hands down. 

That being said, I do understand if he were to win this year. A triple double average is just amazing and he's really been the driving force for you guys.

"I was a Kevin Durant fan. Dude grew up right near me in the DMV so I followed him to the Longhorns, the Sonics, and then the Thunder.  All through the offseason, I was hoping he'd stay on the Thunder, and if he went to the Celtics or even the Wizards (my home team for the NBA), I would have followed him there. 

But if he joined the Warriors, a team with 3 all-Star talents who we were dominating with aggressive defense for the first four games of that WCF series, I wouldn't follow him because of *his* poor performance to close the series.  So I stayed. And from a Durant fan I became a Roberson, Dipo, Adams, Kanter and Westbrook fan.  I'll be a Thunder fan for life now, and Westbrook breaking the Big O record and stealing the MVP?

"Houston in the first round will definitely be a tougher matchup than either the Spurs or Grizzlies in the second round. We just matchup super badly against them because we can't defend the perimeter and that's where they dominate. They are favorites by far to win this series and it could get really ugly for us.

While being critical, I also like to be optimistic so here are things to look at: Donovan has outcoached both Pop and Kerr (until our stars couldn't end it) in his first post-season experience last year. Although we are missing a big part of our team (Durant) I have full confidence that he will give the Rockets a huge fight. 
Last post-season one of the biggest surprises was also the way Adams and Kanter have dominated those two series. If they show up the same way here, it will give Houston's bigs some trouble on both ends of the floor. 
Another thing to look at is that, Roberson has played outstanding defense on Harden and if he steps it up a notch, it will give their primary ball handler some real issues, we just have to hope that the rest of the team performs on defense as well. Let's hope Roberson is fully healthy for the playoffs because he has been out due to knee soreness. 
We are one of the best rebounding teams and Houston is not, we are also one of the best teams in transition, and one of the better teams defensively in the paint.
Last but not least, Russ has played quite well against Houston this season, and he'll be playing much longer minutes during the playoffs.
I expect our whole team to step it up on both ends of the floor, I especially want to see Russ contest every damn shot because we won't be able to afford not defending the 3 point line.

This will be a super tough series and there is a possibility that we get blown out every game. But I believe Russ and Donovan can really lead our team to win it and move on to the second round.

"Westbrook was off last night, and that's obvious. As per his quote from his interview as to why he started ""chasing"" assists, (first of all they just assume he's chasing them, not trying to help the team at all cause fuck teamwork), he said ""F---, I was 6-25. What do you want me to do?"".

Everybody goes off, saying he just admitted to stat-padding, that he's doing nothing but chasing triples, or... hear me out... maybe he was doing the right thing for his team?

First of all, I'm not assuming anything. You can't KNOW what a player is doing unless they tell you, so the fact that so many people think they just KNOW what Westbrook is doing is fucking dumb and arrogant as hell. Secondly, the ""good"" thing never occurs to them, especially in this context with how Russell is ALWAYS stat-padding or just chasing the TD.

Russell was having an off night, so why make it worse? He's the point guard and leader of the team, so why not make plays for your teammates? Maybe he's NOT dumb and actually plays basketball to win, not just for himself.

"Nothing but the worst arguments as to why Russ *shouldn't* get MVP.

* Because his team is the 6th seed, Harden's is 3rd. (Because that's what defines players.)
* His team boxes everyone out so he can grab the boards and pad his stats. (Or maybe he *needs* to get the ball first so we can make a play really quickly, which is exactly how this team is thriving. It's how we've always played, but now when it matters people are upset.)
* Billy Donovan lets Russell have complete control in order to pack on more stats. (Except he's not LeBron.)
* If both of them were averaging less rebounds, Harden would be considered and Westbrook wouldn't even be looked at. (Because the numbers he puts up don't matter without rebounds.)
* Harden is the only reason the Rockets are a 3rd seed. (Cause fuck all of the other players, thanks a LOT Westbrook for dragging us down.)
* Westbrook's style of play is losing basketball. (...not even going to comment.)
* Historically speaking, averaging triple doubles don't win MVP. (Yes, because with a sample size of ***1***, that negates any argument for Russ.)
* The Rockets were predicted to lose playoff contention this year, therefore their team is doing **AMAZING** things. (They literally finished 2nd just the last year. Nobody could have predicted anything accurately.)
* Harden should win over WB because he goes for more contested rebounds whereas Westbrook is spoon-fed. (Except their contested rebound rates have a 1% difference.)

Literally **nobody**, and I mean *nobody*, would be this salty if it wasn't this close. Nobody would judge his supporting team or win record. They wouldn't judge however he gets his rebounds.

I'm not saying that I don't know that people who are treating this MVP discussion fairly exist, even including popular broadcasters, and I'm not saying that Harden is a bad player. He's a fucking baller and if he gets the MVP, I won't be that upset because he's next in line.

But these cases that people have and think they're so smart for coming up with are incredibly arrogant and honestly disrespectful. This is absolute history regardless of who wins, and the fact that they have to pull these arguments out of their ass to disprove his MVP case gives me a lot of hope for Russ.

* Harden is the only reason the Rockets are a 3rd seed. (Cause fuck all of the other players, thanks a LOT Westbrook for dragging us down.)
* Westbrook's style of play is losing basketball. (...not even going to comment.)
* Historically speaking, averaging triple doubles don't win MVP. (Yes, because with a sample size of ***1***, that negates any argument for Russ.)
* The Rockets were predicted to lose playoff contention this year, therefore their team is doing **AMAZING** things. (They literally finished 2nd just the last year. Nobody could have predicted anything accurately.)
* Harden should win over WB because he goes for more contested rebounds whereas Westbrook is spoon-fed. (Except their contested rebound rates have a 1% difference.)

Literally **nobody**, and I mean *nobody*, would be this salty if it wasn't this close. Nobody would judge his supporting team or win record. They wouldn't judge however he gets his rebounds.

I'm not saying that I don't know that people who are treating this MVP discussion fairly exist, even including popular broadcasters, and I'm not saying that Harden is a bad player. He's a fucking baller and if he gets the MVP, I won't be that upset because he's next in line.

But these cases that people have and think they're so smart for coming up with are incredibly arrogant and honestly disrespectful. This is absolute history regardless of who wins, and the fact that they have to pull these arguments out of their ass to disprove his MVP case gives me a lot of hope for Russ.

"The last game we played against them was a bad defensive job by both teams actually. The only difference was they were on fire offensively. I mean we let them score 137 points and that's unacceptable. But they also let us score 125.

But they had 20 turnovers and we had 16. They had 79 field goal attempts but we had 94. On the free throws, we went 20/28 while they went 17/21. Now we also had 16 offensive rebounds compared to their 2. 16-2!

The only thing that really stood out to me were the 3 pointers. We went 11/30 while they went 20/39. Ariza went 6/8 and Lou Williams went 7/8. And if you look at their stats you could say that that was their best 3 point shooting. And the chances of them doing that again are unlikely.

"...where she poured some soy sauce into a glass, a good inch of it. Then she distracted me (not hard to do to a 4 year old), and switched the glass out for a glass that had a similar amount of very flat coke in it. She lifted to her mouth and sculled the whole thing. I was amazed that she was able to drink that much soy sauce without wincing (or so I thought) that I planned to emulate her one day.

When my friend came over a few weeks later I thought I would impress him the same way my sister impressed me, so a got a glass, got the soy sauce and set it all up. Of course, I still didn't know that my sister had actually only drunk coke, so I psyched my self up to drink this half-glass worth of soy sauce. I held my nose and skulled. It obviously tasted vile but for 5 seconds or so my pride got the better of me and down she went. 

Fast forward 30 minutes I tell my mom I am both extremely sick and extremely thirsty. She could tell right away that something was wrong and whisked me to the doctor. It turns out that much sodium is not good for a four year old. It had a bad reaction with my stomach, my heart, my blood stream and my psyche (I still never add soy sauce to anything). I was rushed to hospital, had my stomach pumped, and was kept on an IV drip for 48 hours.

"Simple game. What do yo do this offseason.
Here's the contracts on the books for '17-18'
Russ: 28.5
Funaki: 22.5
Dipo: 21 even
Freddie Turkury: 17.8
Teen Wolf: 5.75
Singler: 4.6
McBuckets: 3.3
Saboner: 2.5
Huestis: 1.21
Grant: 1 (club option)
Backwards James: .9

So the cap is projected to hit around 108 Million next year.

The team as is puts us around 109. 

Not great. Add in we have a first round pick who will hopefully contribute and cost about 1 mil/year we are still hovering around the cap. 
I think as the second youngest team Dipo and Adams will step up big time. (they better with the huge jumps in $ they'll be making). Abrines and Sabonis will also get better and I have faith in Presti finding a solid player late in Rd 1 of the draft. 

This leaves us with Taj and Robes... What to do... either way we're headed towards the luxury tax guys. I say we let Robes walk if he demands anything north of 11 mil/year. Maybe we can bring Taj back but it would have to be for a real bargain and ultimately takes minutes away from Sabonis. So what to do... 
1. Do we trade Enes? We all love him but paying nearly 40 million a year (40% the cap) to centers is nuts. It's a position that is totally devalued and they can't really play together. 
2. Do we let Robes walk? (draft his replacement & play Grant/McBuckets more)
3. Can we resign Taj? Is it worth it?

It's a tough couple of decisions but the path I'd take (as of today) is...
1. Deal Kanter for a late first/wing who can make a shot. (Milwaukee, Dallas, Minnesota, NYK, Charlotte, Atl)
2. Stretch Singler
3. Cut Semaj & Huestis
4. Bring back Robes at no more than 11 a year
5. If Robes bounces then resign Taj @ about 10-12/year for 2 years
6. Draft a wing/back up pg with our pick

"Forget about the rebounds. Uninteresting. Let's look at the assists. Russ is averaging roughly 10 assists per game. That may just seem like a stat, but do you know what that actually means? Let's break it down.

What is an assist? An assist is attributed to a player who passes the ball to a teammate in a way that leads to a score by field goal (according to a quick google search). This means that Westbrook's teammates are getting the ball passed to them, by Westbrook (ridiculous), and then shooting the ball. And making it! That's even more ridiculous. 

It took me a while to realize this, but you can read the body language of all of the players. You see Westbrook's right shoulder twitch out of pure excitement when he realizes he can get that sweet, sweet assist. Now let's look at Kanter. Kanter catches the pass, and you can see his intent in his eyes. He doesn't want the points. He doesn't want the win. He says to himself ""I have to get this assist for Baby Russ"". 

Clearly, if he wanted to win, he would have done something different. I don't know what he should have done different, but he definitely should not have given Russ an assist. I was pulling for Russ for MVP, but after making this disgusting realization, I can no longer do that. If only Russ was actually good, then we could all celebrate. If only his teammates didn't help him pad his stats. I'm sick to my stomach.

/s just in case I'm terrible at communicating sarcasm.","Confirmed: Westbrook's teammates are helping him pad stats. Forget about the rebounds. Uninteresting. Let's look at the assists.

"If you're like me and you watch the NBA when the Thunder aren't playing, I got to see three of Houston's latest road games in Portland, Golden State and Phoenix. Prior to this, I haven't seen any of their games, even when OKC played them, I for some reason missed watching the games.

Here lately, I've seen some making the case that Harden's supporting cast isn't as good as OKC's. What? Granted, these were comments on ESPN articles and Twitter posts, so I don't think these are mainstream journalists going out of their way to make this point (if you've seen some, let me know). 

STARTING LINEUP

Center: Clint Capela (HOU) vs Steven Adams (OKC) - Obviously Adams has the edge here in terms of career numbers, Capela this year is averaging 12.3 points, 8.1 rebounds and 1.2 blocks per game, compared to Adams with 11.5 points, 7.6 rebounds and 1.0 blocks per game. Their numbers in other areas are also very similar, so it's almost a wash with Adams having more playoff experience, games played and career starts. 

EDIT: forgot to write in here ""Slight edge to Adams.""

Power Forward: Ryan Anderson (HOU) vs Damontas Sabonis/Taj Gibson (OKC). Can't throw in Taj full time as the comparable player with limited time spent in OKC, but let's assume for a moment it is. Anderson still takes the edge. He's not a better defender, but the offense he provides far exceeds what Gibson brings on defense. Anderson also grabs slightly more rebounds than Taj, who doesn't even dare shoot a three pointer. Edge to Anderson.

Small Forward: Trevor Ariza (HOU) vs Andre Roberson (OKC). Roberson is certainly more athletic at this point in both their respective careers, but Ariza edges out Roberson in just about every other aspect of the game. He's got the experience, the defensive prowess, better shooting, and I'm pretty sure Ariza never air-balled a free throw. Edge to Ariza.

Shooting Guard: Patrick Beverley (HOU) vs Victor Oladipo (OKC). This is an interesting matchup because there is no debate who is a better defender (Beverley) and the better shooter (Oladipo). I'm going to say this is a wash. They're both the second-best guards on their teams. Beverley might be a better complement to Harden to offset his defense, yet Oladipo can play the point when Russ is on the bench. If I had to pick one, I would say Beverley, but I'm leaving it at a wash.

BENCH

Center: Nene Hilario (HOU) vs Enes Kanter (OKC) - Nene has the edge with experience, but Kanter scores more, is a better free throw shooter and overall offensively plays a key role in OKC's bench for picking up the slack when Russ is on the bench. Defensively, Nene is by far a better defender. Still, Nene doesn't outperform Kanter on defense when it comes to the stat sheet. Edge to Kanter.

Power Forward: Montrezl Harrell (HOU) vs Damontas Sabonis/Jerami Grant (OKC) - Not easy to break this one down considering the position has not been concrete since OKC got Taj Gibson. Regardless, both OKC players are young and average just under 6ppg. Harrell, in his second season, averages 9ppg. All three shoot about 62% on FTs. Sabonis can space the floor though with his 3 point shooting ability. I gotta say it's a wash. Each does one or two better than the other, but the results on the scoreboard even out.

Small Forward: Sam Dekker (HOU) vs Doug McDermott (OKC) - Both comparable players in terms of skillset, but Douggie McBuckets gets the edge with experience, 3P% and FT%. Both bring about 6 ppg, and Doug's role on the team isn't quite established in terms of minutes. Edge to Dougie.

Shooting Guard: Eric Gordon (HOU) vs Alex Abrines (OKC) - No point in discussing much on this one. Gordon is an NBA journeyman who is actually starting for Houston the past several games, and Abrines is a rookie still getting his feet wet coming off the bench. Edge to Gordon.

Point Guard: Lou Williams vs. Semaj Christon (OKC) - Another NBA journeyman compared to a rookie. Williams is averaging 15 points per game, which is more than Kanter. Edge to Williams.

HONORABLE MENTIONS

~~Kyle Singler~~

So in recap, Houston has two better starters to OKC's one, with a wash at SG. The bench though is clearly better at guard for Houston, and the players who edge out Houston's are only slightly better. 

Here's the real glaring stat though: **games played**. Houston's 9 mentioned have a combined 4,169 games played, with a couple having championship rings. OKC has a combined 2,457, including three rookies.

Then compare coaches. Mike D'Antoni has always been regarded as one of the better coaches in the league. Whenever he gets fired, there's another team ready to scoop him up immediately, and he's managed to get good results as well. Donovan is in his second NBA season and is an unproven commodity, despite having a great first season last year.

I hope you find this to be useful.

I am just wondering how he is when it comes to firing players up. He seems to always have a cool calmness to him and I get that is a good thing but sometimes I feel like he lacks the fire to get players back into games.

"Hey everybody I wanted to set in stone an argument for **Russell Westbrook as MVP.**  First of all I am just a fan (OKC fan) ... not a writer, not a blogger, not even a full time redditor.... I just wanted to give my (well researched) opinion...


I started checking out some stats and taking notes. A few hours later I found myself finishing up my final thoughts on this year’s MVP race. First things first *this is a close race*. It’s been one of the most fun MVP runs and NBA seasons in general in a long time. There’s been eye popping numbers seemingly every night. Lebron James has been typical Lebron (in a lot of ways better) and it’s a shame his skills not diminishing one iota is getting lost in the shuffle amid all the historic performances. Kawhi Leonard has been the heart and soul of yet another 50-60 win Spurs team. He’s taken over the Duncan mantle in every way. He’s the best defender in the league and an underrated killer in the clutch. In the end though this MVP race comes down to two players. One a silky smooth old school swag machine with the beard of a wizard. The other a vendetta seeking hell-bent supersonic whirlwind of ass kicking and name taking. 


Harden v. Westbrook		Brodie v. The Beard 		Goatbrook v. El Chapo	


Shall we break it down…


1. The Stats


      SCORING: 	Westbrook is #1 in PPG (31.8). Harden #2 (29.4)
          Westbrook is asked to score more and handle a larger load but he does shoot more. I could see places switched (Harden on OKC, Russ on HOU) Harden could score 32+ppg. That being said Russ and the vendetta he’s on in D’Antoni’s system would be incredible.



      ASSIST:		Harden is #1 (11.3) Westbrook #3 (10.4). 
          So Russ is less than an APG behind Harden and the league lead despite playing the majority of the season with the likes of Singler, Morrow, a rookie Sabonis, Andre “airball freethrows and side of the backboard from the corner” Roberson. The best two offensive players sans Russ are Kanter and Dipo and they’ve missed 10 and 15 games respectively. 
          Compare that to Houston’s 2nd and 3rd best scorers (Gordon & Anderson) and they have combined to only miss 13 games total. 
          Last tidbit each team made additions at the deadline that would benefit the assist #’s for each guy. For OKC it’s been a nice two man game with Taj Gibson and some floor spacing from McBuckets. The Rockets added the odds on favorite for 6MOY Lou Williams. Both additions have helped each team and the MVP case for each guy so I’d say it’s a wash here. 
          For the analytics fans Westbrook is #1 in the NBA in assist % (56) while Harden is #2 (51). Westbrook is a ridiculous ten points higher than #3 John Wall (46).



      BOARDS:	Harden is a fantastic rebounder and is averaging 8 a game. That’s damn good so let’s not get that lost in what Russ is doing. That said the way Russ is rebounding it’s truly historic. Brodie is #12 in the league in RPG (10.5) and #9 in total Rebounds. He has 48 games with 10+ rebounds and 10 games of 15+. 

Russell will become the first player since the Mailman Karl Malone in 1989-90 to average 30ppg and 10rpg. 
                    

The ""uncontested boards argument"": 
          This isn't the first time teams have had their superstar get free throw rebounds. If it really is than it sets a precedent. Rockets, Cavs, Pels, Pacers do it. Get your franchise guys some easy #'s. 
          It's been debated to death but here's my 2 cents... as a guy who's watched 40+ OKC games.... Presti built this team on the fly and Donovan understands the offense is dogshit when they go half court or slow it down. This team is built around Russ. The Stache Bros box out and Russ (don't forget Roberson) crash and that starts the offense. *OKC needs to play fast.* Russ pushes the tempo and strikes fear into opposing fans and backpedaling opponents. This team has zero half court game due to the lack of shooting and ball-handlers. But they have Russ and we've all seen Russ grab a board and we literally hold our breath while he blitzkriegs up court through a 2 on 5 and muscles his way to an and 1 or drops a dime. Russell is without a doubt the most aggressive player in the league and the Thunder know it. They use this knowledge guys. OKC won't win as a half court slow it down team. *It's an entire team running off his intensity and persistence.* That is the best offense the Thunder have and IT WORKS. **It sounds crazy, we're so accustom to the usage rate of mid 00's Kobe and early 00's AI being a negative but sometimes that's what it takes.** Plain and simple. This team was expecting Durant and impromptu built this team to suit Russ and it has worked to a pretty successful degree. 



  TURNOVERS:	 While both are averaging over 5 Turnovers a game (5.4 Westbrook/5.8 Harden) Russ is averaging less while seeing far more double teams and being asked to basically carry the scoring load every night on an Iverson like scale. (Russ leads the NBA with a Usage rate of 41%). Another minor point but still worth noting the Turnovers per 100 possessions or TOV% for Russ is 15.8 but 19.6 for Harden. 
          TLDR: both guys turn it over a bunch but Harden has been historical with the amount of turnovers with less usage and this shouldn’t be forgotten.  



  ADVANCED STATS TIME NERDS! (Here's the link for the STATS) http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2017_leaders.html
                   Look at these top ten list and you'll see the context. Harden is incredible. Westbrook is Historic.


  VORP- Value over Replacement Player
                    Beard has an amazing @ 8.3 but The King of the Prairie is leading the league (10.7). 
         

  BPM- Box Score Plus Minus
                    Simply put this one is similar to the last.
                    Harden is a good deal ahead of the pack but Westbrook is absolutely light years ahead. 


  Win Shares: This one Harden leads the league (14.3) and this is his biggest point in favor of him but Westbrook is fifth with (11.6)

          
  PER: We all know PER, it’s a bit flawed and skewed towards offense. That said Russell again leads the league in this category with a staggering 30.4 (good for 17th all time). Harden is no slouch being tied for 2nd in the league at 27.9 (that would place him in the 60’s all time). 


  The Absurd: So Russ may be the first *player* to average 30ppg and 10rpg sing 1990. You read that right RPG... look at this
          http://i.imgur.com/xgRFmCT.png



2. Efficiency
          Much has been stated about just how efficient Harden has been this year. In my opinion it has been a bit overstated. 
                    His True Shooting is an incredible 62% which is better than Westbrook’s 55% (still nothing to scoff at)
          *Russ has terrible shooting percentages/s....*
                    Sure Russ is shooting 42% but Harden is shooting 44%. And from 3 Russ is shooting 33% and Harden 35%. Given the spacing/shooting and better supporting cast around Harden along with Westbrook’s higher usage rate I’d say this is either a wash or favors Russ. Whether it’s bias or people just looking at box scores the idea that **Russell is a shot jacking low percentage scorer just isn’t the case relative to Harden**. Both guys carry an enormous burden leading their teams as facilitator and primary scorer so it makes sense they wouldn’t be posting Lebron like FG%’s. 



3. Quick Hits
          Neither guy has missed a game this season.
          Both guys are 84% FT shooters. Both are 1 and 2 in attempts (Harden 676 and Westbrook 651)
          Both are top 15 in total steals (Westbrook with 120 or 1.7 SPG and Harden at 111 with 1.5 SPG)



4. Defense
          Harden once a hilarious GIF making machine defensively has shown effort and improved to about average. Westbrook has more tools and came into the league as a defender but his aggressive style and risk taking has rubbed some people the wrong way. That said it’s my opinion Westbrook is a better defender but that’s really the last thing this MVP race is about.
          Quick Stat: Harden is having his best DBPM (1.3) which isn’t anything special but *Russell Westbrook is third in the NBA with  DPM of 4.5.* Higher than Giannis, Drummond, Tony Allen & Anthony Davis.  



5.	The Records
          This is really the big one and the major argument for Harden winning. It is impressive that Houston is going from a 41-41 team to a near 60 win team. But here’s the context… this wasn't a true 41-41 team. The Rockets were embroiled in turmoil in 2015-16. The two previous years they won 56 and 54 games. This was a case of a talented team led by a superstar who underachieved last year amidst a coaching crisis and a much needed change of leadership. This year the Rockets team replaced a mediocre coach Kevin Mchale with an offensive genius who’s scheme is created in a lab for a player exactly like Harden. You couldn’t ask for a player more well suited for D’Antoni’s system (we’ll elaborate on that further down). Houston also swapped out Dwight Howard (http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/outthere/files/2013/08/BHhst.jpg), Corey Brewer (Can't get minutes on a team trying to lose) and Ty Lawson (http://www.holidaywinecellar.com/images/Product/large/20530.jpg) for Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson and Lou Williams. Add in young role players Decker, Harrell and Cappella all being a year more experienced and you can see why this is a 50 win team.
          As for the Thunder they do have some good young players and the idea that it’s Bestbrook and scrubs is idiotic. That doesn’t mean his supporting cast has helped him out all year. To begin the year they had the job of integrating Victor Oladipo as secondary ball handler and the two were playing with a very underwhelming supporting crew aside from the Stash Bros. Just look at this list of names Roberson (A for defense, F for offense), Singler (F for everything including haircut), Cam Payne, Anthony Morrow and the rookies Abrines and Sabonis. This is a shitty cast of misfit broken toys. Since the additions of McDermott and Gibson and the experience under the belt of the rookies this team is 12-6 with wins over the Jazz 2x, Spurs and Raptors. My point is this team isn’t the same team it was to start the year. So while they will likely finish with between 45 and 50 wins they are a better team than that. 
          It isn't an ""on paper argument either""...on paper the Thunder go punch for punch with Houston. Gordon, Lou, Anderson, Ariza, Capella, Harrell v. Oladipo, Adams, Kanter, Gibson, Roberson, Abrines (Still give Houston the upper hand) isn't a landslide but it isn't about fit. All the Rockets guys are shooters, Roll men, D/Board guys who fit perfectly in D'Antoni's system. *The Thunder built this team based on having Kevin Durant.*
                    As of today OKC is the **Second youngest team in the league**.
          Oh and you thought I’d forget about that one thing… This is the big one… **A top 5 NBA player left the Thunder and they started the season with the replacement being Kyle Fucking Singler!** When Servant Cupcake Voldemort left people expected this team to fight tooth and nail just to make the playoffs. Last year’s Western Conference Runner Up won 55 games. This year’s team will win nearly 50!
          If we punish Westbrook for his team only getting the 4-6 seed then why are we propping up the Rockets record/seeding? It isn’t like Harden is carrying his team to 65 wins and the one seed. They’re a high 50’s win team that will finish as the 3 seed. By no means a historic team. We’ll see come playoff time but let’s just say I’m a bit suspicious of D’Antoni’s ability to succeed in the playoffs.  
                    **Stated Plainly: I don’t believe the difference in team records mean jack considering…**
          Both have top ten records in the league & are comfortably in the playoffs.
          OKC had a much worse roster top to bottom for much of the season.
          OKC lost Kevin Fucking Durant and had no replacement to step in (to no fault of their own. You don’t trade a guy like that, you just have to hope he doesn’t fuck you).  




6. Remove the player argument: 
          Almost everyone acknowledges if you take Westbrook off OKC they would be a bottom 10 team. If you remove Harden from HOU they’d likely still be playoff caliber (IMO just behind POR and DEN). 
          Remember fans, writers, gm’s, scouts, pleebs and trolls… this team was built for Durant and potentialy Al Horford (Need sources but word is if Durant resigned OKC would have got Al Horford). Everything they’ve done this year has been on the fly.




7. The D’Antoni Bump:	I don’t see this bandied about too much when people are discussing the MVP race but it’s obvious that Houston’s system gives a statistical bump to the primary ball handler. Let’s call it the “D’Antoni offensive bump”. It isn’t just Nash having his best years with Mike D’Antoni either… 
          Remember when **Kendall Marshall** was an NBA player as the PG in that system? 
          **Nate Robinson** averaged 17ppg as the primary ball handler off the bench! 
          **Chris Duhon** was a starter for the Knicks playing 30+ mpg and post D’Antoni he’s invisible and soon out of the league.
          **Raymond Felton**, while the butt of so many jokes he’s had a solid career but he had BY FAR his best season under D’Antoni. (17ppg/9apg)
          D’Antoni’s first two years he was saddled with **Toney Douglas** (Career avg of 7.6ppg) but off the bench Toney put up both his career highs in ppg (10.6 & 8.6) in just over 20mpg.
          You guys remember Linsanity? Yup D’Antoni’s last year in NYC. **Jeremy Lin** came out of nowhere to set his still career highs in Assist and Points per game. Lin has improved and become a very solid player but it’s tough to imagine Linsanity happening in any other situation.
          Finally this year’s Houston team in regards to this point is a bit of a chicken and egg scenario. Sure Harden is an incredible passer and makes teammates better and it helps secondary players like Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, Clint Capella and Montrezl Harrell. It is also true that the career resurgence for Gordon and Anderson along with big improvements for the young bigs Capella and Harrell is also due in large part to the “D’Antoni Bump”. 
Just look at the track record and it becomes obvious this system helps players statistically. 


8. Clutch
          In “Clutch Time” Russell (48) has a higher EFG% than Harden (43). 
          It’s obvious to us fans and more so to coaches who’s taking shots late game and Russell has a mind numbing 60% usage rate in the clutch and yet still sits atop the leaderboard for nearly every clutch statistic there is. 
          In games that go to “clutch time” OKC is 23-14. HOU is 20-15.
          Russell has a 38 PEI compared to Hardens 24. (Help me out here sub I don’t know exactly what NBA.com quantifies PEI as but Russ is WAY ahead…)
          In case you thought Russ took every shot in crunch time and is a ball hog to the detriment of his team well…. he has a higher Ast% than Harden in the clutch (53% to 41%)
          Russ has 425 points in the final five minutes of the fourth quarter this season. Most in 20 years. 
                     https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/847282893370015744
         You’ve seen it time and time again. Celtics fans you know (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNEoPpUg0W0). How about that Jazz game (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiiiTPj7Pwg) just after the all-star break? Most recently Russ scored 14 of the last 16 and single handedly led OKC on a 14 point comeback with less than 4 minutes to play in Dallas. And his most recent game… down 14 less than 3 minutes left… just AND 1’S and 3’s over and over. Great passing too. Dipo has been hitting those clutch dimes. This again happened on the road in Orlando and if you didn't know any better you'd think it was @ the Peak (in OKC). More than a few times Russ has received huge cheers and MVP chants on the road. You all see the games and if not you need to enlighten yourselves and check FreeDawkins and Ximo Pietro and the like on Youtube. This man is committing felony arson in the 4th quarters. 
          A small bit of Evidence: https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/622p98/russell_clutch_shot_compilation/




9. The Eye Test/Wow Factor
          This admittedly is more subjective than most the points I’ve made. It’s a bit of a Bill Simmons type of reasoning but when we look back 10-20 years from now at this season and ask what’s the biggest story line it won’t be Harden’s consistently fantastic numbers. It won’t be Kawhi’s defense. Nor LeBron’s still incredible all-around game. It’s Westbeast’s tour of destruction. 
          Westbrook is the biggest ticket in the league this year. (Brooklyn, Orlando and a few other fans are outright cheering MVP at home for a road player… that’s Jordan level respect). 
          Russell is the most explosive, fun to watch, makes the other teams fans cheer, spectacle in the NBA.  The weirdest thing about this year is how desensitized we’ve become due to Russell’s eye popping #’s and seemingly nightly triple doubles. 
          This fucking guy is going to average a Triple Double! lol it’s incomprehensible. 
          This regular season will be remembered as “the year Durant left OKC and Westbrook went Nuclear”.  


10. Storylines Matter:	They really shouldn’t so much but we’re all human and we love a good story. What’s a better story?
          James Harden lifts a talented Rockets team with a fantastic offensive coach to an impressive but ultimately flavor of the month 55+ wins. 
          Russell Westbrook goes supernova and carries a franchise… no city… nay region from the depths of despair after being dumped by the franchise’s greatest icon/player for their mortal enemy and team they just lost to on the grandest of stages. (You get the point)
                    I am biased as an OKC fan but try to put yourself in the position of one of us. You lose your franchise/city most beloved player ever. It’s in the worst possible way and his maligned sidekick takes the reigns and does this shit… **It isn’t just the numbers or wins people**.


11. Triple Doubles
          Let’s lead this off with the fact that James Harden has 19 triple doubles this season. Harden is absolutely killing it. He had 9 in his career before this season. Some context for you… Kobe, Kareem, Webber, Barkley, Baylor, Jordan and G. Hill all had individually less than 30 for their entire careers. 

     Russell Westbrook has 38 triple doubles this season. *That alone would put him 9th on the All Time Career Triple Doubles list*. **He’s three behind Oscar Robertson for most in a season with 8 games left. ** He’s likely going to have the most Trip Dubs in a season. 

     How about getting the only ""perfect"" triple double in history and the highest scoring triple double. Seems like a minor point but still historic feats.

     

     Alvin Robertson leading the league in Assist and Scoring is mythic. Westbrook will finish this season leading the league in PPG with a 30pt triple double and top 3 in assists while leading the league in scoring. 

    https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/378800000697945639/a7eeae038851851a2b0507cca1917b04.jpeg



    We all know this hasn’t been done in 55 years, only once in the history of the league and Russell is doing it in a slower era (close to 20 less possessions per game). 
    The sneaky best stat about this: **Russell is averaging this triple double in 10 minutes less per game than the Big O did**. Wednesday’s overtime comeback vs Orlando was the first time Russ has played 40+ mins since November. Hearing shit like that gets me to shake and tremble in utter confusion like a mid-rant Lewis Black. 
          People will try to discredit this stat (I honestly don't know why other than they're contrarian's or fucktards... I digress...) but seriously if this was *""so easy""* IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BY NOW. 




12.	Perspective
          It’s really like a legendary cocktail of past fabled performances…


1. The way his team depends on him, opponents focus on him, his usage and unyielding will is reminiscent of Prime Allen Iverson.
2. This may be the greatest rebounding season for a PG ever. A rich man’s Jason Kidd.
3. He has the scoring and ability to get to any spot on the floor like Young Michael Jordan.
4. He’s showcasing the passing and unselfishness of a Showtime Magic Johnson. (Hyperbolic... maybe but those role guys he's working with... Put him on Houston and he's got 2+APG)
5. His athletic dominance and stamina over his peers rivals ABA Julius Erving, 80’s ‘Nique, 80's MJ, Elign Baylor or Big O. 
6. The intensity and effort is on a Garnett/Kobe/MJ level. 



I’ll end this by asking… What does the MVP mean to you? 



We all have varying definitions and weigh the factors differently. Is it simply “Who is the best player in the league this year”? How about “Most important player”? Best player on the Best team? 


It’s certainly complicated and both Westbrook and Harden are deserving but…
    Firstly the argument (heard Simmons say it and I grinded my teeth to dust hearing it) it can only be a player on a championship contender is frankly idiotic. *There can be outliers.* This award isn’t best player on the best team. It could be argued and has been a thousand times it’s a best player on a top 3 seed but if the Thunder were in the Eastern Conference they’d be right there as a top 3 seed. Seems to me (pardon the pun) a B.S. argument.


If we ask who’s the best player in the league this year the answer is Westbrook. 


1st in PPG, VORP, BPM, OBPM, PER, AST%. 
2nd in FTA, FTM. 
3rd in DBPM, ASSIST & APG.  
5th in Win Shares and 12th in Rpg and 9th in total Rebounds. 
He’s been the most clutch player in the league. 
He’s carried a below average roster every single game to well above expectations.
He’s setting records left and right that may** literally never be broken**.


If the question is literally who’s the Most Valuable player to their given team it is close but again both candidates removed, one team would be borderline playoffs and the other a team in the lowest tier of the league. I believe value to a team and franchise is more than that though. We have to think about the story lines. What they mean to their team and city beyond just the box scores. 
     Russell Westbrook has galvanized an entire region. Inspired a generation of kids to play balls out giving maximum effort while still being a good teammate and leading by example. He’s showing the old timers that a 30 point triple double for a season was possible again. Harden is a fan favorite having a historical season and by no means is any of what I’ve stated meant to denigrate him. That said…
     No matter how we argue this… Russ is the MVP. 
a.	Russ wins the Analytics argument 
b.	Russ wins the “Storyline” argument
c.	Russ is objectively the most clutch and dominant player in the league.
d.	All due respect to the Beard but other than his team being 7-8 wins better he doesn’t have a leg to stand on.


As a diehard OKC fan my opinions may seem blunt. I have loved Harden since ASU. He’s FUCKING AMAZING GUYS. I welcome debate and think it’s healthy for the sub, the league and fandom in general. I’ve made my points and…
          

I humbly believe this is Russell Westbrook’s season. He is the Most Valuable Player however you want to slice it. This performance by Westbrook is truly a once in a lifetime experience. A season for the ages.





Shoutout to Splash2ndcousin, IamDrDre, hughwotmate1, ESPN stats and info, Royce Young, the Down to Dunk Podcast, Kevin Colabro (that’s my guy), Basketballreference, Zach Lowe, Ximo/Dawk and All the die-hard OKC fans and this sub. Best fucking Sub on Reddit!","The Case for Russ Hey everybody I wanted to set in stone an argument for **Russell Westbrook as MVP.**  First of all I am just a fan (OKC fan) ... not a writer, not a blogger, not even a full time redditor.... I just wanted to give my (well researched) opinion...


I started checking out some stats and taking notes. A few hours later I found myself finishing up my final thoughts on this year’s MVP race. First things first *this is a close race*. It’s been one of the most fun MVP runs and NBA seasons in general in a long time. There’s been eye popping numbers seemingly every night. Lebron James has been typical Lebron (in a lot of ways better) and it’s a shame his skills not diminishing one iota is getting lost in the shuffle amid all the historic performances. Kawhi Leonard has been the heart and soul of yet another 50-60 win Spurs team. He’s taken over the Duncan mantle in every way. He’s the best defender in the league and an underrated killer in the clutch. In the end though this MVP race comes down to two players. One a silky smooth old school swag machine with the beard of a wizard. The other a vendetta seeking hell-bent supersonic whirlwind of ass kicking and name taking. 


Harden v. Westbrook		Brodie v. The Beard 		Goatbrook v. El Chapo	


Shall we break it down…


1. The Stats


      SCORING: 	Westbrook is #1 in PPG (31.8). Harden #2 (29.4)
          Westbrook is asked to score more and handle a larger load but he does shoot more. I could see places switched (Harden on OKC, Russ on HOU) Harden could score 32+ppg. That being said Russ and the vendetta he’s on in D’Antoni’s system would be incredible.



      ASSIST:		Harden is #1 (11.3) Westbrook #3 (10.4). 
          So Russ is less than an APG behind Harden and the league lead despite playing the majority of the season with the likes of Singler, Morrow, a rookie Sabonis, Andre “airball freethrows and side of the backboard from the corner” Roberson. The best two offensive players sans Russ are Kanter and Dipo and they’ve missed 10 and 15 games respectively. 
          Compare that to Houston’s 2nd and 3rd best scorers (Gordon & Anderson) and they have combined to only miss 13 games total. 
          Last tidbit each team made additions at the deadline that would benefit the assist #’s for each guy. For OKC it’s been a nice two man game with Taj Gibson and some floor spacing from McBuckets. The Rockets added the odds on favorite for 6MOY Lou Williams. Both additions have helped each team and the MVP case for each guy so I’d say it’s a wash here. 
          For the analytics fans Westbrook is #1 in the NBA in assist % (56) while Harden is #2 (51). Westbrook is a ridiculous ten points higher than #3 John Wall (46).



      BOARDS:	Harden is a fantastic rebounder and is averaging 8 a game. That’s damn good so let’s not get that lost in what Russ is doing. That said the way Russ is rebounding it’s truly historic. Brodie is #12 in the league in RPG (10.5) and #9 in total Rebounds. He has 48 games with 10+ rebounds and 10 games of 15+. 

Russell will become the first player since the Mailman Karl Malone in 1989-90 to average 30ppg and 10rpg. 
                    

The ""uncontested boards argument"": 
          This isn't the first time teams have had their superstar get free throw rebounds. If it really is than it sets a precedent. Rockets, Cavs, Pels, Pacers do it. Get your franchise guys some easy #'s. 
          It's been debated to death but here's my 2 cents... as a guy who's watched 40+ OKC games.... Presti built this team on the fly and Donovan understands the offense is dogshit when they go half court or slow it down. This team is built around Russ. The Stache Bros box out and Russ (don't forget Roberson) crash and that starts the offense. *OKC needs to play fast.* Russ pushes the tempo and strikes fear into opposing fans and backpedaling opponents. This team has zero half court game due to the lack of shooting and ball-handlers. But they have Russ and we've all seen Russ grab a board and we literally hold our breath while he blitzkriegs up court through a 2 on 5 and muscles his way to an and 1 or drops a dime. Russell is without a doubt the most aggressive player in the league and the Thunder know it. They use this knowledge guys. OKC won't win as a half court slow it down team. *It's an entire team running off his intensity and persistence.* That is the best offense the Thunder have and IT WORKS. **It sounds crazy, we're so accustom to the usage rate of mid 00's Kobe and early 00's AI being a negative but sometimes that's what it takes.** Plain and simple. This team was expecting Durant and impromptu built this team to suit Russ and it has worked to a pretty successful degree. 



  TURNOVERS:	 While both are averaging over 5 Turnovers a game (5.4 Westbrook/5.8 Harden) Russ is averaging less while seeing far more double teams and being asked to basically carry the scoring load every night on an Iverson like scale. (Russ leads the NBA with a Usage rate of 41%). Another minor point but still worth noting the Turnovers per 100 possessions or TOV% for Russ is 15.8 but 19.6 for Harden. 
          TLDR: both guys turn it over a bunch but Harden has been historical with the amount of turnovers with less usage and this shouldn’t be forgotten.  



  ADVANCED STATS TIME NERDS! (Here's the link for the STATS) http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2017_leaders.html
                   Look at these top ten list and you'll see the context. Harden is incredible. Westbrook is Historic.


  VORP- Value over Replacement Player
                    Beard has an amazing @ 8.3 but The King of the Prairie is leading the league (10.7). 
         

  BPM- Box Score Plus Minus
                    Simply put this one is similar to the last.
                    Harden is a good deal ahead of the pack but Westbrook is absolutely light years ahead. 


  Win Shares: This one Harden leads the league (14.3) and this is his biggest point in favor of him but Westbrook is fifth with (11.6)

          
  PER: We all know PER, it’s a bit flawed and skewed towards offense. That said Russell again leads the league in this category with a staggering 30.4 (good for 17th all time). Harden is no slouch being tied for 2nd in the league at 27.9 (that would place him in the 60’s all time). 


  The Absurd: So Russ may be the first *player* to average 30ppg and 10rpg sing 1990. You read that right RPG... look at this
          http://i.imgur.com/xgRFmCT.png



2. Efficiency
          Much has been stated about just how efficient Harden has been this year. In my opinion it has been a bit overstated. 
                    His True Shooting is an incredible 62% which is better than Westbrook’s 55% (still nothing to scoff at)
          *Russ has terrible shooting percentages/s....*
                    Sure Russ is shooting 42% but Harden is shooting 44%. And from 3 Russ is shooting 33% and Harden 35%. Given the spacing/shooting and better supporting cast around Harden along with Westbrook’s higher usage rate I’d say this is either a wash or favors Russ. Whether it’s bias or people just looking at box scores the idea that **Russell is a shot jacking low percentage scorer just isn’t the case relative to Harden**. Both guys carry an enormous burden leading their teams as facilitator and primary scorer so it makes sense they wouldn’t be posting Lebron like FG%’s. 



3. Quick Hits
          Neither guy has missed a game this season.
          Both guys are 84% FT shooters. Both are 1 and 2 in attempts (Harden 676 and Westbrook 651)
          Both are top 15 in total steals (Westbrook with 120 or 1.7 SPG and Harden at 111 with 1.5 SPG)



4. Defense
          Harden once a hilarious GIF making machine defensively has shown effort and improved to about average. Westbrook has more tools and came into the league as a defender but his aggressive style and risk taking has rubbed some people the wrong way. That said it’s my opinion Westbrook is a better defender but that’s really the last thing this MVP race is about.
          Quick Stat: Harden is having his best DBPM (1.3) which isn’t anything special but *Russell Westbrook is third in the NBA with  DPM of 4.5.* Higher than Giannis, Drummond, Tony Allen & Anthony Davis.  



5.	The Records
          This is really the big one and the major argument for Harden winning. It is impressive that Houston is going from a 41-41 team to a near 60 win team. But here’s the context… this wasn't a true 41-41 team. The Rockets were embroiled in turmoil in 2015-16. The two previous years they won 56 and 54 games. This was a case of a talented team led by a superstar who underachieved last year amidst a coaching crisis and a much needed change of leadership. This year the Rockets team replaced a mediocre coach Kevin Mchale with an offensive genius who’s scheme is created in a lab for a player exactly like Harden. You couldn’t ask for a player more well suited for D’Antoni’s system (we’ll elaborate on that further down). Houston also swapped out Dwight Howard (http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/outthere/files/2013/08/BHhst.jpg), Corey Brewer (Can't get minutes on a team trying to lose) and Ty Lawson (http://www.holidaywinecellar.com/images/Product/large/20530.jpg) for Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson and Lou Williams. Add in young role players Decker, Harrell and Cappella all being a year more experienced and you can see why this is a 50 win team.
          As for the Thunder they do have some good young players and the idea that it’s Bestbrook and scrubs is idiotic. That doesn’t mean his supporting cast has helped him out all year. To begin the year they had the job of integrating Victor Oladipo as secondary ball handler and the two were playing with a very underwhelming supporting crew aside from the Stash Bros. Just look at this list of names Roberson (A for defense, F for offense), Singler (F for everything including haircut), Cam Payne, Anthony Morrow and the rookies Abrines and Sabonis. This is a shitty cast of misfit broken toys. Since the additions of McDermott and Gibson and the experience under the belt of the rookies this team is 12-6 with wins over the Jazz 2x, Spurs and Raptors. My point is this team isn’t the same team it was to start the year. So while they will likely finish with between 45 and 50 wins they are a better team than that. 
          It isn't an ""on paper argument either""...on paper the Thunder go punch for punch with Houston. Gordon, Lou, Anderson, Ariza, Capella, Harrell v. Oladipo, Adams, Kanter, Gibson, Roberson, Abrines (Still give Houston the upper hand) isn't a landslide but it isn't about fit. All the Rockets guys are shooters, Roll men, D/Board guys who fit perfectly in D'Antoni's system. *The Thunder built this team based on having Kevin Durant.*
                    As of today OKC is the **Second youngest team in the league**.
          Oh and you thought I’d forget about that one thing… This is the big one… **A top 5 NBA player left the Thunder and they started the season with the replacement being Kyle Fucking Singler!** When Servant Cupcake Voldemort left people expected this team to fight tooth and nail just to make the playoffs. Last year’s Western Conference Runner Up won 55 games. This year’s team will win nearly 50!
          If we punish Westbrook for his team only getting the 4-6 seed then why are we propping up the Rockets record/seeding? It isn’t like Harden is carrying his team to 65 wins and the one seed. They’re a high 50’s win team that will finish as the 3 seed. By no means a historic team. We’ll see come playoff time but let’s just say I’m a bit suspicious of D’Antoni’s ability to succeed in the playoffs.  
                    **Stated Plainly: I don’t believe the difference in team records mean jack considering…**
          Both have top ten records in the league & are comfortably in the playoffs.
          OKC had a much worse roster top to bottom for much of the season.
          OKC lost Kevin Fucking Durant and had no replacement to step in (to no fault of their own. You don’t trade a guy like that, you just have to hope he doesn’t fuck you).  




6. Remove the player argument: 
          Almost everyone acknowledges if you take Westbrook off OKC they would be a bottom 10 team. If you remove Harden from HOU they’d likely still be playoff caliber (IMO just behind POR and DEN). 
          Remember fans, writers, gm’s, scouts, pleebs and trolls… this team was built for Durant and potentialy Al Horford (Need sources but word is if Durant resigned OKC would have got Al Horford). Everything they’ve done this year has been on the fly.




7. The D’Antoni Bump:	I don’t see this bandied about too much when people are discussing the MVP race but it’s obvious that Houston’s system gives a statistical bump to the primary ball handler. Let’s call it the “D’Antoni offensive bump”. It isn’t just Nash having his best years with Mike D’Antoni either… 
          Remember when **Kendall Marshall** was an NBA player as the PG in that system? 
          **Nate Robinson** averaged 17ppg as the primary ball handler off the bench! 
          **Chris Duhon** was a starter for the Knicks playing 30+ mpg and post D’Antoni he’s invisible and soon out of the league.
          **Raymond Felton**, while the butt of so many jokes he’s had a solid career but he had BY FAR his best season under D’Antoni. (17ppg/9apg)
          D’Antoni’s first two years he was saddled with **Toney Douglas** (Career avg of 7.6ppg) but off the bench Toney put up both his career highs in ppg (10.6 & 8.6) in just over 20mpg.
          You guys remember Linsanity? Yup D’Antoni’s last year in NYC. **Jeremy Lin** came out of nowhere to set his still career highs in Assist and Points per game. Lin has improved and become a very solid player but it’s tough to imagine Linsanity happening in any other situation.
          Finally this year’s Houston team in regards to this point is a bit of a chicken and egg scenario. Sure Harden is an incredible passer and makes teammates better and it helps secondary players like Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, Clint Capella and Montrezl Harrell. It is also true that the career resurgence for Gordon and Anderson along with big improvements for the young bigs Capella and Harrell is also due in large part to the “D’Antoni Bump”. 
Just look at the track record and it becomes obvious this system helps players statistically. 


8. Clutch
          In “Clutch Time” Russell (48) has a higher EFG% than Harden (43). 
          It’s obvious to us fans and more so to coaches who’s taking shots late game and Russell has a mind numbing 60% usage rate in the clutch and yet still sits atop the leaderboard for nearly every clutch statistic there is. 
          In games that go to “clutch time” OKC is 23-14. HOU is 20-15.
          Russell has a 38 PEI compared to Hardens 24. (Help me out here sub I don’t know exactly what NBA.com quantifies PEI as but Russ is WAY ahead…)
          In case you thought Russ took every shot in crunch time and is a ball hog to the detriment of his team well…. he has a higher Ast% than Harden in the clutch (53% to 41%)
          Russ has 425 points in the final five minutes of the fourth quarter this season. Most in 20 years. 
                     https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/847282893370015744
         You’ve seen it time and time again. Celtics fans you know (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNEoPpUg0W0). How about that Jazz game (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiiiTPj7Pwg) just after the all-star break? Most recently Russ scored 14 of the last 16 and single handedly led OKC on a 14 point comeback with less than 4 minutes to play in Dallas. And his most recent game… down 14 less than 3 minutes left… just AND 1’S and 3’s over and over. Great passing too. Dipo has been hitting those clutch dimes. This again happened on the road in Orlando and if you didn't know any better you'd think it was @ the Peak (in OKC). More than a few times Russ has received huge cheers and MVP chants on the road. You all see the games and if not you need to enlighten yourselves and check FreeDawkins and Ximo Pietro and the like on Youtube. This man is committing felony arson in the 4th quarters. 
          A small bit of Evidence: https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/622p98/russell_clutch_shot_compilation/




9. The Eye Test/Wow Factor
          This admittedly is more subjective than most the points I’ve made. It’s a bit of a Bill Simmons type of reasoning but when we look back 10-20 years from now at this season and ask what’s the biggest story line it won’t be Harden’s consistently fantastic numbers. It won’t be Kawhi’s defense. Nor LeBron’s still incredible all-around game. It’s Westbeast’s tour of destruction. 
          Westbrook is the biggest ticket in the league this year. (Brooklyn, Orlando and a few other fans are outright cheering MVP at home for a road player… that’s Jordan level respect). 
          Russell is the most explosive, fun to watch, makes the other teams fans cheer, spectacle in the NBA.  The weirdest thing about this year is how desensitized we’ve become due to Russell’s eye popping #’s and seemingly nightly triple doubles. 
          This fucking guy is going to average a Triple Double! lol it’s incomprehensible. 
          This regular season will be remembered as “the year Durant left OKC and Westbrook went Nuclear”.  


10. Storylines Matter:	They really shouldn’t so much but we’re all human and we love a good story. What’s a better story?
          James Harden lifts a talented Rockets team with a fantastic offensive coach to an impressive but ultimately flavor of the month 55+ wins. 
          Russell Westbrook goes supernova and carries a franchise… no city… nay region from the depths of despair after being dumped by the franchise’s greatest icon/player for their mortal enemy and team they just lost to on the grandest of stages. (You get the point)
                    I am biased as an OKC fan but try to put yourself in the position of one of us. You lose your franchise/city most beloved player ever. It’s in the worst possible way and his maligned sidekick takes the reigns and does this shit… **It isn’t just the numbers or wins people**.


11. Triple Doubles
          Let’s lead this off with the fact that James Harden has 19 triple doubles this season. Harden is absolutely killing it. He had 9 in his career before this season. Some context for you… Kobe, Kareem, Webber, Barkley, Baylor, Jordan and G. Hill all had individually less than 30 for their entire careers. 

     Russell Westbrook has 38 triple doubles this season. *That alone would put him 9th on the All Time Career Triple Doubles list*. **He’s three behind Oscar Robertson for most in a season with 8 games left. ** He’s likely going to have the most Trip Dubs in a season. 

     How about getting the only ""perfect"" triple double in history and the highest scoring triple double. Seems like a minor point but still historic feats.

     

     Alvin Robertson leading the league in Assist and Scoring is mythic. Westbrook will finish this season leading the league in PPG with a 30pt triple double and top 3 in assists while leading the league in scoring. 

    https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/378800000697945639/a7eeae038851851a2b0507cca1917b04.jpeg



    We all know this hasn’t been done in 55 years, only once in the history of the league and Russell is doing it in a slower era (close to 20 less possessions per game). 
    The sneaky best stat about this: **Russell is averaging this triple double in 10 minutes less per game than the Big O did**. Wednesday’s overtime comeback vs Orlando was the first time Russ has played 40+ mins since November. Hearing shit like that gets me to shake and tremble in utter confusion like a mid-rant Lewis Black. 
          People will try to discredit this stat (I honestly don't know why other than they're contrarian's or fucktards... I digress...) but seriously if this was *""so easy""* IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BY NOW. 




12.	Perspective
          It’s really like a legendary cocktail of past fabled performances…


1. The way his team depends on him, opponents focus on him, his usage and unyielding will is reminiscent of Prime Allen Iverson.
2. This may be the greatest rebounding season for a PG ever. A rich man’s Jason Kidd.
3. He has the scoring and ability to get to any spot on the floor like Young Michael Jordan.
4. He’s showcasing the passing and unselfishness of a Showtime Magic Johnson. (Hyperbolic... maybe but those role guys he's working with... Put him on Houston and he's got 2+APG)
5. His athletic dominance and stamina over his peers rivals ABA Julius Erving, 80’s ‘Nique, 80's MJ, Elign Baylor or Big O. 
6. The intensity and effort is on a Garnett/Kobe/MJ level. 



I’ll end this by asking… What does the MVP mean to you? 



We all have varying definitions and weigh the factors differently. Is it simply “Who is the best player in the league this year”? How about “Most important player”? Best player on the Best team? 


It’s certainly complicated and both Westbrook and Harden are deserving but…
    Firstly the argument (heard Simmons say it and I grinded my teeth to dust hearing it) it can only be a player on a championship contender is frankly idiotic. *There can be outliers.* This award isn’t best player on the best team. It could be argued and has been a thousand times it’s a best player on a top 3 seed but if the Thunder were in the Eastern Conference they’d be right there as a top 3 seed. Seems to me (pardon the pun) a B.S. argument.


If we ask who’s the best player in the league this year the answer is Westbrook. 


1st in PPG, VORP, BPM, OBPM, PER, AST%. 
2nd in FTA, FTM. 
3rd in DBPM, ASSIST & APG.  
5th in Win Shares and 12th in Rpg and 9th in total Rebounds. 
He’s been the most clutch player in the league. 
He’s carried a below average roster every single game to well above expectations.
He’s setting records left and right that may** literally never be broken**.


If the question is literally who’s the Most Valuable player to their given team it is close but again both candidates removed, one team would be borderline playoffs and the other a team in the lowest tier of the league. I believe value to a team and franchise is more than that though. We have to think about the story lines. What they mean to their team and city beyond just the box scores. 
     Russell Westbrook has galvanized an entire region. Inspired a generation of kids to play balls out giving maximum effort while still being a good teammate and leading by example. He’s showing the old timers that a 30 point triple double for a season was possible again. Harden is a fan favorite having a historical season and by no means is any of what I’ve stated meant to denigrate him. That said…
     No matter how we argue this… Russ is the MVP. 
a.	Russ wins the Analytics argument 
b.	Russ wins the “Storyline” argument
c.	Russ is objectively the most clutch and dominant player in the league.
d.	All due respect to the Beard but other than his team being 7-8 wins better he doesn’t have a leg to stand on.


As a diehard OKC fan my opinions may seem blunt. I have loved Harden since ASU. He’s FUCKING AMAZING GUYS. I welcome debate and think it’s healthy for the sub, the league and fandom in general. I’ve made my points and…
          

I humbly believe this is Russell Westbrook’s season. He is the Most Valuable Player however you want to slice it. This performance by Westbrook is truly a once in a lifetime experience. A season for the ages.

"It needs to be said, because Russ and the Thunder did just about the impossible. Plus, they say the NBA is about drama. My god, that was like something scripted out of a movie. 

I'm sitting there with 3 minutes left in the 4th thinking OK, this is one is over. No way in hell the Thunder come back. But they managed to play the final minutes to perfection. It's probably safe to say Dallas also had a complete meltdown, which OKC took advantage of.

Even with the comeback, it looked like they didn't stand a chance of winning, then Berea turned the ball over. Now it came down to one shot, and [Russ nailed it](https://streamable.com/ftkm1). 

Throw another triple double on top of that.

"Hi all. I live a few hours from OKC and I have never bought NBA tickets before. I know this sounds like a really stupid question but I was just wondering the best way to do this? My best friend and I LOVE Westbrook and he is my all time favorite player. I feel like I will regret not choosing to see him play in person with this historic season.

I know it may seem obvious how to buy tickets because I googled and saw there are many websites selling tickets. However, I want to know what you all think is the best website and the most trustworthy source. I have heard bad things about Stubhub and I'm nervous buying from Craiglist. Is an online site the best for getting two tickets? This would be for next Tues game against the Bucks. Or would it be better to call the stadium and buy over the phone?

Thank you all for the help. I am excited to see the future MVP in action!","I've never bought NBA tickets before and I want to see my fav player Westbrook before the season ends. Help? Hi all.

"Everyone keeps saying the same thing when they debate Russ and James for MVP. Both guys are putting up big numbers. But they always say well the Thunder just don't have a good enough record. 

This is why I hate that argument: 
Last season OKC had a record of 55-27.
FiveThirtyEight calculated Kevin Durant to have 14.1 wins over replacement for that season.
Now look at how the team has changed from that season to this season.
Kevin Durant leaves in free agency.
Ibaka is traded for Oladipo and Sabonis 
Im going to count the Ibaka trade as a net even which is being generous when you consider that you have to work two new STARTERS into the system.
Now we will address KD. Simply take away 14 wins from that season, again this is being generous considering he was the best player on the team and without him Russ draws much more defensive attention. Not to mention how the offense had to change without him on the team.
This would give the OKC thunder a roughly equivalent record of 41-41.
Oh but wait the Thunder have a record of 41-31 with 10 games still to be played!!!!

Now my other soap box belief. When you hear actual former players talk about why Westbrook should be the MVP their reasoning isn't wow triple double season, its that to do that you have to go out and grind every time you step out on the court for 82 fucking games. This takes an immense amount of effort and psychological strength. These media jokers cant keep a workout schedule for 4 weeks. This guy runs through a brick wall every single night.

*Not sure if my stats argument actually holds up but this should be out there.

"I hope we never trade Kanter, but while watching last game I realized how well he would fit to the Rockets system.

- With a team as stretched as rockets, Kanter easily can post up anyone.

"Taj Gibson, Andre Roberson, Nick Collison, and Norris Cole will all be free agents next year. Nick Collison will retire and I doubt we'll re-sign Cole. That leaves us with Taj Gibson, Andre Roberson, and almost no money.

We can't sign an all-star, we all know that. We can re-sign Taj Gibson but if somebody offers Roberson a high salary I think we'll have to let him go. 

We have the second youngest team in the NBA that have a good future and they have a lot of room for improvement. But I don't understand why some of you guys say we can't contend for a championship now but will be able to next year. Personally, if we can't compete for a championship now, I don't think we'll be able to make drastic changes in the offseason so that we'll be contenders next year. 

Sure we'll draft somebody, but that wouldn't make us instant contenders. So I feel like our roster will look pretty much the same except we won't have Taj or Roberson. And they'll be replaced by a different role player.

Maybe we can pull off a trade but again, I don't see how that will make us instant contenders.

"So I've been a long time lurker of this sub having loved the Thunder since they've made their move to my hometown in OKC. I decided to join the military about 3 years ago to give my wife and kids a bit of a better life than we were living down here. It's a long story that I don't want to get in to. Since I've joined we've been stationed in Fort Benning, GA for the last 2 years and thanks to league pass,  we haven't missed but 5 games (thanks to field problems). But, this week, we came to town for some personal issues we had to take care of, and on top of that it's our anniversary week. I decided to buy some tickets for tonight's game to surprise my wife,  and I can't wait to finally see a game in person again. It's kind of a special thing for us considering I took her to a Thunder game for our first date, and I still remember it was against the T Wolves and it was Kevin Martin's first time back in OKC since he left. We were down the entire game until the 4th where Russ and Cupcake made a ridiculous 4th quarter comeback.

"While watching the game I noticed a few things:
This is the best we have looked against golden state despite the score. 
We showed we can play solid defence and are capable of making plays and passing the ball around. We really fell out of the game when we went on a really shitty run in the 2nd quarter when everyone was making rushed shot choices, not going for rebounds and just giving golden state the ball.  Golden state got their lead and most of their points not by their defense but rather our mistakes. 

Which with a group like this, I think those mistakes really can be smoothed out and make us a solid playoff darkhorse. 

Again after that series of bad choices, bad shots etc in the 2nd quarter, we never really were able to comeback.

"Yeah we lost the game but so what? We played poorly. It happens. We can't really blame a certain player. Our defense was horrible. So many open 3's from them. WB and Abrines combined for 1-13 from the 3. And we all know that Abrines always shoots good. It was just an off-night for him.

Roberson was bad on defense today. My guess was he was going to lock down Klay and Westbrook would double team Curry with Dipo. Taj and Adams would defend the paint. But that just didn't work out.

Rebounding. Holy shit. That was the worst rebounding effort we have ever put. Kanter is the only one that was able to rebound. And I just have no clue why Adams breaks down against good teams.

Most importantly, Westbrook seemed to be off. If you look at his stats on Mondays, those are usually his worst. He just couldn't get his shots to go in.

Long story short, this game would have been a lot better if Abrines and WB would have knocked out at least 4 more threes to go 5-13. And if we wouldn't have let them take so many open 3's.

"For those of you old enough to remember, go back to 1998. 

Ask yourself, who hit the most homeruns in a single season of MLB? It's fairly obvious to most people who lived through that time as a sports fan that Mark McGwire set the new single-season homerun record. 

Now ask yourself, who was MVP that year? Better yet, who won the World Series that year?

Unless you're a diehard MLB fan, you probably don't know. But you certainly can rattle off the name ""Mark McGwire"" when people say homeruns. 

The point is don't get worked up about the MVP race and votes. All that is at this point is a cherry on top of the cake that Russ baked and his teammates iced.

History is already being made, and no award big or small can change that at this point.

And let's say they give the MVP to someone other than Russ. Will people in 20 years be sitting around remembering the time that (insert other player) got the award? Or will they be talking about that one time Russ did something no other player has done since 1962?

"A couple weeks ago it seemed like we might limp our way to the end of the regular season barely over .500. Now after 5 straight wins, the Thunder are 40-29 with 13 games remaining. 

These include 2 likely losses (Warriors and Spurs), 3 even matchups with playoff teams (Rockets, Grizzlies, Bucks), and 8 games against sub-.500 opponents. My question for you guys is do you think 50 wins is doable?? Meaning we'd have to close out the season at 10-3. 15-3 counting the games we've already won.

Seems insane to even think about it as that was pretty much the best case scenario in the pre-season, but I think its a realistic goal. Obviously it will also help that we'll be playing a KD-less GSW and a crippled (albeit still good) Spurs team.

If we can hit 50 and lock up the 4 or 5 seed I think it not only gives Russ a better than 50% shot at MVP, but might be enough to convince him that this team is close to contention and he should re-up with us this offseason.","Will we hit 50 wins??

It's only been about 10 days since Mark Cuban trashed Russell Westbrook as a non-legit MVP candidate -- repeating his ""gotta win 50,"" etc. mantra before his team went out and beat an injured Thunder squad in Dallas.

( http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18832985/dallas-mavericks-owner-mark-cuban-says-russell-westbrook-oklahoma-city-thunder-not-mvp-candidate ) 

At the time, it was a facile jab.  The Thunder were in the midst of a 4-game skid without a healthy Victor Oladipo, who returned for the next game against Portland and one more OKC loss.

Since then, however, Oladipo is back, and healthy, and the Thunder have beaten Utah, Toronto, Brooklyn (all right, Brooklyn), and San Antonio....  

They're just a game behind the Clippers, and have a decent shot of catching Utah for the division and the #4 seed.

Cuban may have inadvertantly set off a bit of a Thunder storm with those remarks -- motivating both RW, and the team, to be the winner they can...  both for the MVP race, and the more important playoff run they may have in them.

Russell Westbrook?  With extra motivation?

"And I hate that mythical 9.9 number. Harden isn't averaging 9.9 rebounds. Yes 9.9 and 10 are very close. 7.9 and 10.6 are not close.

If we wanna talk close numbers their assists are way closer. 10.3 to 11.2. And if you watch both teams you'll see why it's crazy that Westbrook is averaging 1 assist less than harden when their teams are completely different. Harden has a team of shooters and a system that helps him tremendously. Westbrook has a team of slashers and dunkers and no shooters that holds his numbers back significantly. 

I'm not saying harden isn't an amazing player. But if we're gonna compare stats take them for what they are. Don't inflate the stats to make harden seem closer.

29.1/7.9/11.2 vs 31.8/10.6/10.3

Now of course stats aren't everything so you go to the eye test to get context. Just look at the rockets shot chart. It's insane. Amazing system in Houston that really benefits harden. Compared to no system in OKC. 

Harden has a shitload of great 3 pt shooters around him that make it easy for him to drive and dish and get the assist.

Westbrook has a bunch of slashers and postup big men that completely clog the paint so Westbrook can't just drive and dish. Teams don't even guard some of our perimeter players they are so bad at shooting from 3.

This accounts for their difference in wins and westbrook's drop in shooting %, overall shot selection, forced 3's, and westbrook's lower assist numbers.

Shooting % - when the entire defense is stacked in the paint Westbrook has very few options to score. He can either drive in and attempt a crazy layup (not a high % shot), drive in and shoot a quick pull up 2 (not a high % shot), drive and dish (our team is 3rd worst in 3 pt shooting), pass it to a big man and hope they can score off a post up (relied on so much that teams start to double team our bigs and force turnovers or force a pass for a 3 which like I said we're terrible at), or take the 3 himself to try to create spacing (he's not a great 3 pt shooter). Westbrook's best when he can drive to the bucket and beat his man for a layup, or when he can drive and dish. Both of those things suffer when you have no spacing, because huge guys are sitting in the paint waiting for you. We also don't have bigs who can shoot the 3 like many teams do today. So again, creates even less spacing and more of a logjam in the paint. What he's working with is insane. We don't have a bad team, we just don't have a team built around what Westbrook needs. So a lot of times it looks like he's forcing it or taking bad shots. Occasionally I agree. But most of the time it's because he has no spacing on his team. If you notice his best games come when our guys start hitting the 3 early. This solves the majority of those problems, but our guys aren't good three point shooters so those games are few and far between. Meaning he has to try to continue force shots and take 3's to open the floor up, which is not an efficient way to score.

Shot selection - see above

Forced 3's - see above

Lower assist numbers - this should be obvious between the two. They are only averaging a difference of 1 assist per game. We've had tons of games where we miss open 3 after open 3 after ope 3. The fact that Westbrook is averaging over 10 assists with a team that sucks at shooting it's crazy enough on its own, moreso that he's second in the league and only behind the leader (who's guys do consistently hit open shots) by 1.

Wins - almost every game we've had this season has come down to the last minute or so of play. Other than just a few games every game has been close and winnable. Guys missing open shots is why the scores are always so close and if Westbrook had shooters around him who could make wide open shots is the difference between where we are now and being in the 3 seed. For example, Houston's margin of victory is 6.84. Ours is 0.30. Very close games. And easily winnable if one guy makes one extra wide open shot, like the rockets consistently do. Also in these situations when guys keep missing, Westbrook is forced into trying to do it all on his own.
More often than not, he does. But he can't do it every game, even when he scores the last 19 points for our team. Sometimes it's not enough and oftentimes he's forced into bad shot selection for the reasons listed above. It's a good strategy for other teams, it works against us bc we don't have shooters around him. But the fact that we're one game back from the 5 seed says a lot about how great Westbrook is.

Assist totals - again for all the reasons above. But the main point is harden has shooters around him and Westbrook does not. 

So in my opinion if you're picking the most valuable player, it's dumb to imagine they are the same on the same teams and houston's record is solely because of harden. If we had shooters like they did, our team records would be much closer and that argument would be invalidated. So personally I don't think you can use team wins in this argument simply bc harden's team is built around him so much better than westbrook's and therefore it his team doing better than westbrook's, not harden doing better than Westbrook.

All that being said I'm not going to be mad if harden wins MVP. He deserves it, I just think Westbrook deserves it more.","I posted this comment on an r/NBA sub.

"They're just that good from the 3. Pretty much every player on their team can shoot from 3. Their bench with Lou Williams and Eric Gordon is insane as well. I just don't see us beating them.

UTah has CLE and DET back to back which puts Oklahoma city inn a good position because Utah might loose both but for any hope OKC HAS to beat Toronto to take pressure off of this upcoming warriors game.

"Kinda a shit post - I know this is A typical, but Dougie needs to learn how to be a set shooter. He's too preoccupied with other shit. 3 and D. That's all we need. In today's NBA people generally try and develop all facets of their game. Off the dribble. Defense. Slashing. Shooting. Everything. We just need Doug to hit knock down 3s. That's all. If he can be a reliable 3 point shooter for us it would be invaluable. Korver and McD went to the same college. McD should see if he can get some practice time with Korver over the summer. I played with Korver once or twice (I'm from Omaha), and I've never seen anyone with a quicker and more accurate release. Korver has lk 2 or 3 years left. He should try and pass the torch of the proud Creighton program. ","McNuggets and Korver Kinda a shit post - I know this is A typical, but Dougie needs to learn how to be a set shooter.

"This may be an unpopular opinion but I think it's true. Let's break this down:

Starting in the backcourt we have Curry and Thompson vs Westbrook and Oladipo. Westbrook and Oladipo are averaging more points, assists, and rebounds per game. Well Westbrook averages more assists and rebounds than Curry and Thompson combined. And with the addition of Oladipo it isn't even close.

Now I think most of the people will agree that Westbrook is better than Curry. But the match-up between Oladipo and Thompson can get a bit tricky. Thompson has the height advantage on Oladipo and is obviously better from the 3.

But Thompson can't drive towards the hoop like Oladipo. On top of that, Oladipo has a much better hustle and is much more athletic. 

Now here is what people seem to forget: Thunder has a really nice front-court. Taj Gibson and Steven Adams going against Draymond Green and Zaza Pachulia. Draymond is a great defensive player but he can't really grab offensive rebounds. Especially if he's matched up against a veteran like Taj. Adams would dominate Zaza, nothing to add.

Another thing to add is Andre Roberson. With Durant out, Warriors will be playing McCaw at SF. This will allow Roberson to guard a player like Curry or Thomspon. My guess is he'll guard Thompson.

This leaves us with the bench. Warriors don't have a nice bench. They have Andre Iguodala and Javale McGee that can pose a threat from the bench. But we also have Kanter and a couple shooters and I think that will also be evenly matched.","Thunder and Warriors are evenly matched without Durant This may be an unpopular opinion but I think it's true.

This is bullshit, he's stat padding. Steals rebounds from his teammates. There's no way he will get MVP with those turnovers... we'll ignoring Harden, that's still a lot. He needs to pass more...

"I was thinking of how Thunder should run their offense and it seems like I just found a solid rotation.

PG - Russ
SG - Dipo
SF - McDermott
PF - Grant
C - Adams

This is McDermott's shooting chart for this season: http://on.nba.com/2lCMhmA

And this is Oladipo's: http://on.nba.com/2mhMk4m

Notice anything? They complement each other. McDermott is good from the left wing and left corner but is horrible from the right. Oladipo is pretty much the opposite. By running this offense, we can have McDermott on the left and Dipo on the right. Which helps spread the floor for WB. Allowing him to do a pick-and-roll or to dish out to his two shooters.

Grant, believe it or not, is our best shot-blocker. By playing him instead of Kanter or Gibson, we may lose out on offensive rebounds, but our defense in the paint will be better.

"I still had hope for this team after their 3 game losing streak on the road. I thought that they are just bad on the road. Something wasn't clicking. But now I know how our team really plays.

Donovan doesn't know how to utilize shooters, Abrines can't play defense, McDermott has been horrible so far, and WB doesn't trust his teammates. 

Before this game started, I was excited for it. You know, we finally get to see how our healthy team plays. Well we did, and it was bad. Oladipo went 5/9 from the field and 4/5 from the 3. But WB couldn't pass to him more often. Adams had only one shot opportunity and Kanter only had 6. But made 5. Westbrook shot more 3's than any other player shot field goals. With the exception of Oladipo who shot 9 field goals. Which was the same number of attempted 3's by WB.

Westbrook has poor shot selection. Even some of the shots he makes are pretty reckless. He just shoots a mid-range jumpshot when there is no one there to get the offensive rebound. 

Westbrook won't be averaging a triple-double for the season, he won't beat Oscar Robertson's record, and Thunder will not get the 4th seed. Hell I'm not even sure they'll keep the 7th. Best case scenario is we get one win in the playoffs. 

And maybe the reason why no one stood up for WB when ZaZa pushed him was because he doesn't trust his teammates. So in return, his teammates don't trust him.

Now I know that I'll watch them play against the Spurs, but I know we are going to lose. Westbrook will go 17-36 and have like 6 TO's. Everyone else will have like 4 points. The ones who played good might have 8. 

I'm just very frustrated with this team because WB doesn't even pass to the young guys or new guys to help them develop.

"First things first, I have to give congratulations to Dirk. He's now scored 30,000 career points, the sixth player in NBA history to do so. Now, what you've been waiting for. Another loss. That's now four losses in a row for us. I was able to start watching the game in the second quarter, and here is what I was able to see.

1. Oladipo was solid in his return. He was able to chip in 16 points on 5/9 shooting, 4/5 from deep, all while playing very solid defense. Having him back on the court once again was for sure a welcome sight.

2. We shot 51% on the night! We shot very well tonight from all over the court. The team also shot 40% from deep. After a 40 point explosion in the first quarter, we eventually did slow down.

3. Russell Westbrook is a beast. The man is insane. What he's able to do is insane. Tonight he had 58 points on 21-39 shooting. However, , he has been unable to hit the big shot that we've needed. However, other people need to be able to score the ball in order for us to win.

4. Steven Adams struggled a lot. Steven really struggled against the pick and roll tonight, and this is a common trend I've been noticing recently. On more then one occasion the Blazers bigs were able to get a wide open shot outside due to poor positioning on his part from deep. He also once again struggled to guard Nurkic.

5. We struggled on defense a lot. Due to the Blazers movement off ball and the fact that they can really stretch the ball, we got exposed. They were able to shoot 55% on the night in an even scoring attack. The only two people who I can comfortably say played solid defense for most of the night has to be Oladipo and Roberson. This is unfortunate and definitely a problem that we need to address going forward. It is very difficult to win games when teams are scoring above 100.

6. Officiating was awful both ways. Two questionable fouls on Roberson, questionable fouls going our way, as well as against us, and inconsistent officiating plagued the whole night. While it didn't cause us to lose the game by any means, it clearly was a frustration to both sides.

7. That Oladipo play at the end of the game was a beautiful play call by our coaching staff. The Blazers expected Westbrook to shoot it, leading to a wide open three off the screen for Oladipo.

I am concerned about our defense and defensive rebounding. They didn't miss much, but when they did they were able to get offensive rebounds fairly early. We have now lost four straight games in which Russell has scored 45 points or more. I can't help but feel as if he's tiring himself out. In some scenarios, I agree, you're feeling it, no one else is hitting, go ahead. Tonight, however, that wasn't the case. The team was hitting very well tonight. As much as I love him scoring at this high of a pace, I think we have gotten to the point where it might be starting to hurt the team. See you all next time.

"So I've been following Russ's season closely since near the start -  once-in-a-generation stats are something that interest me.  My first thought is that Westbrook doesn't actually even need to average a triple double anymore.  He's so far ahead in rebounds and points that he only needs to average 8.2 rebounds and 10 assists per game.

The second thing is more of a question.  Early in the season, like game 7 or so, he fouled out early (which makes his current stat line even more impressive if you ask me) which dented his stats a bit.  But if he misses an entire game, will that missed game count as a 0-0-0 for the season?  Or would we calculate over 81 games rather than 82?

I just ask because he's on 14 technicals now, which puts him on track to hit 16 before the end of the season.","Some thoughts on Westbrooks Triple Double season So I've been following Russ's season closely since near the start -  once-in-a-generation stats are something that interest me.

I think the match up with the rockets would be alright (6 seed) or against the Jazz (5 seed) if we get 5th seed (unlikely) we have gsw 2nd round or if we get (6 seed) we have spurs 2nd round both very hard teams to beat.

"Multiple articles say he has participated in light practices on Monday and ran plays with Cole, McDermott, and Taj. He shot afterwards and said he felt good. But Donovan said he will know for sure after tomorrow's shootaround.

I really hope he comes back. Without him, our rotation is messy. And with Abrines's poor defense and him always committing fouls, we all know he can't play for long.

"Final score was 104-89, but it wasn't that close. Russ got a tech and a flagrant, I punched a chair(didn't break anything), Abrines got poked in the eye, Oladipo had a bad back, and our losing streak got longer. Well, let's get into my observations.

1. Can't spell OKC with D. Originally, this post was going to be me commenting on how Roberson and Abrines were doing a less then stellar job defensively. Then, I noticed Westbrook was, and McDermott, and Sabonis. They were shooting above 50%. By  the end of the night, they cooled off, and only shot to the tune of 48.8% from the field. We did rotate very well though, on defense. But we were rotating every single possession because we were not only jumping on literally any movement that could be considered a shot fake, but constantly were beat off the dribble, and got killed on the pick and pop.

2. We played well inside. We had a very, very solid half inside. 38 points from the paint in the first half is overall a solid half, even with Kanter starting poorly. This put us in a decent position, as we were only down by 10 at half, and they were hitting everything.

3. If it ain't broke don't fix it. Well, it broke, and we couldn't fix it. They sagged in on defense to completely take away the paint in the second half. Good on them. Due to our inability to hit anything from deep(2-22), they had no reason to even defend us from out around the arc.

4. Kyle Singler's bun looks like a docked dog tail.

5. It wasn't all negative. It mostly was. The lone bright spots really were Russ scoring, Steven Adams, and Enes Kanter. Adams and Kanter were able to have great offensive games, however they both really struggled to defend their assignments, as most of the time they were able to shoot from outside. Semaj also played some solid defensive minutes as well.

Best wishes to Abrines. Hopefully his injury isn't too bad. I hope Oladipo comes back soon as well. We need him. This game is concerning to me. It exposed several problems our team has. The main problems I think of are

1. Defending Stretch Forwards/Centers
2. Perimeter Defense
3. Generic offense.

Our bigs really struggle with defending anyone who can expand outside to the perimeter. While i love them to death, this creates some very unfavorable matchups for us.

Our guards have really struggled to defend at all on the perimeter during our losing streak, causing our whole defense to really struggle. Oladipo's return should really help this.

Our offense in general can be very inconsistent. If Russell doesn't hit, who does? Oladipo should help with this as well.

Overall, we're going to be alright. I still hold the belief that we'll end the season on a high note of some sort. I trust in this team and coaching staff to get us going in the right direction.

"So I didn't watch the Sun's game. But I did check the box score. From what I can see, WB hard carried. 14/30 is 46% fg. Technically it's pretty efficient overall. Beasted on rebounds and did pretty good on assists. And surprisingly, not a severely high number of turnovers. I mean it's still kinda high, but not like 6-7. 3's weren't falling for him though, 25% on that. But I'm no here to complain about his 3's.

I am here to challenge my previous statement that he shot well simply because it was a 46 fg%. Typically that's pretty good, but I think the volume of taken and missed makes a difference. The game doesn't give a shit about your percentages. It gives a shit about flat scores. So humor me a bit and let's consider the situations where instead of misses, he gave the ball to his teammates and have them score it and let's say for the sake of being contrived they score a regular field goal.

Scenario 1: 
* WB made 14/30 at 46 fg% meaning he missed 16 shots
* if instead of taking those 16 shots he gave it to his team and they made them all at 100%, that is 32 points they could of had
* if instead of taking those 16 shots he gave it to his team and they made them all at 50%, that is 16 points they could of had
* if instead of taking those 16 shots he gave it to his team and they made them all at 25%, that is 8 points they could of had

Scenario 2:
* WB made 7/15 at 46 fg% meaning he missed 8 shots
* if instead of taking those 8 shots he gave it to his team and they made them all at 100%, that is 16 points they could of had
* if instead of taking those 8 shots he gave it to his team and they made them all at 50%, that is 8 points they could of had
* if instead of taking those 8 shots he gave it to his team and they made them all at 25%, that is 4 points they could of had

So to me, there is a lot that can be learned from this. For one thing, we lost the game by 7 points. We only needed the other guys outside of WB to shoot 25% and we would of had the game. To me, shots at a higher volume need to have a higher fg% otherwise, all those misses are points given up. In scenario 1, if the rest of the team is complete garbage and shoots at only 25%, that's still the same amount of points lost when the rest of the team is shooting at 50% in scenario 2. In otherwords, in scenario 1, even thought WB has a worst offensive team than scenario 2, because he didn't give the ball to them, he still loses out on the same amount of points. My point is this. I think WB should tone down on the shots and the rest of the team needs to score more. Because even thought his fg% is good, he's losing a lot of shots on his own.

I know these scenarios are contrived. He didn't go 14/14 then went 0/16 afterwards. High volume scoring in WB's case also leads to high volume misses. I'm not going to say WB needs to get his team involved more. He's already doing that. The problem is trusting them to score more and maybe instead of just having WB do his magic and set people up, actually come up with an offensive system that gets our guys easy buckets. I know it's been said before, but it's true. I also recognize thy at the game's lose isn't solely on offensive. In fact the score is actually pretty good, but like always we have defensive woes. And I do recognize that as a big issue in that game.

"Something a lot of people might not be considering RE: these two losses in a row is that we haven't been very good at all on the road this season (12-19 vs 23-8 at home). We haven't played a road game since we played the Wizards BEFORE the ASB. So, relativity speaking, it's been a long time since we've played on the road, so there's going to be a bit of rust. Plus Portland and Phoenix played extremely hard. I'm not saying that we should've expected them to preform bad—we should've won both those games if we had a bit more consistency and played better defense—I'm just saying it's about par for the course for us this season. And our par is still better than most teams bests. 


Plus, silver-lining, this has been a trail-by-fire of sorts for Abrines, Gibson, and McDermott. With Dipo out they've been getting a lot of extra minutes and are adapting to our style quickly, plus Abrines is getting some valuable starter experience. Crazy to think he's just a rookie.


Anyways, said all that to say that the sky's not falling because we lost two games in a row. Once we get Dipo back and he's knocked a bit of rust off (if anybody says we should start Abrines over him after his first game back I'm gonna kick you (softly) because he's going to have rust. It's been almost a month since he's played last and hasn't practiced a lot with his injury.)


With that, I'm looking forward to tomorrows game. It'll be a tough one since the Mavs are a little hot right now, plus their defense is even more dangerous now that they've got Noel. Seriously, Dallas is my hometown team so I've watched a bunch of their games this year, and their defense is severely underrated. 

It's going to be a good one. I'll see ya in the game thread.","One thing about these losses...

"Just a little rant,

I was looking on okc's Facebook page and there are so many knee jerk ignorant fans out there. They were saying we should trade Adams in the off season and stuff https://imgur.com/a/7NwMc

Idk if they are just not educated about OKC or its just me, but I think Adams has been essential to us being such an elite offensive rebounding team and decent defensive team the way he organises us there.

He has been playing pretty terrible the last 2 games OFFENSIVELEY (he's been very good defensively imo) but it's just annoying to see these people say trade him after 2 bad games where he has been good this entire season he also played against an elite defending center Gobert where even kanter struggled. Obviously if he continues to play bad offensively there can be no excuses but hopefully he can bounce back against the Suns tomorrow!!

"So much went on in this game. Adams had an off-night today. In fact, it seemed like the whole team, with the exception of a few players, had an off-night today. We also had Oladipo out. Fourth quarter was a disaster not only for Westbrook, but for the whole team. It seemed like he was forced to shoot since no one else was making it.

But look on the bright side, even on our off day we put up a fight. Even though Westbrook didn't come up clutch in the 4th, he still scored 45 points. Oladipo hasn't played after the all-star break but we are 3-1 after the break. And we are still only 2 games behind from the 4th seed. 

Norris Cole only played 11 minutes but he was great. Made a 3 and got a couple assists. Played solid defense as well. Was able to get a steal and didn't get a single turnover. Before the game and throughout the game, he was just happy to be there.

Plus this was an away game against a solid team. When Oladipo comes back we will finally have our whole team and we will look so nice. And I feel like once we get him back we will have the best bench in the NBA. Or at least top 3. Cole, Abrines, McDermott, Gibson, and Kanter.","It's only one game... So much went on in this game.

"Tough loss tonight. No matter how well we did Portland always had an answer, and that fourth quarter killed us (and almost me). Let's get into my observations.

1. Alex Abrines hit a wall. Shooting 2-3 with 6 points in 10 minutes is a wall? Well, no. This is one of those things you had to watch the game to realize. There was a point in the third quarter where his man scored four straight baskets. He was constantly exposed on defense, which lead to his five fouls. However, this is not the start of the bench Abrines campaign. He provides a lot for us and just simply came back down to earth tonight.

2. Steven Adams struggled. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but I felt as if he was just struggling to guard some of Portland's players tonight. Portland did a very effective job at boxing him out and creating great offensive match-ups against him, such as Aminu on the perimeter. 

3. Roberson was incredible. Roberson played lockdown defense for just about the whole night. He stuck to whoever he guarded like glue. For most of the night this was McCollum, and it showed, as he shot 5-14. 

4. Norris Cole looked solid. Off the bench, Norris contributed 7 points, 2 assists, and a steal. I remember one play in particular with him. Portland ran a play, and right as the ball was going towards his man, Norris expected it. While his back is turned, Norris sticks his arms up and gets the steal. This play really showed his basketball IQ and awareness, something that we've been lacking from a backup point guard this year.

5. Our bench unit was solid. Our bench has continued to click and play extremely well as of late. Taj, Enes, and Doug played very solid games tonight. While the chemistry may not be completely there, our bench is a significantly greater threat than it was before.

6. Russ got tired. Russ was scoring like crazy. At the end of three, Russ had 40 points. However, he only scored 5 in the fourth quarter. Portland's defense forced him to work for every single shot he had, as they have players on their team that can guard multiple positions, Aminu in particular. 

7. We need Victor Oladipo. Victor would have been great tonight. This would have allowed us to ease the pressure off of Russ just a little bit, as Victor can at least handle the ball a little bit. Hopefully he is back in a few games.

Overall, tough loss, but I have to give credit to Portland. They worked as down throughout the game, and constantly hung with us and made us work for every basket. Nurkic killed us. In my opinion, he did more to win them the game than Damian Lillard did. He was able to create open shots for others from pretty much anywhere on the floor, as well as play solid defense, rebound the ball well, and score himself. If I were the Phoenix Suns, I would be very afraid of the team they're facing tonight. See you all tomorrow.","Random Observations from Tonight Tough loss tonight.

**Thunder's current cap situation:**


**Dead Cap -** The total cap that is allocated to dead contracts  
**Active Cap -** Amount of cap currently used on contracts (doesn't include dead contracts)  
**Total Cap -** Total amount of money used on contracts  
**Cap Space -** Amount team is over/under the Soft Cap designated by league - Available funds  
**Luxury Tax Space -** Amount team is over/under the luxury tax threshold set by the league  

*Us exceeding the Total Cap Space means that we can't sign new players to any contracts, we can only sign our current players. Once we exceed the Luxury Cap Threshold (set by the league) our team must pay Luxury Tax (set by the league). Each season we're in the luxury tax increases the amount we have to pay*

Here's where it gets a bit confusing, if you look at our info on the site above you'll see the figures are different, that's because they've included Qualifying Offers in their figures, I took them out as they're not set in stone as the Thunder can decline them.

------------------------------------------------------
**Terminology**

I've done my best to explain some of the terminology above but if there's any that I've miss hopefully I pick it up here



Term | Meaning
----|-------
Unrestricted Free Agent | Player that is free to sign with whichever team they choose
Restricted Free Agent | A player who's old team reserves the right to match any offers other teams give and signing them to that contract, they have 3 days to make this offer.
CBA | The Collective Bargaining Agreement is an agreement between the NBA and the players union that dictates the rules of salaries/contracts/trades/NBA draft and an assortment of other things. The new CBA takes place after this season.
Disabled Player Exception | Allows a team over the cap to sign a player for a max of 50% of the injured players salary if the player is unable to compete for the remainder of the season
Draft Picks | A right to draft a player at a teams allotted turn in the NBA draft, there are first round and second round picks. You may not trade first round picks in consecutive seasons.
Draft Lottery | Top 15 picks in the draft, these players tend to be the best in this years draft (Although outliers occur, ex Isaiah Thomas) The order is decided by a lottery, teams with the worst record gets the highest chance of getting the first pick.
Waive | A team that waives a player has them removed from the roster but continues to pay their salary for it's remainder. Those players become Unrestricted Free Agents and are free to sign a new contract.
Buyout | Immediately paying the remainder of a players contract and removing them from the roster, a buyout has to be agreed to by both parties.
Amnesty Clause | A means for a team to escape from a contract where a player is under performing compared to his salary. The team must still pay the salary but it no longer counts towards the cap. These players can then be 'auctioned' to other teams with the salary split between them.
Bird Rights | Named after the ugly duckling himself, Bird rights allow a team to exceed the soft cap to re-sign that player. The player must have played for 3 consecutive seasons with that team before they become eligible. A players Bird Rights are traded along with the player.
Roster Spots | Teams must have a minimum of 13 players, 12 active players and 1 inactive player and the NBA must have a league-wide average of 14 players. There are a maximum of 15 roster spots and 8 players must suit up (be available) for each game
D-League | The Development League is simply that, a place for players to practice their skills and get more time on the court in order to better prepare them for NBA playing time. Players sent to the D-League are automatically made inactive.
Playoff Roster | The roster must be set before the playoffs begin and cannot include players that have not played one regular season game or players waived after the 1st of March.
Protected Picks | A Pick that has been traded and has a restriction on it. For example if a pick is lottery protected it means that if that if the pick falls between the 1st and 15th picks of the draft the pick will return to the original team. Outside of that and it stays with the traded team.
Trade Exception |  Earned when a team trades a player with a higher salary than the one they're receiving, the amount is simply Player traded - Player received. The exception can only be used on contracts not free agents, last a year from the initial trade date and count towards the salary cap but not the luxury tax. Extremely useful when trading a pick for a player as at least part of that players contract can be eaten up by the exception.
Sign and Trade | Signing a free agent to a contract with the intent to immediately trade them (with the players consent). The free agents previous team can offer more money/longer contract to the player so the player gains a better contract, their previous team gets something out of a unrestricted free agent and the new team gains a player.
Stashed Player | Players that the team has the rights to and are often developing but have not signed them to a contract. There are Domestic and Euro stashes and both have an obligation to join the team when asked.

*I'll no doubt add more and correct a lot as I'm told

**Oklahoma City Thunder's Future**  

For right now there is nothing more we can do unless we waive another player, this is the team we're going to finish the season with.

As for next season, here are some of the more reasonable options:  

- Re-sign Andre Roberson
- Re-sign Taj Gibson
- Offer Nick Collison a front office position
- Offer Kendrick Perkins a front office position
- Waive and stretch Singler's contract: (Remaining contract) ÷ (years X 2 + 1) so (9,622,500) ÷ (2 X 2 + 1) = $1,932,500/5 years. Not the best but we're unlikely to package his contract anyway
- Either use/waive Huestis and trial other D-League players
- Sign some veterans with our free slots - Perkins would be good as a mentor to Kanter and would be cheap
- Trust in the demonic god that is Presti and his unholy talents
- Make use of our $7.5 million Trade Exception before the 1st of November
- Support the team



What we can't do:

- Sign another All-Star in the off season (We don't have the funds to bring Blake/Hayward/PG so stop suggesting it)
- Cripple our team in an attempt to do the above (People still think trading Kanter and a few other players for Butler would leave us better off)


Aside from this and no doubt others that I'm going to be told there isn't a whole lot we can do besides gel as a team, experiment with rotations and Thunder the fuck up.

**Thunder's current cap situation:**


**Dead Cap -** The total cap that is allocated to dead contracts  
**Active Cap -** Amount of cap currently used on contracts (doesn't include dead contracts)  
**Total Cap -** Total amount of money used on contracts  
**Cap Space -** Amount team is over/under the Soft Cap designated by league - Available funds  
**Luxury Tax Space -** Amount team is over/under the luxury tax threshold set by the league  

*Us exceeding the Total Cap Space means that we can't sign new players to any contracts, we can only sign our current players. Once we exceed the Luxury Cap Threshold (set by the league) our team must pay Luxury Tax (set by the league). Each season we're in the luxury tax increases the amount we have to pay*

Here's where it gets a bit confusing, if you look at our info on the site above you'll see the figures are different, that's because they've included Qualifying Offers in their figures, I took them out as they're not set in stone as the Thunder can decline them.

------------------------------------------------------
**Terminology**

I've done my best to explain some of the terminology above but if there's any that I've miss hopefully I pick it up here



Term | Meaning
----|-------
Unrestricted Free Agent | Player that is free to sign with whichever team they choose
Restricted Free Agent | A player who's old team reserves the right to match any offers other teams give and signing them to that contract, they have 3 days to make this offer.
CBA | The Collective Bargaining Agreement is an agreement between the NBA and the players union that dictates the rules of salaries/contracts/trades/NBA draft and an assortment of other things. The new CBA takes place after this season.
Disabled Player Exception | Allows a team over the cap to sign a player for a max of 50% of the injured players salary if the player is unable to compete for the remainder of the season
Draft Picks | A right to draft a player at a teams allotted turn in the NBA draft, there are first round and second round picks. You may not trade first round picks in consecutive seasons.
Draft Lottery | Top 15 picks in the draft, these players tend to be the best in this years draft (Although outliers occur, ex Isaiah Thomas) The order is decided by a lottery, teams with the worst record gets the highest chance of getting the first pick.
Waive | A team that waives a player has them removed from the roster but continues to pay their salary for it's remainder. Those players become Unrestricted Free Agents and are free to sign a new contract.
Buyout | Immediately paying the remainder of a players contract and removing them from the roster, a buyout has to be agreed to by both parties.
Amnesty Clause | A means for a team to escape from a contract where a player is under performing compared to his salary. The team must still pay the salary but it no longer counts towards the cap. These players can then be 'auctioned' to other teams with the salary split between them.
Bird Rights | Named after the ugly duckling himself, Bird rights allow a team to exceed the soft cap to re-sign that player. The player must have played for 3 consecutive seasons with that team before they become eligible. A players Bird Rights are traded along with the player.
Roster Spots | Teams must have a minimum of 13 players, 12 active players and 1 inactive player and the NBA must have a league-wide average of 14 players. There are a maximum of 15 roster spots and 8 players must suit up (be available) for each game
D-League | The Development League is simply that, a place for players to practice their skills and get more time on the court in order to better prepare them for NBA playing time. Players sent to the D-League are automatically made inactive.
Playoff Roster | The roster must be set before the playoffs begin and cannot include players that have not played one regular season game or players waived after the 1st of March.
Protected Picks | A Pick that has been traded and has a restriction on it. For example if a pick is lottery protected it means that if that if the pick falls between the 1st and 15th picks of the draft the pick will return to the original team. Outside of that and it stays with the traded team.
Trade Exception |  Earned when a team trades a player with a higher salary than the one they're receiving, the amount is simply Player traded - Player received. The exception can only be used on contracts not free agents, last a year from the initial trade date and count towards the salary cap but not the luxury tax. Extremely useful when trading a pick for a player as at least part of that players contract can be eaten up by the exception.
Sign and Trade | Signing a free agent to a contract with the intent to immediately trade them (with the players consent). The free agents previous team can offer more money/longer contract to the player so the player gains a better contract, their previous team gets something out of a unrestricted free agent and the new team gains a player.
Stashed Player | Players that the team has the rights to and are often developing but have not signed them to a contract. There are Domestic and Euro stashes and both have an obligation to join the team when asked.

*I'll no doubt add more and correct a lot as I'm told

"What. A. Win. We fell off at the end until we didn't. So, let's get into the observations.


1. The new additions came to play. Doug had his breakout party, and both were solid contributors throughout the night, making very few mistakes between them.

2. Oladipo being out is a blessing in disguise. This has forced Abrines into the starting lineup, and boy has he performed. While he only had 11 points tonight, he shot 4/4, 3/3 from deep. He was constantly moving on offense and became a threat.

3. We hit 12 in a row from deep. Yes, 12. No, I didn't mean 1, it was 12. We were blistering from deep tonight. While we did eventually cool of, 68% is still scorching from deep.

4. Utah almost had us at the end. Our offense began to stagnate in the fourth, but we were playing one of the best defenses in the NBA. The Jazz are a great team, and the fact that we were able to beat them in a close game is huge.

5. Russell. Westbrook. Took. Over. Russ scored 14 straight points in the fourth quarter to not only keep us in it, but also win it. He had 43/11/11 while playing pretty solid defense throughout the night. This game in my eyes solidifies him as the favorite to win MVP. More importantly to Russell though, we got the W.

We are getting hot at the right time. I think it's completely realistic for us to finish as the four seed by the end of the year.

"This summer RW has to indicate to management about his future intentions.  His 3rd season is a player option which means beginning next season he must be viewed as a player in his final season of his contract.  Exactly where we were last year.  Getting him to commit long term still remains the primary goal, in my opinion.  

Second fact, RW winning the MVP award will go a long ways toward getting him to stay.  He will feel (like many of us do here) that Presti is going to build a team explicitly for him, similar to how the Rockets have done for Harden.  In addition, winning the MVP will make it much harder to make a case that losing in LA (or winning with another superstar) could be a better move than winning in OKC.  He can win MVPs here and we can build a perennial contender around him over time.  That's enough, right?

Thirdly, OKC as a 4 seed, one seed behind the Rockets (with Harden's candidacy), gives him a very good chance at getting the award.  I don't think there is anything RW can do to win the award if OKC remains the 7 seed.  I don't recall the stats, but MVPs tend to go to guys on winning teams.  

That begin said, I really don't like the 4 seed.  I don't see us with a fundamentally different chance of beating the clips or Utah in a series as a do against San Antonio.  And if you can beat San Antonio then you have a really good chance of making the WCF.  We match up well still with SA.  Playing the Clips is like the worst experience in the world.  If we are honest, the 4 seed is a guaranteed second round exit.  So just in terms of this season, I like the 7 seed a lot more.  On the other hand, I think RW has done everything he needs to do to win the MVP.  The only thing missing is team performance, which is only going to come through a push up to the 4 seed.","Why we need the 4 seed, the longer view.

"Tonights game was a great win for us, even though we did slow down significantly. If the demand is there, I would love to make this a regular thing for each game. Let's get into it.

1. Russ played a bad game, and still got a triple double. I'm not sure if I've ever seen him shoot worse, but he still managed to score and get the offense going, which really speaks to the quality of player he is, as well as the overall confidence of the team. We were able to get it going when he couldn't.

2. I love our new additions. Taj and Dougie both played very well, even though they just got here last night. I cannot wait to see what they bring to the team going forward.

3. Enes played poorly in his return. I'm largely ok with this, as he's coming back from a broken arm. Once he gets it going, it'll be great to see how our offense will continue to click.

4. I love Alex Abrines. He shot the lights out and was clearly feeling it. I was unsure how he would be with our starting lineup, but I absolutely loved him there. Hopefully he can keep it going.

5. Andre. Roberson. I love that man. I can't believe just a day ago I was almost coming to terms with trading him away. He's such a great player for us, and really showed it tonight. He was feeling it. Yes, you read that right, Andre Roberson was feeling it. 8/9 from the field, 3/3 from deep. This was one of his best games I have ever seen him play.

Solid win tonight, even though it was against the Lakers. We proved as a team we could get it going when Russ and Kanter couldn't seem to hit from the field, and without Oladipo. We had great offensive rhythm for most of the game, and even ran the Spain pick and Roll(!!!). I'm very excited to see how we match up against New Orleans on Sunday. My prediction is Russ goes off and has one of his best games of the year.","Tonight's Observations Tonights game was a great win for us, even though we did slow down significantly. If the demand is there, I would love to make this a regular thing for each game. Let's get into it.

1. Russ played a bad game, and still got a triple double. I'm not sure if I've ever seen him shoot worse, but he still managed to score and get the offense going, which really speaks to the quality of player he is, as well as the overall confidence of the team. We were able to get it going when he couldn't.

2. I love our new additions. Taj and Dougie both played very well, even though they just got here last night. I cannot wait to see what they bring to the team going forward.

3. Enes played poorly in his return. I'm largely ok with this, as he's coming back from a broken arm. Once he gets it going, it'll be great to see how our offense will continue to click.

4. I love Alex Abrines. He shot the lights out and was clearly feeling it. I was unsure how he would be with our starting lineup, but I absolutely loved him there. Hopefully he can keep it going.

5. Andre. Roberson. I love that man. I can't believe just a day ago I was almost coming to terms with trading him away. He's such a great player for us, and really showed it tonight.

"Hey all.  Sorry if this is out of place or anything, I tended to do these odd analytic studies over at the Bulls subreddit, I figured if you all were interested I'd come over here are post one of the more intriguing ones I've found.

Basically, the gist of it is that the Bulls were a demonstrably better team the more shots we were generating for Douggie a game.

Almost all of Doug's shot attempts are assisted:  80% of his attempts from 2 (180 out of 224), and 100% (!) of his attempts from 3 (150 out of 150).  He's decent at creating his own shot, but almost of all said opportunities come from putting one or two dribbles down to create space, which still ends up as assisted most of the time.  In other words, Doug is reliant on the team's ability to get him the ball in order to be effective.

Now, here's where it gets interesting, and I found this out mostly accidentally just looking through game logs.  The Bulls have been around a .500 team for Doug's tenure there, and for the sake of argument I'm going to discount his rookie year, where incredibly limited playing time really made the year statistically insignificant.  So, in his year and a half with the Bulls, what do you find?  Well, it turns out that even when his shots aren't going in, the Bulls played much better when they were trying to get him open looks.  

When Doug attempted 9+, the Bulls were 15-6 this season.

When he attempted fewer than 9 shots, the Bulls were 7-16 (12-22 if you include the games where he didn't play due to concussion).

This is a trend that started last season too, together, when he played, the Bulls were 38-21 when Doug attempted 9+ shots, and 26-40 when he attempted fewer.

Now, does this mean that there is a direct causal link between Doug's shot total and wins? Of course not, but there is certainly a very strong correlation, and an odd one at that, that a .500 team would swing so drastically around.","The Doug McDermott Effect Hey all.

"Currently we have 14/15 spots on our roster. We are not sure on who gets the 15th spot as of yet. However, we can still draw valid guesses on who plays where.

Remember when I said we live and die by the bench? Well it's true. And with the additions of Gibson and McDermott, and the return of Kanter, we could easily be scoring 30 points of the bench.

However, I don't think McDermott will be a bench player. If he is, Grant will not be getting any minutes. We could play him at PF but we have Taj and Sabonis there already. So I think we will go back to starting Roberson at SG and have Oladipo lead our bench.

PG-Russ/Oladipo/Semaj
SG-Roberson/Abrines/McDermott
SF-McDermott/Grant/Abrines
PF-Taj/Sabonis/Grant
C-Adams/Kanter/Taj

Something like this could work. Although I'm guessing we will sign a veteran PG and keep Oladipo at SG.

Now, onto the fun part:

No matter how good Westbrook plays, if the Thunder bench can't get at least 30 points, we lose. Our goal is to have the bench score at least 35+ points every game. Our starting line up is pretty consistent and gets about 70 points a game so we shouldn't be worried about them now.

What I think Donovan should do is have a rotation that looks like this:

PG-Dipo
SG-Abrines
SF-McDermott
PF-Grant
C-Kanter

All of these players, with the exception of Kanter, can shoot from the 3. And with Kanter's insane ability to grab offensive rebounds, this could work in our favor. We might be shorthanded on defense in this rotation but not by a lot. Grant currently leads our team in blocks. Totaling 62. And let's not assume that Kanter is absolute trash on defense either.

McDermott's eFG% is 70%. And if you watch his highlights, he is a great spot-up shooter. Presti and Donovan both know this. And the best way to utilize this is by having him and Abrines on the wings.

With Taj Gibson, I don't see him playing center. He is there to help rebound and take up minutes for Sabonis to help him develop. He is currently playing 27.6 MPG and getting 11.6 PPG to go along with 7.0 RPG. My guess is he'll be getting 20-25 MPG. But other than that, I see no change in his other stats.

Also, this one surprised me: Taj Gibson already has 11 double-doubles in this season. Third highest in his career. (1.18, 2.15). 

With Taj, Sabonis, Grant, Kanter, and Adams, I don't think Perkins will get a deal. But it wouldn't surprise me if he did. I hope he does.





","Thunder Analysis Currently we have 14/15 spots on our roster. We are not sure on who gets the 15th spot as of yet. However, we can still draw valid guesses on who plays where.

Remember when I said we live and die by the bench? Well it's true. And with the additions of Gibson and McDermott, and the return of Kanter, we could easily be scoring 30 points of the bench.

However, I don't think McDermott will be a bench player. If he is, Grant will not be getting any minutes. We could play him at PF but we have Taj and Sabonis there already. So I think we will go back to starting Roberson at SG and have Oladipo lead our bench.

PG-Russ/Oladipo/Semaj
SG-Roberson/Abrines/McDermott
SF-McDermott/Grant/Abrines
PF-Taj/Sabonis/Grant
C-Adams/Kanter/Taj

Something like this could work. Although I'm guessing we will sign a veteran PG and keep Oladipo at SG.

Now, onto the fun part:

No matter how good Westbrook plays, if the Thunder bench can't get at least 30 points, we lose. Our goal is to have the bench score at least 35+ points every game. Our starting line up is pretty consistent and gets about 70 points a game so we shouldn't be worried about them now.

What I think Donovan should do is have a rotation that looks like this:

PG-Dipo
SG-Abrines
SF-McDermott
PF-Grant
C-Kanter

All of these players, with the exception of Kanter, can shoot from the 3. And with Kanter's insane ability to grab offensive rebounds, this could work in our favor. We might be shorthanded on defense in this rotation but not by a lot. Grant currently leads our team in blocks. Totaling 62. And let's not assume that Kanter is absolute trash on defense either.

McDermott's eFG% is 70%. And if you watch his highlights, he is a great spot-up shooter. Presti and Donovan both know this. And the best way to utilize this is by having him and Abrines on the wings.

"Okie here. Been a die hard fan since the move from Seattle. These trade ideas coming up seem to be a lot of short term fixes. (Chandler, Gallinari.) The mindset of this league now seems to be now getting a big 4. This deadline I believe will truly present the mindset of the OKC organization going forward. 

My hope is to build around Westbrook. But to do this it will take a long term investment (that hard to swallow 2-3 years) but it won't be with this starting team. From the foundation up we need to build this team in the mirror image of its leader. From the bottom up. 
We need scrappy players. As gets quoted ""blue collar"" guys. 

The best way to preserve our indentity is to build with the guy with the chip. The imperfect. Westbrook if you remember at UCLA was this guy. It took will, and guts to make this superstar. I think that is what we look at now. Not for the shiny new thing on the lot but the 69' Boss Mustang that's beat up but we got the motor running, we just need to put time in the garage.

"While watching the Thunder games, I noticed a trend. It's kind of an obvious one but it doesn't get much attention. And it has to do with our bench.

Our bench is horrible without Kanter. That's not a surprise. Although it is a good practice for the bench players to see how good they are without him. And while a lot of you are focusing on bringing a SF to our team, I have been looking at the bench.

So I'll get straight into it. When our bench scores less than 30 points, their record is 4-10. When they score more than 30, they are 28-15. When they score 35+ they are 22-11. And when they score 40+ they are 13-5. Which means that when our bench scores less than 40 points, they are 19-20.

Simply put, we need to focus on getting a bench player that can get us around 15 points a game. Obviously a PG. One that can shoot 3s and dish out assists. And when Kanter comes back, him and Kanter could be a duo. If these two players could get 25 ppg that'll be great. Our other bench players could get the other 15. This will solidify our bench and give Westbrook more time to rest. A win-win situation.

Now if we had the option to get a back-up PG or a starting SF before the trade deadline, I'd go with the PG. Then find a SF to sign during the offseason.

"1. That was one of the best games I've seen Russ play. He was hitting everything, and that's partially due to his great shot selection tonight.

2. Oladipo played great. He went off and was able to hit from both inside and out.

3. Roberson and Grant both played great defense on Anthony. You couldn't guard Carmelo any better(outside of a few late closeouts). While he was hitting everything, overall we played solid defense.

4. We didn't really lose momentum at any point. Once we got momentum going finally, we ended up keeping it, regardless of whether or not our bench was on the floor. This is an extremely bright sign, albeit against the Knicks.

5. Cameron Payne is in his sophomore slump. While his numbers may not look worse then last year, overall I really feel as if he's been worse this year. However, I don't think we should give up hope on him. He stills shows flashes of being a serviceable guard, is a second year player, and missed a good portion of the season with a foot injury. While I don't feel confident in him running our offense, once Enes comes back the pressure will be eased off of him.

"First off – I am sorry. I am sorry for not letting you get away from these shit narratives that surround our team and the general ESPN Agenda (Hi Chris Haynes!) where they go out of their way to say that KD was right to get away from the hell that is OKC and that we all deserve to die. It has been a rough season for sure, with plenty of trigger spikes throughout. It for sure hasn’t helped that the circle jerk in /r/nba this year has zoned in on us as a team and Russ in particular. Not only did we take a huge hit from left field when KD, who as recently as last year (or whenever it was) talked about wanting to stay with us forever, left us for GS and in one fell swoop ruined the competition for years to come in the west, but for some reason we also deserve to get shit upon as if we didn’t deserve a great player like KD in the first place. I felt like the KD in OKC game would be cathartic, but the media shit storm surrounding it has kind of ruined it for me, so I am still looking for closure. I figured another discussion here in the Thunderdome could help with getting some aggression out.

With all this said – here’s Sports Illustrateds NBA writer Andrew Sharp (of Grantland fame) on Russell Westbrooks place in the NBA, while discussing his “unpopular NBA opinions” (Open Floor Podcast – Extended Mailbag from February 3), 1:11:15:

Andrew Sharp (AS): The last one – Russell Westbrook is the most overrated player in basketball.

Ben Golliver (BG): Ohh God, dude? This is one of your unpopular opinions?

AS: Yeah! Look…

BG: You just buried it 75 minutes deep in this taping session?

AS: It’s actually not really my brand to be skeptical of Russell Westbrook, and I appreciate Russ for what he is, I just think he has to win on his terms and his terms sort of hurt the rest of the team. Uhh, and I think, of all the MVP candidates he is the most ridiculous – he ran off Kevin Durant! Like are we not gonna acknowledge that that happened?

BG: Wooow. Woow, wow. Ok, slow down for one second. When you’re saying overrated, what do you think most people are rating him as? Like where is he in the pecking order?

AS: I think a lot, I see a lot of people calling him a top 5 player in the league, and that happened last year and it happened over the summer… He’s not! He’s an ATROCIOUS defender. If you wanna talk about Isaiah Thomas’ defense and not talk about Westbrooks defense, I don’t know what to tell you, cause he is just as bad and he stat chases and he can’t, and like his meltdowns particularly at the end of games and against good teams, like every Thunder playoff run ends the same way, with Russ making inexplicable, indefensible decisions. So, all I’m saying is that he’s good, but he is not, like, and it’s actually, he’s been overrated for a long time, because the Thunder chose Westbrook over Harden and that didn’t make sense at the time. So, it’s just something to think about.

BG: What’s amazing about this rhetorical device you just used is that you spun my own logic back on me and I’m having a really hard time coming back, because I literally just said that the most entertaining is not the most valuable, and Westbrook is a great example of that, because he is far more entertaining to watch, especially when he is on, than maybe his total value would be, but still, I mean this guy brings so much to the table, consistency, work ethic, offensive impact, defensively he is a lot better than Isaiah, so don’t try to play that card.

AS: I’ll put it this way, Russell Westbrook is allegedly a top 5 player, fine, whatever, people can say whatever they want. I would not want the Wizards to trade John Wall, who is not a top 5 player in anyone’s eyes, I would not want a Wall for Westbrook trade. I wouldn’t even want the Wizards to trade Bradley Beal for Russell Westbrook, because I think (BG: OMG) he makes life so much more stressful for the rest of the roster and it doesn’t make sense.

BG: All right, I sat through like 19 Wizards questions, I’m not gonna allow you to try to tell me that Bradley Beal is better than Russell Westbrook.

AS: I’m, it’s just in terms of the rest of the team, he would be a pain in the ass to deal with for the other stars, if you are trying to build a title team.

BG: Sigh, all right.

AS: Haha, we have officially gone too far, so, the unpopular opinion, it opened the door and I have officially taken it too far. So all I’m saying is that Russ is not a top 5 player, I’ll leave it at that.

BG: I guess if the argument is, is a better pairing Wall and Beal or Wall and Westbrook, yeah that’s pretty redundant, but what about if you had the option of Westbrook and Beal?

AS: Uuuh, I would rather have Wall and Beal. Like that is not, I don’t even think that’s even that hot of a take at this point. Wall is a better point guard than Russell Westbrook.

BG: Ouff, boy oh boy. Well, that’s why it’s the unpopular opinion. That’s why we buried it this far. Hopefully nobody discovers this, doesn’t make a headline out of it, I don’t want to be associated with it. I’ll take Westbrook over Wall, I think Wall doesn’t get enough credit… I think, There’s something to what you are saying about ‘is he the most overrated’, because I think if people are automatically giving him the 1 or 2 spot in the MVP conversation, that’s a mistake, I don’t think he just deserves that off the top, I think there’s a lot of people, and…

AS: Yeah, well, and he’s putting up crazy numbers but that’s because he ran off Kevin Durant and it’s because he’s basically, his game is such that the Thunder have had to build (with?) guys around him who don’t know how to score and who are good at other things. So the Thunder have designed their entire team for Russell Westbrook to get triple doubles every night, which is great and it’s great if you wanna get a seven seed, you know what I mean?

BG: Yeah, I don’t even know how well they designed it for that purpose, it’s just sort of like that’s the only option they have.

End transcript.

We all know that NBA writers read /r/nba, so how the hell can he call the circle jerkiest opinion ever an unpopular one? I used to like Sharp a lot (on Grantland for example) but this ruined it for me. It’s such uninformed and frankly hateful bullshit. Fuck Andrew Sharp for this. Like seriously. How can watching NBA games on a nightly basis for years and years be your job, and you have this fucked up of an opinion?

I'm sorry for shitty formatting.

I am sure by now most of you have heard about Ibaka being traded to us.  I asked r/magic about Ibaka but considering he didn't play long enough to get a true assessment of his game, I was hoping to get your input.

First off why was there a falling out between Ibaka and the organization?

Second how was his play just before he left, I felt his defensive game dropped off a bit, but made up for it by adding a much more efficient 3pt shot.

He will be coming into a similar system you guys ran when you had Bestbrook, and the other guy.  He fills in a need for us, that we have been looking for the last 3 seasons.

"After seeing so many posts about Okafor's horrible defense and that's why any team who gets him shouldn't give up more than a bag of chips made me think of Kanter.  Remember how bad his defense was when we traded for him?  It was bad.  Like, historically bad.  This year the eye test has shown he's way better than before.  So I dug up some rim protecting stats for him:

* A few years ago Enes Kanter had a -3.50 DRPM (historically bad). That was easily dead last.  This year he is third from last but at a -.84 .  DRPM is supposed to take in past years performances in it's calculations so an improvement of that amount says something.

* Kanter used to let players score on him at will.  2 years ago he used to let [opossing players score 1.2% better on him than average](http://stats.nba.com/player/#!/202683/defense-dash/?Season=2014-15&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) .  For a Center this is horrible.  Last year he forced opponents to shoot [3.5% worse than average](http://stats.nba.com/player/#!/202683/defense-dash/?Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) .  And this year it's a whopping [6% worse](http://stats.nba.com/player/#!/202683/defense-dash/?Season=2016-17&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) .  

* That number puts him at [25th in the league](http://stats.nba.com/players/defense-dash-lt6/#!?Season=2016-17&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&PlayerPosition=C&CF=GP*GE*30&sort=PLUSMINUS&dir=-1) .  That's ahead of guys like Steven Adams and Anthony Davis.  And he's doing it on greater than 5 attempts per game which is higher than a Pau, Favors or Howard.

Now the player tracking and DRPM stats aren't the best.  In fact for perimeter players they are nearly useless because of how scheme affects their ability to be the primary defender.  Westbrook, for example, has *horrible* rim protector statistics but that's because he shouldn't be in the position to protect the rim.

For bigs it is a different story.  And I think it's worth noting that Kanter has transformed himself from being a defensive liability to being *above average* for a starter.  He also is in the position to defend a lot of shots which means these numbers aren't just noise.

This is a huge testament to the Thunder's coaching staff and culture.  Kanter gets ragged on a lot on that NBA subreddit and at this point it's not deserved.  And personally I think his improved defense and passing has put him into the untouchable category for our team.

Just keep him away from chairs.","Too much Katy talk. Here is something positive: A little digging I did on Kanter's vastly improved defense.

Sucks that we didn't win but at least the team fought for every point that could be earned, as expected we just couldn't match up with their firepower.



It really sucks that we couldn't get GSW on home court earlier because its been half a year since the decision 2.0 which made the wounds a bit less fresh, but at least we finally got to vent our frustrations. I feel a bit more delighted after yesterday as a Thunder fan, as we could finally show that it wasn't just a media stunt.



Like all of us, i will still say fuck KD but we shouldn't keep bringing him up anymore, especially on this sub. It's good to have a rivalry (with GSW) but it shouldn't be more important to hate an opposing player, than to actually care about your own team. If we could get one more good fitting piece next to Russ before the tradeline, we could still make a lot of noise in the playoffs, and THAT is what should matter most to us.

It really sucks that we couldn't get GSW on home court earlier because its been half a year since the decision 2.0 which made the wounds a bit less fresh, but at least we finally got to vent our frustrations. I feel a bit more delighted after yesterday as a Thunder fan, as we could finally show that it wasn't just a media stunt.



Like all of us, i will still say fuck KD but we shouldn't keep bringing him up anymore, especially on this sub. It's good to have a rivalry (with GSW) but it shouldn't be more important to hate an opposing player, than to actually care about your own team. If we could get one more good fitting piece next to Russ before the tradeline, we could still make a lot of noise in the playoffs, and THAT is what should matter most to us. So please stop bringing up our 7 foot ex-girlfriend and focus on the future.",8,21,"We got what we wanted, now let's get back on track.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/5tmwmz/we_got_what_we_wanted_now_lets_get_back_on_track/

1. We struggled on defense tonight. Granted, how can you not against golden state? There were several possessions where going under screens instead of over lead to three pointers, or even open drives.

2. I love Andre Roberson. While he might not be able to score baskets, him standing up to KD went miles for me. 

3. Russ played great. No shit, he just about always does. He was able to dominate whoever was guarding him no matter what. While he did have a lot of turnovers, golden state is a solid defensive team.

4. We miss Kanter. Our bench unit runs best when operated through Kanter, and not Payne. As much as I love Cam, I don't feel confident in his ability to run an offense.

"I've been thinking about the upcoming game on Saturday against the Warriors, and here are my general thoughts and opinions regarding the crowd atmosphere.

-I'm hoping for a really hostile crowd. I want that arena to feel intimidating and more like a European soccer game instead of an NBA game. Those European stadiums have some very intimidating crowds that put doubts in the back of your mind about what's going to happen. Because we know Cupcake wilts under pressure, I hope that atmosphere makes him want to crap his pants.

-If it was up to me, there would be dead silence when introducing the traitor. Complete indifference would hit him harder than boos. However, we know that there will be plenty of boos, so boo away. I'll personally be pissed if I hear any cheers from the crowd.

-Cupcake signs would be cool, but if you really wanted to stick it to him, a big Monica Wright head cutout would do the trick. She ended it with him because he's a cheater and according to the rumors, he still pines for her. 

-Westbrook should receive the loudest cheers at all times. I'm hoping for the loudest ""MVP"" chant I have ever heard from a crowd.","Thoughts About Saturday's Game.

"Other than 2012 and 2014, Thunder have had great success in identifying talent in the NBA draft. BUT, since 2010 Thunder have abysmally traded away that first round talent resulting in -0- talent. 

Below is a low at Thunder first round picks and eventual roster moves. 

2007: Durant (2) 
-	*insert theme song from Titanic followed by Cee-Lo's famous ode followed by Titanic again*  
2008: Russ(4), Ibaka(24)
-	Russ is Russtastic. Present day Oscar Robertson. Future HOF. Future NBA MVP.  Future NBA Finals MVP. 
-	Trade Ibaka for Oladipo in 2016. Serge setting career high in PPG, 3pt %, FT % and assists for Magic while Victor is at his lowest production since his rookie year.  
2009: Harden(3), Mullens (24) [Dallas trade for 2010 draft pick]
-	At least it wasn't a ""We got nothing for Durant"" as Adams has been efficient low post score and defender. Still stings though.  In an era when Luxury tax means cancelling that extra Bora Bora vacation so that the team could win a championship(s), OKC chose to ship out Mr. Adidas because Scott Brooks couldn’t figure out what Golden State (and Steve Kerr) is currently mastering--managing superstars.
-	Mullens was the beginning of the end. 2 years for OKC, traded to Charlotte and currently in D-league.  Thunder got Abrines in 2013 draft.  Too early to tell what Abrines will do but signs point to career back-up.

2010: Aldrich (11) [Clippers get 18th pick and Dallas gets 21st and 26th pick--Bledsoe(18) [traded to Clippers for future first round pick, Craig Brackins(21), Quincy Pondexter(26)]
-	Mullens, after colossally sucking, required Thunder to trade away future all-star Eric Bledsoe from a guard heavy team for frontcourt support.  Aldrich, currently with T-Wolves averaging 1.8 ppg, was also a colossal suck. 
-	Bledsoe meanwhile went on to flutter for the Clippers and flourish for the Suns. Currently avg. 21 ppg.
-	Pondexter, a serviceable 3pt sniper that would have surely helped Thunder win 2013 championship, now retired.

2011: Reggie J. (24)
-	Traded to Pistons, landing Enes Kanter in OKC which eventually lead Thunder to put Ibaka on trade notice. Jackson has started every game for Detroit since trade averaging 16-3-5.  

2012: Perry Jones (28)
-	Did nothing for OKC but display injury-prone athleticism one a month.  Now in the NBDL. No trade value and provided OKC nothing but jersey sales. 

2013: Adams(12) [pick from Harden trade], Roberson (26) [Archie Goodwin (29) trade]
-	Adams turned into fearsome post defender and great low block scorer.  No shooting range limits outside threat but great foul shooter for big man.  Only averaging 3 FT per game, could be more aggressive.  
-	Only good thing about Roberson is that Thunder could have had Goodwin who is currently in the NBDL. He shoots like a high school Shawn Marrion and smiles as much as a Canadian weatherman.

2014: McGary (21)[Harden protected trade], Huestis (29)
-	McGary came on the scene with a flurry of double-doubles but injuries and failed drug test landed him on the unemployed list.
-	Huestis is unknown because he’s never on the court. Wasted first round pick.

2015: Cam (14)
-	Forced to be full time back-up trading Reggie Jackson.  Hasn’t developed a consistent 3 pt. shot limiting his scoring ability.  Great on the ball defender, but too much offensive liability.

2016: Sabonis (11) [Magic trade for Ibaka]
-	Started every game for the Thunder averaged 6-3-1.  If he could get to 40% 3’s, and 50% on 2s, offensive efficiency would be hard to ignore.

"But you can bet your ass I requested off for Saturday night months ago because THUNDER UP! BECAUSE WHY NOTT? BECAUSE BRODIE! BECAUSE KD RUINED HIS LEGACY FOREVER!

There's no way I'm going to miss Cupcake-Sellout-Traitor-Draymond's Assistant return to the franchise he built for 9 years about which he made multiple statements assuring everybody that he ""loved OKC and won't ever leave"", ""couldn't imagine playing anywhere else"" and my personal favorite, ""I'm in OKC till they don't want me no more"". 

Call me bitter (bc I am!) but I don't think this dude deserves any applause whatsoever this weekend from the Thunder faithful. MAYBE if he were in a different jersey could I see some appreciation being warranted yeah he did so much for the community blah blah blah but he'll be in a Warrior jersey. The team that had the greatest regular season record in NBA history, the team with a two time consecutive league MVP (which is BS but that's another story), the team with three other All Stars (one of them a Finals MVP), but most importantly it's a team that stole OKC's trip to the Finals. A team that knocked us out of the WCF even after being down 3-1. A team who employs a guy who kicked one of KD's teammates in the balls TWICE. You're gonna join THAT team? The team that just beat you? You let them come back from 3-1 and steal your chance at bringing an NBA Championship to OKC where you've fought so hard for 9 years to accomplish. That doesn't make KD say ""No way I'm letting this happen next year, we're beating this punk ass dirty team next year and we're getting that ring no matter what"" but instead it makes him say ""You know, why don't I just join this GS team? I'm besties with most of them already and I mean that almost automatically ups my chances of getting a ring by like 90% and I'll only have to do like 25% of the work to get it!"" 

So if you can somehow possibly respect a guy with such low competitive nature and cheer for him, well good for you I guess. Maybe I need more therapy. Either way I'll still be rooting for this entertaining and promising Thunder squad led by the incredible Russell Westbrook, aka The Real Slim Shady Who Has Always Been Standing and Never Remained Seated, aka this generation's Kobe in terms of fierceness, aka the guy Michael Jordan sees the most of himself in. I'll never cheer or root for that guy wearing the jersey he's wearing now. And personally I don't think any Thunder fan should... 

I'm so pumped for Saturday that I keep forgetting we get to take on the Cavs again on Thursday. Another face off between the best two players in the league. But Saturday will be fun... hopefully the third time's the charm? Russ and the guys will be totally pumped up as usual but maybe the fact that this one's at home will give us the edge and increase our ability to sustain the game's momentum. And maybe KD will be completely screwed up by the emotions of returning and he'll have another amazing 2-10 FG, 0-6 from 3 game!

"I think that the enduring dislike many Thunder fans---as well as many Thunder players, current or former---have for Reggie Jackson is now understood in full by many Pistons fans. I personally had suspicions about his attitude, given the enormously unprofessional nature of his departure from Oklahoma City. I had more upon witnessing his egoistic play during his early days with the Pistons, then anxiety when Van Gundy announced that “This is not a tryout.” 

Jackson did fairly well last season—even if he did dominate usage—because he was an able offensive player on a team with very little firepower, thus giving him full reign as the team's primary option. This season, the team is different, and things have gone downhill. Sure, he was injured, and it appears his athleticism may be impaired in the long-term as a result. That's not his fault, so I'll stick to the mental. I'll explain in short: 

* He has a **MASSIVE** EGO. As should be a surprise to nobody here—this is the guy who demanded a primary role with Westbrook ahead of him—Jackson will accept nothing less than the primary role on offense. No ifs, ands, or buts, and no matter whether it's best for the team or not. He's perfectly willing to hijack the offense, even if it's going very poorly. He'll run endless isolations and pip-and-pops, regardless of success rate or if there are other, more effective shooters on the floor. Late game? Forget about it. He's going to shoot the ball on every possession. To his credit, he was great in crunch time last season. He's done terribly in late-game scenarios this season, but he doesn't care. He's going to shoot anyway. He's lost the Pistons several games this way. 

* He's an **awful** teammate. This falls in with the ego part. He doesn't care about what's best for the team, but rather only about getting his. When he returned from injury, the Ish Smith-led Pistons had a fairly efficient offense based around ball-movement and ball-sharing. Jackson promptly obliterated this system in favor of taking a volume of shots that ranked him in the top five of the NBA in shots per 100 possessions. He converted these at less than 40%. The offense and general morale tanked. Eventually his teammates called him to task in a players-only meeting whose thinly-veiled purpose was to castigate Reggie for his horribly egoistic, detrimental play. He spent the next game pouting and largely refusing to shoot. Terrible attitude. He then toned it down for a bit. And three games later, it was pretty much back to hero ball. 

* He seemingly has **no self-awareness**. He believes he's far, far better than he actually is. It was revealed recently in an interview that he models his game after that of Russell Westbrook. This is something that I had long suspected, and it would be musing if it weren't so destructive to the team. Jackson is nowhere near the basketball player that Russell Westbrook is. He nonetheless aims to play on offense like Westbrook does—but in the process, he forgets that Westbrook excels at creating opportunities for his teammates. Jackson just shoots the ball. He wants to score. Moreover, he has no recognition of the fact that he's physically less than he was last season. He wants his. Period. His effectiveness, both absolutely and relative to that of his teammates, is of no importance to him.

* He's got a **dreadful attitude**. If Van Gundy takes him out late in a game, for example, Jackson is petulant and pouty in post-game interviews. This has happened several times lately; Jackson is quite literally one of the worst defenders in the entire league—he has been an absolute calamity for the Pistons' defense—and so he's simply not reliable down the stretch, not to mention that his tendency to play hero ball in such situations is most often very bad for the team. Jackson either does not comprehend that Ish is a better option or simply does not care. Instead of being professional, he acts as if he's being shorted. Moreover, as mentioned, Jackson couldn't even take criticism from his teammates professionally. He played petulantly the entire next game. One camera shot caught him standing in the corner with his hands on his hips while his teammates moved on offense. 

So, yes, the Pistons have gotten a definite taste of what the Thunder did in 2015. Reggie Jackson is egoistic, selfish, and lacks utterly in self-awareness. And the Pistons are paying him $18m per year. Rough. 

So ends my rant. How's everyone doing today?

"Hi I have a suggestion to improve this subs content/get discussions going.

So in other sporting sub reddits, before a game they have a pinned post 'PRE-GAME MATCH THREAD' where people talk about the upcoming game, maybe we should start doing that, we could discuss lineups, injuries etc..

We have our discord during games so all good.

Then after the match have a pinned post called 'post match thread' people can discuss the game that just happened.

So these are just suggestions to keep the sub active on off days or just to generate good discussions so maybe we could give it a shot? If it doesn't do well then we tried!

With Kanter gone forces us to throw sabonis to the lions but I think this is good. His knowledge and skill level will go up a lot quicker. We will need that nice foot work and IQ down low because he's a rookie and rookies are usually undersized.

Dipo should find a lot more points in the next couple of months. Kanter was our 2nd highest scorer.

As we all know Russ had a tough game but still did good. But he know as you all do Kanter cleaned up the board that Russ couldn't finish lay up wise. He will have to evolve his game even more then he already has, not skill wise but patients and IQ wise.

Adams will have to tough it out playing longer minutes but Joffrey can spread the floor and shoot the 3 ball which opens up space for Adam and Russ and dipo.

Be prepared to have a couple of tough games while we try to find our new identity. Shooting percentages will drop but it's all a learning process.

Second squad will have to relay on the 3 ball, ball movement and less fouls but all this is easier said then done.

"Granted the team was established in 2008, so it's hard to argue there is much of a tradition set compared to the other greats in the NBA.

But consider the NBA as a whole, and how many teams since 2008 have made a Finals appearance, or have an MVP winner, or two-time NBA All Star MVP? Or Coach of the Year, and 6th Man of the Year winners?

This team has set a standard for itself early on, and the uniforms they did it in are the ones they should carry forward. 

Back in the 1990s and early 2000s, about a dozen teams went through a total rebrand: Seattle, Utah, Minnesota, Philly, Phoenix, Detroit, Atlanta, Cleveland, Golden State, Sacramento, Houston, Milwaukee, Washington and Dallas (NOTE: Memphis went through a rebrand upon moving from Vancouver). Those are the ones that come to mind off the top of my head. Of those, almost all of them went back to their traditional colors and logos, ultimately to be incorporated into their uniforms.

There are subtle ways to make uniform changes. Examples: LA Lakers, Boston Celtics, Miami Heat, Chicago Bulls, NY Knicks. But they don't go against tradition.

In the limited time this team has been in OKC, there is already a tradition established. I realize the name ""OKLAHOMA CITY"" looks big and bulky on a road uniform, or the name ""THUNDER"" sounds cheesy, but that's our tradition.

His relationship with Russell has blossomed which can be seen in the amount of times the pick and roll works for us or when Adams guns it to the deep post and immediately receives a pass from Russ. Its especially funny considering they have almost polar opposite on court personalities

"According to Marc Stein's article, Nuggets are shopping Gallinari and Wilson Chandler and I think the Thunder should target one of these guys. I'm not on the Rudy Gay train since almost every team he leaves somehow gets better after (a la Josh Smith). 

I believe the biggest missing piece is a scoring SF and these 2 are some of our best available options. Forget the Jimmy Butlers and the Gordon Haywards since OKC is not a great FA destination and we don't have a lot of money. 

Gallinari is a pretty good shooter and gets to the FT line extremely well and knocks down a solid %. His defense is average I'd say. However, he can't seem to stay healthy and his contract situation is murky. He makes $15 mil this year and has a player option for $16 mil for next year. I'm unsure of how his Bird Rights would or would not transfer over if he was traded (and without the Bird Rights, I don't believe we can go over the cap to sign him)

Wilson Chandler - A good shooter who can knock down 3s and plays very solid defense. He is also on a very good contract as he is making between $11 mil and $12 mil all the way through the 2018-2019 season. He also, however, has not been able to stay healthy but that is potentially a blip in his career (versus Gallinari getting injured midway through almost every season).

"It's kind of pissing me off how people are like 'I love Russ but Harden is MVP' after last night. Harden has probably the easiest PG job in the league maybe after Curry. He plays with team mates that can bomb it from 3 from 2 steps behind the line. Ariza, Gordon and Anderson (and even like Dekker etc) just catch a pass from Harden and it's going up. The Rockets are a much better team than OKC because 3>2. Basically their entire roster (excluding centers) can shoot the 3 better two steps back from the line off the dribble than our guards can wide open in the corner

The fact Russ is averaging 10+ assists with this OKC roster is much more impressive IMO. Even Adams and Kanter (probably our best other offensive options right now) are players that work through the post, which isn't conducive at all for getting assists as they take a while to make their moves. We can play like Abrines or Morrow, but other teams can just stand on them and take them out of the game. Rockets play all their 3 point threats at the same time, so you can't defend them like that

Just an example and I havent checked to see if this trade would actually be possible: 
We trade Kanter to the Clippers for smaller contract players. Once that's done, they'd still be able to go after CP3 and/or Griffin in order to resign them with their bird rights. That would allow the Thunder to get rid of their massive contracts, thus creating space for a potential FA signing.

"I will only discuss our main players ,so sorry fans around the nba no Singler and I will not discuss our rookies and player we hardly saw playing because of the small sample size. But you are welcomed to discuss those guys if interested. 

Westbrook (28) - His athleticism, explosiveness and speed will decrease with age. His future depends largely on developing a reliable jumper. If he can do that, he can easily play until his late 30s. A good example of this is Kobe, if you watched him in his youth, you sure know how athletic he was. Overtime he lost that athleticism, but developed strong shooting skills that compensated it.  If Wb cannot develop his jumper, he will share the fate of many uber athletic NBA players that faded overtime (such as Vince Carter, Allen Iverson, Tracy Mcgrady, Derrick Rose, Amare Stoudemire ...) 

Andre Roberson (25) - He is a defensive specialist, that part of his game is not likely to regress. He will sure lose some athleticism and speed but those can easily be compensated with experience. If he can develop a reliable 3pt, he can be one of the best 3 and D guys. Otherwise he will remain at this level. 

Victor Oladipo (24) -  This guy is also very athletic but his game depends less on athleticism. He seems to have a good jumper and that can easily develop more. I think his main drawback right now his bad decision making. It is not terribly bad and maybe it can be attributed to his age but from time to time he makes some very bad choices on the court. With better decision making, he can become an allstar. 

Enes Kanter (24) - Now kanter is an interesting case. He is probably the least athletic OKC player. So it is not likely he will lose effectiveness due to reduced athleticism. Even now he hardly jumps to get rebounds, he is good at it because of good positioning, strength and good anticipation of where the ball will bounce. To add to these, he plays around 20mpg, so there is less ""tread wear""  on his body. If he can develop to be at least a reliable defender with experience, he might be a more effective player in the future than he is today.

Steven Adams (23) - Adams is a wild type. His offensive game depends on athleticism. His defensive game on the other hand is not that much. In terms of his offence, I do not expect him to make as many dunks and alley ops as he ages. This is not only about making them, when you are that large, each jumping and landing takes a toll on your knees. So most NBA bigman reduce their jumping intentionally to avoid injury. This year he started to develop a reliable hook shot and post play. If he can add a jumper to his game, reduced athleticism will not be an issue.

"So, when the thunder initially traded Ibaka and received Sabonis/Dipo there ideal starting lineup was: Russ, Dre, KD, Sabonis, Adams with dipo being the scorer and ball handler off the bench. 

Obviously with no KD that makes this situation a little more complicated because you do not have a replacement at the 3 so you need to move Dre and bring in Dipo to start. 

My question is: If the thunder is able to bring in a good scoring/shooting 3 would you sacrifice Cam? He is a good young PG prospect but is still unproven and has some doubts. If Dipo gets moved to the bench he is more than capable of bringing the ball up the court and executing offense and would give guys like Morrow/Grant better spacing.

"I was commenting on another post about the schedule in January and got to thinking ... 

[Here is a link to the Thunder season schedule](http://www.espn.com/nba/team/schedule/_/name/okc), emphasis on January.

Fifteen games total. Only three at home.

My commentary on the other post was about how the Thunder would be ""lucky"" to end up .500 after next month. 

There's an old Chinese proverb, something about turning crisis into opportunity. Or is it, the symbols for crisis and opportunity are the same?

Mathematically, assuming the Thunder lose the last two games in December, they will be 20-14. From that, the Thunder will need to lose 11 of the 15 games in January to end up just below .500 (it's impossible to be exactly at .500 because it's an odd number of games, so I'm pushing them below it to prove my point). The three home games are against Denver, Memphis and Dallas. I think they win two of those, so they then go on to lose nine road games out of 12? Doubt it.

Now is the time for this team to flush the critics' diatribe down the drain. Let's recap. 

""Shouldn't be proud of beating the Sixers/Suns/Lakers.""

Got rid of that pretty early after beating the Clippers in LA.

""Russell is a stat padder.""

Russ has proven he would rather win than get a triple double, all while still averaging a triple double for the year.

What other narratives need to be destroyed? 

""Can't beat a contender.""

OK, now you have three opportunities. At Golden State on the 18th. At Cleveland on the 29th on ABC. At San Antonio the following game on the 31st. 

The scary part about typing all of this is that this team is streaky. They win in bunches, then lose in bunches. 

Something has to break. Something has to give. 

I think eventually the return of Oladipo and Payne will help this team address one of it's biggest deficiencies: shot generation. That's another debate in and of itself. 

For now, looking forward is for the best, whether it's win or lose.

"I'm lookng at the roster, and I'm a bit confused. On a regular night, when we are all healthy, we go with God/Dipo/Robes/Sabonis/Adams. The bench is kinda weird. Sometimes we play Kyle Singler, others we have Morrow for a lot of minutes. Guys like Joffy Boy, and Ab3ines are getting minutes now too. Christon has been interesting to watch, but Payne will be back(soon pls). Then we got guys like Grant(who we traded a protected first for). So here is my question. What is the depth chart for how Billy plays our players(like Robes at SF when he's really a SG etc) and where is the hole. This all came up when I wanted to make a thread about how we needed that back up SF, but we have Grant. And Sabonis/Grant should be okay. I was gonna suggest we go after a guy like Covington. Anyways, hella confused here, and would love some answers. Thanks in advance. ","What is our biggest need right now? I'm lookng at the roster, and I'm a bit confused.

"Since many think that January is the month of death for the Thunder I thought I'd see what the consensus here is.

Personally:

Clippers(Techinically in January), W. No Cp3, Blake, JJ and possibly no Dj. Don't see em winning.

Bucks: W, they are a good young team with Giannis but we should pull it off. 

Hornets: W, I think this one will be close but ultimately Clutchbrook will prevail.

Rockets: L, after a close back-to-back I think Houston will find the legs to win but we still put on a show just like the last two games.

Denver: W, it's a home game, it's denver. We got this.

Bulls: W, Chicago is struggling of late and I think we take advantage.

Memphis: W, I think we win by 10+ in this game. We do almost everything Memphis does but better and Injuries won't help(if they still have them)

TimberPups: W, they are a young team struggling to find their identity. We've beat them the last two times so I predict another 20 point beat down.

Kings: W, this is totally a winnable game but nothings off the table with us. We should win by 10+ but theres a chance we let this one slip. Either way, if we play like we have so far this is a W.

Clippers: W, with Blake Griffin out for sure and Chris Paul+JJ reddick possibly out this is a game we should win for sure.

Warriors: L, this is a much closer game but without Dipo I don't think we can steal it. Warriors are still a very solid squad so they take it by 5+.

Jazz: W, another solid playoff squad, yet we should win. I just think we've been better and Injuries will slow the Jazz down. 5+ point win.

Pelicans: W, Ad is great but he can't carry the Pels right now. This is arguably the worse team we have played in January to this point, so we should win easily.

Mavericks: W, It is a back-to-back but then again the mavs are one of the worst teams in the league, already taking the title from the Pelicans.

Cavs: L, Not much to say here. They're the defending champs and they will win at their house, especially if Dipo is stilling missing games this deep. Still a close entertaining game.

Spurs: W, I think we can win for several reasons. 1. The twin towers will absolutely destroy their bigs. 2. We're far more athletic and youthful. 3. Kawhi will focus a lot of defense effort on Westbrook, he'll be tired and Westbrook will become a facilitator. This will lead to our bigs destroying them even more.

So Overall 13-3 is my prediction, slightly optimistic but reachable. I personally just don't see it as scary as some others, lots of playoff teams that are below us and just straight up crap teams(plus injuried teams). The Spurs, Cavs and Warriors are our major competition this month and I say we get get atleast one W from there.

"As I write this I feel like the title sounds like a Harry Potter book. Anyway, an interesting thing to note is that Westbrook only averaged the 19th most minutes per game.

Two positives that I've gotten from it as the season has progressed are that it allows Westbrook a breather before he is unleashed in the fourth. Perhaps this break allows him to come out swinging and be the king of te fourth quarter that he has been this year.

"Not really a thunder post other than to discuss what's happening with a former Thunder player. I'm not sure if anyone has seen the drama in Detroit, but I wanted to make a post to discuss it. Here is the story from last night's game, which 2 clips from Reggie and Stan Van Gundy. Watch both clips. It's kind of hilarious.

http://nba.nbcsports.com/2016/12/20/reggie-jackson-stan-van-gundy-blame-each-other-for-pistons-point-guards-passivity/

Personally, Reggie Jackson is my most hated player in the NBA. I really don't hate players but the way that Reggie handled himself before getting traded pissed me off. He was clearly playing selfish basketball and wasn't in it for the team during his last season with the Thunder. It seems pretty clear that he is still a selfish player. 

I'm glad Reggie is someone else's problem. While he is a talented player and the Thunder could currently really use his skillset, his attitude can destroy a team's chemistry. I like a lot of the players on the Pistons and SVG is a great coach but as long as they have Reggie Jackson, I hope they are terrible. 

Anyways, just wanted to start a discussion about something other than the Thunder not playing well without Oladipo. Does anyone else hate Reggie as much as I do? Does anyone even care about Reggie at this point? If any Pistons fans stumble onto this post, I would love to hear your opinions of Reggie. To me, he is someone I would never want on my team. His starter but not all star level talent doesn't make up for his attitude in my book.","At least Reggie Jackson isn't our problem anymore Not really a thunder post other than to discuss what's happening with a former Thunder player.

"We have the ball with 12 seconds left down 2. No time out. What any coach would do. So Russ just has to play on, forces up a couple of tough shots (yes he got fouled but since when is that called, unfortunately). 3 seconds left. THEN Donovan calls a time out.

Better late than never, right? Only this ""genius"" coach, much like EVERY SINGLE TIME we have end of close game time outs, draws up nothing other than 'get the ball to russ for a contested 3 point shot'. 

I just don't get why okc fans continually defend Donovan. For those that love the guy, answer me this: What improvements has he made to our offence and our defence?

On offence, his first season was 'get the ball to Kevin and Russell'. Now, it's just Russell. It's predictable. It can work for most of the game, because Russel is just that good, but seriously. Consistently calling up time outs to achieve nothing other than getting Russ bad looks.

Our offence is generated entirely from improvisation. Entirely. Again, Russell is good enough to make this work. But it's pathetically predictable. Russ being the guy to take the shot I'm fine with- but the way he gets Russ ""open"" is terrible. Because he doesn't. He'll call time outs and achieve nothing that couldn't be accomplished by just giving the ball to Russ and telling him to make something happen (if that's not what he does during time outs anyway).

People claim he's some kind of genius. He really isn't. Playing Jerami Grant at the 5 doesn't make you Gregg Popovich. People love to point to his WCFs- where he was great for the first few games. I'll admit that. What about the last few? You know, when we needed to win just one more game. But we didn't, because he couldn't control his stars as they tried to hero ball their way to the finals. GS adjusted to his Roberson tactics,and he had nothing. Absolutely nothing. People love to forget this as they bring up his WCF performance.

I know by now I've just become that ""FIRE THE COACH!!11"" guy. But it pains me watching Donovan stumble his way through his coaching career while he gets nothing but blind support. 

Now, I will look at what people use to defend him. 

*'Westbrook won't listen anyway'*. This may well be true. Russ is great, but has major flaws that he's too stubborn to address. Maybe Donovan is trying. Here's the deal with that, though. It's the job of the coach to succeed in doing that. If Donovan isn't, then he isn't doing his job. The buck stops with him when it comes to managing players. 

'We're a young team and Russ has little scoring help'. True. This makes it an uphill battle. If you took Russ out of this team, it'd have the profile of a rebuilding team and we'd all be comfortable in giving Donovan years to grow with them. But does that mean he can't try to implement some kind of offence? Also, a few fancy Westbrook passes does not an offence make.

*'Payne is out, and when we rely on Semaj it goes to shit, because Semaj isn't ready'*. I know that isn't Donovan's fault. But you know what would help? Some kind of structure or system that players could rely upon no matter who's running the point. We don't have that. At all. We score with Russ because his improvisation is top tier, we don't score with Semaj because he doesn't improvise as well. But why are we relying on improvisation so much in the first place? It wouldn't matter as much if Semaj played within himself and ran some plays. Key word: Plays. We don't have them. Don't have to be full on Spurs-like, but we need something.

*'He's a genius because he experiments'*. I'll admit, his advantage over Brooks is that he's flexible. Sometimes he strikes gold in certain games. Sometimes he really, really doesn't. Being bold with lineups isn't always a good thing. 

Lastly: *'He's just an inexperienced NBA head coach in his second year, give him time'*. Ok. I fully acknowledge that not every coach is going to be NBA ready from day one. It would be hard to come in with no NBA coaching experience to try and control Durant/Westbrook, then just Westbrook. That's probably more on Presti hiring an inexperienced (in the NBA) coach and expecting him to control superstars off the bat. So here's the deal: Does Russ want to stay and play in his prime years, as a player that bases his game off of tremendous athleticism, not contending for a title because he has to wait to see if his coach *might* turn out? I certainly wouldn't blame him for leaving if everyone around him isn't as ready as he is.

This won't be too popular here. So if you don't agree (fair chance that applies to most reading this), that's fine, but try and show me these things:

-That we ran an effective offence, both in general play and particularly coming out of time outs, that isn't entirely dependent on Westbrook getting the ball and improvising

-That he's capable of reigning in Westbrook

-And that he can consistently make game winning decisions that aren't just a sample size of three WCF games

As it stands, I can't see any of those while watching our games. So I just can't understand how people do see it.","My (I promise you not an overreaction from a loss) Issues with Billy Donovan.

It would be hard to come in with no NBA coaching experience to try and control Durant/Westbrook, then just Westbrook. That's probably more on Presti hiring an inexperienced (in the NBA) coach and expecting him to control superstars off the bat. So here's the deal: Does Russ want to stay and play in his prime years, as a player that bases his game off of tremendous athleticism, not contending for a title because he has to wait to see if his coach *might* turn out? I certainly wouldn't blame him for leaving if everyone around him isn't as ready as he is.

This won't be too popular here. So if you don't agree (fair chance that applies to most reading this), that's fine, but try and show me these things:

-That we ran an effective offence, both in general play and particularly coming out of time outs, that isn't entirely dependent on Westbrook getting the ball and improvising

-That he's capable of reigning in Westbrook

-And that he can consistently make game winning decisions that aren't just a sample size of three WCF games

As it stands, I can't see any of those while watching our games. So I just can't understand how people do see it.",51,6,My (I promise you not an overreaction from a loss) Issues with Billy Donovan.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/5jb7eo/my_i_promise_you_not_an_overreaction_from_a_loss/

"Thats the thing I love most about this team, we have such a young squad and the fact that we're in the playoffs at all is a damn great achievement.

Our Second and third best players are both under 25 and averaging 11.6/7.5/0.9(60% shooting) and 16/4/2(45%,38%) which means both of them will be hitting their prime in 2-4 years, then we have Enes Kanter and Sabonis. Kanter who is only 24 and averaging 12/8 off the bench will be great addition(if we keep him). Meanwhile Sabonis impresses me the most of all, he's only a rookie and he's looked amazing. 6.3/3.3 may not look like the best stats but when you combine that with the fact thats he's shooting 42% from three, making great passes and playing great defense it makes me think he could be a big part of this team in a few years. We also have Jerami Grant who has been super impressive this year, creating for himself and hitting threes(also a good defender). This is why I'm confused when people call for trades, we aren't in a ""win-now"" mindset. If we let these guys develop we have a truly dangerous team. Westbrook will only be 30-32 at this time and still provide a boost on the scoring end and I imagine will still be a great playmaker. I feel like if we make the playoffs this year that we can really get some much needed experience that will help us in the future.

"#Disclaimer: Im not a BBall Ref savant so this only includes a few stats, also this may seem like a long ass text and it is, so just read if youre interested.

Russell Westbrook currently has made the most field goals in the fourth quarter at 63. To give you a perspective on this, the difference between first and second in field goals made is the same as the difference between second (kemba walker) and 12th (Jordan Clarkson.

In addition to this, Russell Westbrook is 10th in FG% in the fourth quarter, 7th in 3FG% and 11th in eFG%. Russell Westbrook is almost top 10 in all the important shooting stats while also shooting at the highest volume in the league.

This also doesnt take in to account the fact that Westbrook is the focus of the opposing teams defense and isn't accompanied by other stars like, KD, Kawhi etc. Russell is 19th in the % of his field goals that were assisted while the aforementioned two feature in the top 10.

As, is the norm Russell runs the Thunder offense, and in the fourth quarter it is no different. The thunder have had 47 assists so far this year in the fourth quarter. And yes, you guessed it, Russell Westbrook accounts for 47 of those. This is more than Chris Paul (almost double, he has 23), Harden (33) and Curry (11) and every other guard in the league.

Also worth noting is that in contrast to last year where the thunder had the most losses when leading in the fourth quarter (second was the 76ers), Russell Westbrook has lead the Thunder to all their 15 wins almost half of which (7) were come from behind victories in the fourth quarter.

Russell Westbrook perhaps may not be king of the last five seconds, but he is certainly King of the Fourth Quarter this year.","Russell Westbrook: King of the Fourth Quarter #Disclaimer: Im not a BBall Ref savant so this only includes a few stats, also this may seem like a long ass text and it is, so just read if youre interested.

"So this is an issue that I've heard a couple of different people (Lowe and others) discuss, but I feel like this season how to define the MVP will matter more than ever. Every post in /r/nba is asking about who should be the MVP has the criteria that the team be at least a 4 seed, but is that the right way to dictate the most ""valuable"" player? Take Durant or Curry for example, by every metric they are having outstanding MVP worthy seasons, but take either one away, and does their team really suffer all that much? Maybe they drop to the 6th or 7th seed? The same argument could be made for Lebron but his absence would definitely be felt more with only two all stars in Kyrie and Love to fall back on. I think the MVP this year should really be given to the player who's absence would really be felt the most (i.e. really the most valuable, not necessarily the best). Take AD, Harden, or Westbrook away from their teams and they are all lottery bound. And I just don't see how you can say a jump for a team from 10th/11th to 5th/6th brought by a single player in the conference is less impactful and not as MVP worthy than a jump from 6th/7th to 3rd/4th.

"When Derrick Rose won the award, the Bulls finished 1st in the Eastern Conference and posted 60 wins. The Thunder currently are 14-8, putting them on pace for 52 wins.

That's not the reason for this post though. I found this stat interesting:

>At season's end, Rose became only the third player since the 1972–73 NBA season to record 2,000 points and 600 assists in a single season. The other two players were LeBron James and Michael Jordan.

Prior to that, Oscar Robertson did it seven times, with Tiny Archibald and John Havlicek doing it twice each.

Why is that important? Russ currently has 249 assists and 683 points through 22 games. Last year, he clocked 843 assists. One key point though, Russ has never scored at least 2,000 points in a season. With 60 games left, he's on pace to score **2,542**!

There is no doubt the NBA will have to strongly consider him to be an MVP candidate, however, the Thunder need to have a good record in the Western Conference. 

I don't have a definitive source to back up this claim, but I heard no player has won the MVP award since the 1976 merger with a record worse than third in their respective conference. 

If Russ continues his pace, I think he could still win the award as low as 4th in the West, but I don't see it going any lower than that. Especially if a team like the Warriors end up getting close to their 73-win record, which by default so many writers will pick a player on their team (Curry or Durant).","Some comparisons to Derrick Rose's 2010-2011 MVP season When Derrick Rose won the award, the Bulls finished 1st in the Eastern Conference and posted 60 wins.

"First of all, excuse me if this doesn't belong here. I shoot be sleeping considering the time that it is where i live but i just need to get this off my chest. I just finished watching BBALLBREAKDOWN's latest [video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-F9pOwPAmk&feature=share) (spoiler alert: he's been a massive Westbrook critic ever since i started watching him)


People here might have seen me responding about this several times. I initially come from a soccer environment but started to love basketball at the age of 12 fastforward and i've been a big follower of the NBA and OKC for a few years now.


Let me come to the point: basketball fans seem to only use stats when judging everything and they completely abuse them in literally every discussion just to back their argument, whether relevant or not. In soccer, this seems not as relevant but that's not what i want to talk about.


It has been there for as long as i know but this season, for me at least, it has gotten way too infuriating. The thing is, all Westbrook haters seem to run the argument: **""RUSSELL IS ONLY ABOUT STATS!! STATPADDER""** etc. etc. continued by something like ""he doesn't actually want to pass only if he gets assists, look 7 turnovers!"" Or ""He shot 17/44!!"" 
To me, this seems like the most hypocritical thing there is right? Like you try to talk down a player because hes all about stats, but you are actually the one who continues to bring up stats? I might be wrong here but i feel like that is the red flag of someone who hasn't watched a single game of us.


I don't know if im actually making sense or anything, please let me know. I just wanted to write this a vent some of my anger, sorry for the long post.

","The stats circlejerk. First of all, excuse me if this doesn't belong here. I shoot be sleeping considering the time that it is where i live but i just need to get this off my chest. I just finished watching BBALLBREAKDOWN's latest [video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-F9pOwPAmk&feature=share) (spoiler alert: he's been a massive Westbrook critic ever since i started watching him)


People here might have seen me responding about this several times. I initially come from a soccer environment but started to love basketball at the age of 12 fastforward and i've been a big follower of the NBA and OKC for a few years now.


Let me come to the point: basketball fans seem to only use stats when judging everything and they completely abuse them in literally every discussion just to back their argument, whether relevant or not. In soccer, this seems not as relevant but that's not what i want to talk about.


It has been there for as long as i know but this season, for me at least, it has gotten way too infuriating. The thing is, all Westbrook haters seem to run the argument: **""RUSSELL IS ONLY ABOUT STATS!! STATPADDER""** etc. etc. continued by something like ""he doesn't actually want to pass only if he gets assists, look 7 turnovers!"" Or ""He shot 17/44!!"" 
To me, this seems like the most hypocritical thing there is right? Like you try to talk down a player because hes all about stats, but you are actually the one who continues to bring up stats? I might be wrong here but i feel like that is the red flag of someone who hasn't watched a single game of us.

I am crying out for your help and advice. I will be in Latrobe, PA, near Pittsburgh for the next academic semester. On the very top of my bucketlist is to attend an OKC game. I kind of gave up on the hope of attending a home game, because money and school, but I am still hoping to go to a nearby NBA city for an away game. This might be the closest I'll ever be in my life to any NBA city, so I really don't want to miss this opportunity. I ask for your advice regarding which city to choose (Cleveland?, Philly?, Washington?, or something else?), and since I really don't know, I would even welcome advice regarding mass transportation, what the best way is to go, and which city you'd recommend.

Köszönöm!","Help out a Hungarian fan! Fellow Thunder fans!
I am crying out for your help and advice. I will be in Latrobe, PA, near Pittsburgh for the next academic semester. On the very top of my bucketlist is to attend an OKC game. I kind of gave up on the hope of attending a home game, because money and school, but I am still hoping to go to a nearby NBA city for an away game. This might be the closest I'll ever be in my life to any NBA city, so I really don't want to miss this opportunity. I ask for your advice regarding which city to choose (Cleveland?, Philly?, Washington?, or something else?), and since I really don't know, I would even welcome advice regarding mass transportation, what the best way is to go, and which city you'd recommend. Also how you recommend buying the ticket. nbatickets.com? resellers? any piece of advice and information is welcome, even if you think it is an evidence. It will probably be valuable info for me.

""The league has started tracking 'potential assists,' which count not only the passes that led to field goals, but also the passes that would have led to made baskets, if, you know, a teammate had made the basket. Over the past seven games, no player has had more potential assists than Russell Westbrook, with 164; Harden has more actual assists in that time, though. Russ is out here messing with geometry, bending the court into a dodecahedron in an effort to spoon-feed his teammates, yet there are still too many points left off the board. Westbrook is changing history with every second he’s out on the floor, but his situation consistently demands newer, higher levels of excellence. He’s made it his duty to oblige. It’s wondrous and troubling all the same.""","Westbrook and the potential assist Enjoyed this piece by Danny Chau in the Ringer's ""The NBA’s Kings of the Court, One Month In"" - http://bit.ly/2fxHFt9

"I know we have all been a little heartbroken lately, and I thought we should bring some positivity back to our sub. This is gonna be a little corny, but shit, it's the holidays. Let's cheese it up.

So today, I'm thankful for Russell ""GOAT"" Westbrook. I'm so happy this guy decided to stick with us (even if it's temporary). He is one of the best players in the NBA currently, and will go down in history as one of the greats. I'm so thankful I get to witness his legacy in the making and I'm thankful that he's playing for us. This dude cares about the community and his teammates and that's amazing to have.

I'm thankful for every player on our team. I love that they come out every night to put it all on the line and make us proud. 

Dipo-I love how fast he's adapted to our team, and I'm very excited to see him continue to grow and become an all star playing with us. He's been really hitting his stride and it's exciting!

Adams-I love his mentality on the court and off. Dude always sees the positives. And I love that he can take a massive beating every single night and still come out and play hard. Also, baseball passes and his hook shot. Love it.

Sabonis-I'm thankful for how much this guy has been able to completely change his style of play to fit with us. He seems like he enjoys every minute of being on the court and I'm very excited to watch him develop.

Roberson-I'm thankful that this guy works so hard on defense and never gives up. His defense on screens is super impressive and something that gets overlooked sometimes. 

Morrow-I love that this dude has finally earned himself some significant minutes. He looks confident out there even if his shots haven't been falling as much as we'd like. That's a great thing. I'm excited to watch him this season.

Collison-I've been a fan of his since the thunder moved to OKC. Upstanding guy and a positive influence on our young guys. Hope he finishes his career with us and makes it into the OK HOF.

Payne-I love this dude. Maybe it's the dances, or his positive attitude, or his hair. Idk. But this dude is one of my favorite players. I look forward to watching him grow this season and in future seasons!

Kanter-this guy is funny as shit. I'm thankful for his based tweets. Guy has gone through so much shit and still keeps a positive attitude. Love watching him make shots that other centers can't and providing our bench with the scoring it needs.

Grant-I love this trade! While I was excited for Ersan, I'm super happy we got Grant. Dude is a monster on the court. Slam dunks and blocked shots. Dude is a beast.

Abrines-I'm glad we picked up Alex as well. Guy had a great 3 shot in Spain, and I think by the end of this season he's gonna be raining them down anytime he's on the court. Guy is fun to watch too. He's a little rough around the edges but you can tell he's giving it 100% when he's out there. There have been a times when he plays great defense but the opponent's shot still sinks somehow. But then the next possession Abrines is right back in his face, never giving up. That's what I love to see the most.

Lauvergne-I'm a big fan of Joffrey's. Not only does he share a name with my favorite evil prince, he also is one of the most underrated players on our roster. He can play defense. He can sink the 3. He can block shots. And he really gets into the game mentally. He's gonna be a big part moving forward. Definitely thankful we have him on the roster.

Singler-Oh Singler. What more is there to say than he's the GOAT? In all honesty though, I enjoy it when I see his face pop up on the screen. He gets a lot of hate, but he gives it his all when he's on the court. And he's the driving force behind so many memes. Gotta love the guy for that.

Christon-I gotta be thankful for this guy. He's fresh and playing his first NBA games ever. Dude killed it in the D League and earned himself a spot on our roster. He was thrust into the backup PG role early on in his first NBA season. And while he looks like a rookie, he has shown us some good things. He has a really nice pull up jumper. And he can make the shot even with a guy playing close D on him. I like this dude.

Huestis-I know the least about this guy, but I'm thankful to have him on our team. He shows up at the team events and gives back to our community often. I hope he gains some minutes this year just so I can see what he can do.

All in all, I'm very thankful. We have one of the best fanbases in the NBA. Billy D is a fantastic coach. Sam Presti is an amazing GM. This sub and our fan base and our home crowd are all great. It's an amazing thing to be a part of this team.

I know this was a corny post, but let me know what you're thankful for! ","In the spirit of thanksgiving, what are some things you are thankful for regarding our team?

"Our offense is clearly a problem, our shooting isn't as bad as people say but teams still pack the paint against us. They did it when we had Durant, that's the team we have. However, this year we either have

A) People who can't shoot(Roberson)

B) People who can shoot, but not well.(Roberson from corner, Semaj, etc..)

C) People who can shoot but are inconsistent(Oladipo)

D) Rookies who are not given attention regardless if they make it or not and are still adjusting(Sabonis, Abrines)

Shit, talk about icing vs switching on defense. Fill free to pose your own questions as well. It doesn't have to be about our shooting/offense. 

Personally I think it will get better naturally, if Sabonis remains consistent teams will start to respect his shot, if Oladipo keeps it up I think teams will respect him(I don't expect him to shoot 50% but 38% from 3 is doable). Hopefully Abrines gets out of his slump. Westbrook seems improved. 

That's why i think it will get marginally better, especially with Payne coming back.

Last year we had the same problem in regular season where donovan gave unreasonable minutes to crap player such as singler. It seemed to get better in playoffs but this season it is the same shit again. 

Last game Kanter was having the best defensive game of his OKC career. And it was not against opponent bench player, he played with the starters against pacers starters. This is the first time I saw kanter able to defend pick&rolls and perimeter. And I am not talking about ""ehh he did a okay job"", he was solid. They tried to target him on pick&rolls that did not work, next they tried to switch guards to him and he even defended those. So pacers basically stopped targeting him. He actually has the stats for that, 3 blocks and 1 steal plus his normal 16 pts and 3 assist and 4 rebounds. I though Donovan also saw this since he played for an above average 25 mins. But as we approached to the end of the 4th quarter he took him out and put Lauvergne in. Funny thing is, advance stats show lauvergnes defense to be a inferior to kanters. Lauvergne is much more mobile, but thats impact on defense is non existent, plus he has a stupid habit of jumping on teammates for garbing rebounds, causing the ball to bounce to the opposition.

**Game notes:**


Thunder hype is back in full swing after taking 2 wins in a row it's time for us to play the Pacers. Pacers shut down the defending NBA champions this week (well they sat LBJ so it doesn't really count) and then turned around to get shut down themselves by the Suns. Plagued with multiple injuries tonight the Pacers are looking pretty rough without their scoring champion and their 2 best options from the arc. Similarly to the Thunder, the Pacers have a strong starting line up and struggles when their bench comes on the court. If Olidepo can keep swinging like he has been and we can feed the low post I believe this game will be ours. Otherwise we will struggle if we can't play the matchups well with our bench. Westbrook is and easy answer to Jeff Teague. Leave a comment that says ""ayyo"" if anyone is actually reading this shit so I can know if I'm wasting my fucking time. Our SF match up this game would have been our weakest link against a healthy Pacers team however with potentially both their star SFs out tonight it looks to be one of our strong suits. Rebounds and second chances will be another easy exploit for OKC tonight so look to Kanter and Adams (if his hand isn't fucking with his game) to have a huge impact tonight.

Fluff aside, let's get back to Basketball. After snapping a grueling loosing streak Wednesday, OKC host the Nets tonight. Jeromy Lin may be sitting out with a hamstring injury which, for lack of a better pun, is linsanely disappointing to me. The nets are under the tutelage of a new coach Kenny Atkinson who has proven to be an effective X&O guy as well as being very popular with the team. While not playing amazingly I think most people have been impressed by their showing this year despite only having Lin for 5 games. Tonight should be an easy win for the home squad though we should keep an eye on Brook Lopez and Trevor Booker. That's really all I have, I've yet to see a Nets game this year so I'm excited.

**Game notes:**


As stated above, Harden is having an amazing start to the season putting up historic stats in the early part of the season. Personally outside of Westbrook, Harden was my second favorite Thunder player back in the day, convincing me to grow a beard before I probably should have. I love watching his stylistic play, his handles, his release. He's a joy to watch. Aside from him, Ryan Anderson is having a great year so far and we will be forced to keep an eye on this duo from the 3. While Houston is strong on offense we should be able to effectively shut down their inside game as the Adams/Capela match up is pretty lopsided as far as defensive presence, hopefully Adams hand being wrapped doesn't effect his ability to pull down some defensive boards for us. Likewise we should be able to use some low post moves to get some easy points on the other end of the court assuming we can complete a damn pass. I recapped on the games I missed this week and the common problem I noticed was a complete lack of ability to pass and catch these easy looks, hopefully Billy D whipped them into shape for tonight.

"Just wondering you guys could give me some insight on this guy. r/NBA mocks his screaming of ""AND ONE!"", but has he always done this? It seems he's overly focused on going to the line and just barrelling in without much forethought, his layups are often terribly flat, he doesn't seem to have a soft touch. It's frustrating watching someone do all the hard work only to not convert most of the time, I think he's too focused on looking for the foul, as such the refs stop giving him the rub of it. Refs dislike being told how to do their job.

Just wondering what more we can expect from ""Kobe Wade"". His dynamism is welcome, but that ego is not. Last night he took an off balance three when we were 3 points down at the end of the fourth. 5.9 seconds to go, two guys were open, both better shooters than Dion right now, and he took a running three with multiple defenders mobbing him. It was ugly as fuck, I can't handle that level of boneheadery two nights in a row - Last night he had the most FG attempts, but only scored 9 points to the 19 for our leaders in scoring, Hassan Whiteside and Josh Richardson.

I've been defending the guy in every thread, I love his dynamism and he's still the biggest steal of the off season for me, but it's getting harder with him hoisting up losing shots. He was on 29 or something mad against the Spurs, I know they can fall, but his Assist game has got to grow. He attracts a lot of attention and should really switch it up when they aren't falling, find that rhythmn another way.","Has Dion always been a poor finisher?

"We know that kanter is an efficient scorer and his offensive skills are close elite level. However, like any other center, his offensive game depends on and limited by the pg he is playing with.

I'm sorry if this was brought up in another thread, but I came to ask a question.  With Oladipos 4 year 84 mil extension and Fournier's 5 year 85 mil contract, would you have rather traded for him or Oladipo?  Obviously, this is in hindsight and they both bring different things to the table.

"Steph, Klay and KD all have 30 (*KD w/29 cuz he sucks) and win comfortably.

Russ has 41 pts, 16 ast, and 12 reb while OKC comes back from a 21 pt 2nd quarter deficit to make Ibaka's homecoming an actual contest, but ultimately fall short in close 119-117 loss. 

Comparing this ""Tale of Two NBA Games"" makes me realize how *thankful* I am to be an OKC fan right now knowing every time we play I'll get to see our monster of a superstar and top 5 player in Russell Westbrook lead this young, exciting group of guys to make sure OKC is at least a competitive team in this league. Each and every game we always have the chance to see an unestablished guy like Sabonis, Abrines, Grant, Lauvergne, or Semaj step up and contribute. We also always get to see the more established but still developing guys like Adams, Kanter, Oladipo, and Roberson find and then hopefully thrive in their place in the OKC machine. 

When I try to put myself in the shoes of a Warriors fan, it just doesn't seem that fun. Sure, every night I'll probably see a win. Every night I'll know that 4 All Stars, 2 of them league MVPs, along with a Finals MVP 6th man will be pretty hard to stop for most other teams. Just seems kind of boring though if I pretty much know what's gonna happen already. 

TL;DR: If I were a Warriors fan I'd be excited to watch only a handful of games throughout the season but otherwise I'd be bored until the playoffs, and even then I'd probably be bored until the WCF. **As a Thunder fan, I'm excited to watch every single game we play.** ","Warriors blow Suns out.

"**Russ** - obviously he's getting voted in and will most likely be a starter. He was the MVP in 2015 and 2016, being the first player since Bob Petit to win it consecutively (1958 & 1959). This means if Russ wins it again in 2017, he will be the first to do so in All-Star history, and will join an elite list of players (Shaquille O'Neal, Michael Jordan and Oscar Robertson) to win it three times. Only Petit and Kobe Bryant have four All-Star MVPs to their name.

**Kanter** - I was looking for information on a total of NBA All Star voting, and the first source I found showed me that unbeknownst to me, [Kanter was #7 among Fontcourt players in the West](http://www.basketball-reference.com/allstar/NBA_2016_voting.html), with 534,499 votes. He received more votes than Lamarcus Aldridge, Andre Drummond and Anthony Davis, all of which played in the [2016 game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_NBA_All-Star_Game). We know that voting is open to the world, which explains why Yao Ming was able to get voted #1 when everyone and their dog in China was voting for him. It's possible that a lot of Kanter's votes (hell, who am I kidding, probably all of them) came from people in Turkey or Turkish-Americans. 

Kanter was #11 overall among Western Conference players. This is probably the high ceiling for him, so I don't see him getting the automatic bid to get an All-Star spot, although it's interesting to note that he is getting this kind of attention. There are a few other Turkish players in the NBA, but Kanter is the most popular.

(What's even crazier, is the top 10 features five current Warriors: Curry, Klay, Green, Durant and Pachulia. I'm sure there's some idiot out there crossing his fingers that the entire 2017 Western All-Star starting team is the Warriors).

**Adams** - to my point above about Kanter, this is why I started thinking about the All Star Game. Adams is now the [highest-paid athlete in New Zealand](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=11739823) in their nation's history, and it's not even close. He's got to be a household name there by now. His popularity has certainly surged in the U.S. after getting kicked in the nuts by the mouth-breathing donkey, but I have a friend in NZ who tells me the nutkick was the top story on their national news when it happened. 

Based on last year, the threshold is 782,339 votes at the third spot for the West frontcourt given to Kawhi Leonard. Is it possible, given that Kanter was able to manage more than 500k, that Adams could get enough to be a default starting spot? Otherwise, without that, I don't see him getting in. To put that in perspective, only three players got at least one million votes (Lebron, Kobe and Curry). 

There are just under 5 million people in NZ, yet there are 78 million in Turkey. In perspective, Pachulia got 726k votes, and the ~~Argentenian population is 43 million~~ Georgian population is 4 million. ~~However, you're talking about ""The Land Down Under.""~~ Throw that in with his new-found, balls-of-steel popularity in the U.S. (I mean, my God, that FT%?!) and his love of cartoons, I guess it's possible.

Not exactly sure how many Adams received last year, but the lowest person on the list I found was Harrison Barnes with ~150,000 votes. Anyone have the full vote count?","Looking ahead to the All-Star Game (yeah, I'm THAT guy) **Russ** - obviously he's getting voted in and will most likely be a starter.

He hustles down the court and with the defender in his face and with 4.5/4.6 seconds on the clock he pulls up. That was enough time to get from the basket to the three point line so are you gonna honestly tell me it wasn't enough time to drive to the hoop. Now look at the positioning, it's likely Westbrook could of blown by his defender and of been left with two options. Driving straight ahead into Blake Griffin, or driving past him and pulling for a midrange. In the first case it's likely you either earn freethrows or make the shot. In the second case, Jamal would of jumped out to contest leaving Sabonis for a three. Had he of not then Westbrook would of had a nearly uncontested Midrange. Terrible shot selection.

**Game Notes:**


After many an upvote party it's time that the leaders of the western conference once again assert their dominance over the league. Miami has a lot of similarities to OKC this year, both teams are in a rebuilding year after loosing some key role players including tragically on of my favorite players in the league Chris Bosh. Keep an eye on Hassan Whiteside as he is a monster and a tough match up for Adams if he's on his A game. We will also see Dion Waiters return tonight who should recieve a round of applause from his favorite ol team. And obviously Dragic is good or whatever.

Tip off is at 7:00 and can be viewed on FSOK and SUN. Streams are always available on /r/NBAStreams for all you cord cutters and don't forget to join the conversation on our Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/fcnTDFs)

"We can probably agree that the Thunder as presently constructed cannot win a title this season. Are there any shooters who are borderline allstars (or flat out allstars) that you can see the Thunder trading for in order to push themselves into the upper echelon with the Clippers, Spurs and (in a galaxy far, far away) the Warriors? 

Some names I'm throwing around in my head so far: 

Anthony Davis - F - NO - The Pelicans are 0-6 and Anthony Davis has already voiced his frustrations about wanting to go to a contender or at least a team that can win. He's been linked to the NYK for a Porzingis/Rose swap, but I don't think that would be enough to get it done honestly. I need to actually sit down and figure out how the Thunder even make this deal happen, but I don't know why AD wouldn't want to play with Russell F***ing Westbrook... And I think an argument can be made that the pair would push them to a contender status even this year. Normally I wouldn't suggest that OKC just get another big but this is different in that he can score at will like pretty much any other player on the floor and he can space the floor as well. Steven Adams may have to go if this were to go down. They also just lost Lance Stephenson for an indefinite amount of time, and we could probably give Dipo as part of a deal. 

Kentavious Caldwell-Pope - G - DET - Now this one is interesting for a few different reasons. He hasn't necessarily been talked about as a trade component but after not getting an extension done before the deadline last week, Van Gundy said that is was ""not the end of the world"" that they didn't extend him and that may have pissed KCP off. 

Doug McDermott - F - CHI - Ah, Dougie McBuckets. The sniper from Creighton. Over the summer, his name was leaked as part of a potential offer along with Valentine to the Sixers for Okafor potentially. No deal ultimately went down but I think OKC has some interesting parts to offer for the young shooter. He is also an instant upgrade over Singler or Morrow in my opinion. This move may not put the Thunder up there with the other squads but it would still be a vast improvement. 

Rudy Gay - F - SAC - This has been out there forever now. OKC has had interest in Gay for a long time and I think they will try to strike eventually this season and see if they can find an offer that fits both teams' liking.

"Ok guys. I'm stoned and have wanted to share this idea I've had for awhile now. It's Friday, I ain't got shit to do, so here goes.

I don't know how many of you are familiar with the anime ""Naruto,"" but it recently concluded its television series and since then I've been rewatching it from the beginning (if you haven't watch it, I'd recommend it). Anyway, anyone knows the story will know where I'm coming from, but if you don't I'll fill it in for you.

Naruto has two main character, Uzumaki Naruto and Uchiha Sasuke. Both characters start as best friends, on the same team, and together they becoming strong and closer. Later in the story, there's an event called the ""Chunin Exams."" In them, Sasuke gets a taste of a new type of strength, one he covets henceforth. He eventually leaves the village they both reside in to join this power, and the rest of the story involves Naruto trying to bring him back.

This anime draws striking parallels to what's going on on the Oklahoma City Thunder. We have Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, both starting on the same team and spending years together becoming better basketball players. But, in 2012, at the Olympics, Kevin got a taste of what it might be like to play a different brand of basketball. It's fair to say that since then, he too has coveted this new asset, and now were present day where he's actually left the village, OKC, to go get it. 

Westbrook is Naruto. He's a man of the people, a man who unifies those around him and who get them to work with him, as a team, and as a friend. Kevin is Sasuke, who left because of his perpetual rivalry with his best friend Westbrook made him want to compete with him, to finally realize which of the two are better, to find a new strength.

If even one of you reading this understands where I'm coming from, then it was worth sharing this. If this story of Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook is to continue on its parallel path, then we can expect many, maaaaany more great clashes between them. This rivalry is what the Post-Lebron era of the NBA will need (not to say we're there yet).. It'll be center stage. I'm thankful to get to watch this story play out with you guys, even if sometimes it totally sucks.

Hope everyone has a great weekend and God bless. Thanks for reading my rambling.","Uzumaki Westbrook Ok guys. I'm stoned and have wanted to share this idea I've had for awhile now. It's Friday, I ain't got shit to do, so here goes.

"No doubt that this game hurt, but the following are a couple of things that are keeping my spirits from crashing and burning.

**Jerami Grant:**  After watching both the Clippers and GSW game, Jerami Grant looks like he has some potential.  Originally I thought the trade was solely for cap space for a potential trade.  Instead, I am hopeful of his contribution as a solid three for this year.

**Youngins:** While watching the Clippers game, there were stretches where all five players on the floor never played in a Thunder uniform before.  For shooters, Sobanis / Abrines have the potential to be a go-to corner three after being more accustomed to playing in the NBA.  In addition, I feel like there are more things we can do with Oladipo with either our bigs or Westbrook.  In conclusion, the fact that there are periods of time where any of our new players get me excited is always a nice perk.

**Cameron Payne:** Our back-up point-guard who will be running the second unit is not back yet.  The contribution that he will provide in running an offense in the second unit will give Westbrook chances of resting.

**Sam Presti:** Like I said before, I still think the trade for Jerami Grant is one of the many steps Presti will make in providing for us a consistent scorer (preferably shooter).  With the trade on Tuesday, we receive a trade exception and cap space.

**Beginning of the Season:**  Clearly an obvious point, but cannot be stressed enough.  Westbrook is facilitating the offense and creating open shots and opportunities with his teammates.  Unfortunately, I think each of the members of our team are not confident enough to either take the shot or make the correct play (opting for safety).  I believe this will change as the season progresses and players are more confident in their shot.

"Hear me out guys, I know some of you won't like this but listen to my reasons:

What do yall think about moving Oladipo to the bench in place of Abrines? I know Abrines is a rookie and isn't a starting quality player YET, but it would hide his defensive deficiencies since he'd be playing alongside Robes/Adams/Russ and give us some spacing since Oladipo is predominately a slasher (like Russ).

and

Christon/Payne (when healthy)-Oladipo-Morrow/Singler-Kanter/Grant-Lauvergne off the bench.

**Game notes:**

Aww yis, today is the day. Obviosuly the big story is the years first battle between GOAT and Cupcake. Tip off at 9:30 central in the Oracle, national broadcast on TNT! It's time to think of your excuse to call in sick to work so you can nurse your hangover and lost voice. It's time to Thunder the fuck up! 


Aside from the main story, the Thunder are 4-0 in the second game of a back to back road trip. Fatigue will obviously be a factor though luckily both road games have been relatively close. Both teams are going to put all their effort into walking away with the win. Both teams have not been so easy on the eyes as far as gameplay goes with the Thunder struggling on offense and the Warriors not yet meeting the expectations of a team of their caliber. Vegas has the Warriors by 11.5, though Vegas is quickly learning when you assume something about the Thunder you're going to have a bad time. Only time will tell.

Aside from all eyes being on the Westbrook/KD drama, keep an eye on Billy Donovan playing some unique line ups we haven't seen yet this year with a focus of defensive stops and rebounding. Klay Thompson will be an interesting player to watch as his 3pt shooting has been atrocious so far this year, Im personally almost as excited to see the Klay/Victor, Roberson/Durant match up as well as the Pachuila/Adams showdown down low.

For me this is our real first test of the season, coming off of 3 straight wins we get our first look at a 1st tier (or 2nd depending on who you ask) team. Chris Paul and Westbrook is one of my favorite match ups to watch assuming Doc Rivers puts Paul on Westbrook which isn't guaranteed. The real head scratcher is who the hell will guard Blake Griffin. My only thought would be Roberson but the size mismatch is real. Vegas has the Clippers by 5.5, so only time will tell if we are going to stand up to the challenge or crumble under the pressure. 

We will also get our first look at Jerami Grant in a Thunder uniform after a bizarre early season trade. Keep an eye out for his defensive presence and be more patient than you guys were with Victor Olidepo!

My only thought would be Roberson but the size mismatch is real. Vegas has the Clippers by 5.5, so only time will tell if we are going to stand up to the challenge or crumble under the pressure. 

We will also get our first look at Jerami Grant in a Thunder uniform after a bizarre early season trade. Keep an eye out for his defensive presence and be more patient than you guys were with Victor Olidepo!

I've read about how Jack Sikma (great player to be honest), won Seattle a ring back in 1979, how Mutombo managed to beat Payton and Kemp in an unbelievable win with the Nuggets, on how KD came into the league, managed to take the team to the Finals a few years back and I've also read about how we had incredible players such as Jack Sikma, Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp, Ray Allen and atm the man that everybody loves -- Russell Westbrook.

But still, I don't feel like I know a lot about the team's history. I'm constantly trying and learn more and more about NBA history (as well as OKC history), but I'd love it if you guys can give me some nice facts that I might not know if I read about OKC on Wikipedia.

"Does this trade interest you guys at all? Blazers and Thunder both seem like teams that want to make trades (since our cap spaces will be tied up for a while), and I feel like this helps us both.

Kanter would become our starter instead of a backup on your team behind Adams (who clearly management loves) and since none of our bigs play defense anyway, getting a really nice offensive player would be good for us (we can't count on Ezeli being healthy)

For you guys, I think Aminu is exactly what you want. He's a defensive 3/4 with an okay (36%) 3 point shot, though he's quite streaky.

"Hey, Mavs Fan here 

Now as the extension talks of Oladipo and Adams have leaked I have seen some Thunder fans being not sure if 80+ million for Oladipo is a good signing going forward. 

As far as I can see from an outside perspective, your team lacks some shooting in the backcourt and some defense. 

The Mavericks have several good shooters, but lack a slashing guard who can collapse the defense. 

Wesley Matthews' number have dropped significantly after his torn achilles, but he looks way more mobile and athletic than last year. He still plays lockdown defense (watch him guard Harden in the game last night) and he has great work ethic. Dallas has a problem of creating space for the shooters and that's why we often settle for contested (3-)jumpers late in the shotclock.

We lost KD and Ibaka, they've lost Kobe so tonight we will see two teams on the road to rebuilding their respective franchises. 

Though it's still very early in the season, The Thunder have struggled to play in a good flow at the beginning of both games played shooting 11/43 from the 3 pt. line (25.6%) though by comparison The warriors are 16/61 (or 26.2%). They've also struggled with transition offense, connecting passing lanes and with fouls and turnovers. Hopefully tonight we will see some smarter gameplay and more concise play execution.

You can catch the game at 6:00pm on FSOK, or check out /r/NBAstreams for alternative sources.

"I keep hearing this, even among Thunder fans (the cynical ones).

First, I gotta say, as a life-long NBA fan, these first two games have been some of the most entertaining basketball outings I can remember in October/November. 

Watching that fat Philly fan flip off Westbrook. Learning that Steven Adams watches cartoons instead of NBA games. Seeing Westbrook almost get a triple-double in the first-half of the Phoenix game. Both games coming down to the wire, and ending gloriously triumphant. 

**ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?**

I digress.

But this notion that Philadelphia and Phoenix ""suck"" and ""are shit"" is the first thing a cynic throws out, because they are committing the cardinal sin of a foolish betting man: *using past performance to indicate future results*.

My response: how do you know the Suns and 76ers won't make the playoffs this year?

Of course it's met with laughter and scoffing. Then I ask for them to name players on the teams. I dare you. I double dare you. 

*Uh, I think the Sixers have that guy from Kansas, the one who was injured a lot. Is Nash still in Phoenix? I don't know*

Next, go down a list of your top 8 teams the East and West, and then compare those rosters to the Suns and Sixers. Sure, we're spending *a lot* of time here on semantics, what ifs, who cares, he will get injureds, etc.

They don't know. 

No one knows.

The next criticism of this team is that Russ is a ""ball hog."" ""He's selfish."" ""He shoots too much.""

Uh...remember when they had Kevin Durant and this was the same critique? Now that KD is gone, can you blame Russ for being these alleged things?

No. You can't. No one can. The man is a triple-double machine, and is poised to become [the mother-flippin' MVP](http://ima.ulximg.com/public/userfiles/2016/08/Cp7Da5cXEAA-AUI.jpg).

My suggestion? Buckle up, buckaroos.

"So I figured it'd be cool to make my post game analysis a tradition.

Obviously the big story is the first 50+ pt x3x2 since KAJ, Westbrook is a god.

Let's talk coherent defense, how does it work, what does it do? The league now knows how to beat the Thunder. Drive to the paint until you pull a man off for a double team then kick it out the the guy picking his nose wide open on the perimeter. This shit can't go on like this, Thursday is going to be fucking rough. I know Billy D knows his Xs and Os so the problem is our player bbiq. It'll obviously get better but this is our 2nd game in a row to be saved by a clutch block from Roberson.

On to the positives, Roberson. Fuck yeah. Two clutch last second blocks in a row. Fuck yeah. Olidepo, fuck yeah. Much better example of what he can do for us on offense. Adams, meh, solid game but you're clumsy as fuck my man! Stop feeding these bullet passes to him when he's doesn't have his footing or a good look otherwise rebounding was crucial to us pulling this out. Now I'm going to say it, trigger warning, Kyle Singles is a good player. He was +21 and shut down TJ Warren which is no easy task for one of 2015s worst players in the league. My man can't make them but he's getting solid open looks and it really giving it his all. YOU GUYS LEAVE KYLE ALONE.

All in all despite the amazing Westbrook numbers and the exciting game/win I'm scared as fuck for this line up. This is the SECOND game in a row we've pulled a victory out of our ass with >42% shooting. I know it's still early in the season and tomorrow's sports center will tout this win as a ""Historic Westbrook numbers victory"" but the whole game was shit and you should feel bad.

2nd:	Brandon Knight

3rd:	Tyler Ulis


* SHOOTING GUARD


START:	Devin Booker

2nd:	Leandro Barbosa

3rd:	John Jenkins

3rd:	Dragan Bender


* CENTER

START:	Tyson Chandler

2nd:	Alex Len

3rd:	Alan Williams


**Game notes:**

Coming home after an ugly win over the 76ers, Thunder fans will have their first look at a game in The Peak. This is also the first time Oklahoma gets to show their appreciation for Russell Westbrook's contract extension. We will see tonight if the lack of cohesion we saw on Wednesday was a fluke or a real issue for this new set of Thunder players.

Pheonix will be our second of three 3rd tier teams to start the season before we face the Warriors. While they're not the best team in the league, they are a talented and very young team with a majority of players in their early to mid 20s. Tyson Chandler (2012 defensive player of the year) will prove  another difficult match up for Steven Adams who had his work cut out for him last game guarding the breakout rookie Joel Embiid. 

Victor Olidepo is my player to watch this game, not because I expect an amazing performance but because while he left a lot to be desired last game tonight is a better match up for him. For anyone who didnt follow him in Orlando, you need to realize that while he is a good player, inconsistency has plagued him throughout his career. I expect him to show Thunder fans more of what he can do tonight and maybe even hopefully have a breakout game.

"So it's 4:55am, I can't sleep so I thought I'd share some things I noticed about the first round of games after watching most of them.

1.) You can really tell who doesn't really watch a full season on Reddit by people jumping to conclusions after one game. I.e. Signing KD was a mistake, KAT is overrated, AD is going to be MVP, Olidepo sucks etc. give it time.

2.) AD is going to be MVP. Seriously though he's out of NOLA ASAP, what a beast.

3.) Everyone but the Spurs and the Cavs are off to an ugly start as far as Xs and Os look. Well not everyone but these two teams are the only teams I saw that looked fully functional on game one.

As for the Thunder here's who I give a gold star to:

* Westbrook (obviously)

* Kanter (seems like his second chance reads have improved more this year) 

* Roberson (amazing footwork, defensive IQ and showing confidence on offense)

* Sabonis (Impressive first real look at him on the team in a real game, has good IQ and helpful on the glass)

* Ilyasova (Another first look at a new player on the team, played hard and well)

* Embiid (alright not on our team but fuck, this is a guy to watch this year)


Silver stars go to:

* Adams (played well but had some foul issues and some clumsy turnovers typical of big men, seemed to be afraid to get an offensive rebound)

* Singler (the bars so fucking low for him after last year anything positive will get my attention, but he seems to be more confident as well as more trusted by team mates. He found himself with some good looks and even made a few. High five Kyle)

* Collison (didn't play but today was his ~~30th~~ 36th birthday)



Anyway nobody cares just passing time while watching Netflix

1.) You can really tell who doesn't really watch a full season on Reddit by people jumping to conclusions after one game. I.e. Signing KD was a mistake, KAT is overrated, AD is going to be MVP, Olidepo sucks etc. give it time.

2.) AD is going to be MVP. Seriously though he's out of NOLA ASAP, what a beast.

3.) Everyone but the Spurs and the Cavs are off to an ugly start as far as Xs and Os look. Well not everyone but these two teams are the only teams I saw that looked fully functional on game one.

As for the Thunder here's who I give a gold star to:

* Westbrook (obviously)

* Kanter (seems like his second chance reads have improved more this year) 

* Roberson (amazing footwork, defensive IQ and showing confidence on offense)

* Sabonis (Impressive first real look at him on the team in a real game, has good IQ and helpful on the glass)

* Ilyasova (Another first look at a new player on the team, played hard and well)

* Embiid (alright not on our team but fuck, this is a guy to watch this year)


Silver stars go to:

* Adams (played well but had some foul issues and some clumsy turnovers typical of big men, seemed to be afraid to get an offensive rebound)

* Singler (the bars so fucking low for him after last year anything positive will get my attention, but he seems to be more confident as well as more trusted by team mates. He found himself with some good looks and even made a few. High five Kyle)

* Collison (didn't play but today was his ~~30th~~ 36th birthday)



Anyway nobody cares just passing time while watching Netflix

"[Brief note: I'm a Sixers fan, and wrote most of this right after Westbrook signed back with you guys. I was reminded of my love for him tonight, so I decided to finish it and polish it up a little. Hope you enjoy.]

“And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy…
And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.
And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, ‘Who is like unto the beast? Who is able to make war with him?’” –Revelations 13:1, 3-4

&nbsp;

“Who is like unto the beast? Who is able to make war with him?” Behold, as I am become Russell Westbrook, destroyer of ankles and rims.  By blood, I will cleanse the league of sin, and tear the basketball world asunder.  Only then, shall the league be free. 

This upcoming season, Russell Westbrook will be a man on a mission.  It isn’t one of mercy. It’s one of revenge. 

The Oklahoma City Thunder have gone from perennial title threats to little more than an afterthought in the minds of pundits and fans alike.  Kevin Durant, near unanimously considered one of the best 5 players in the NBA, left his franchise in free agency this summer to join rivals Golden State Warriors, a team who the Thunder held a 3-1 game lead on in this year’s Western Conference finals.  Debate continues to rage over this cataclysmic event in the competitive balance of the NBA, but there is a growing scientific consensus that it was, to use academic parlance, “A Bitch Ass Move.”

This was a devastating blow to the Thunder and, more importantly, to Russell Westbrook.  Speculation around Russell Westbrook’s impending free agency arose after Durant’s departure, and a number of teams inquired on his availability (most notably the Celtics and Lakers). But, Russell Westbrook the saint, Russell Westbrook the martyr, RUSSGOAT BESTDICK DA GAWD has just signed a 3-year extension in Oklahoma City, and in one swift move saved Thunder fans from a gruesome rebuilding process (and collective suicide).

This next season of basketball is going to be an entertaining one.  If you subscribe to the philosophy that every story is only as good as its villain (see: The Dark Knight being the best Batman), this next season of basketball will be one of the greatest ever.  The Warriors went from America’s darlings to bona fide villains so fast: Steph’s mouth guard outburst was a tantrum that bordered on childish, and it doesn’t help that he looks like he’s 14.  Klay Thompson was talking so much shit in that now-infamous press conference before game 5 that the NBA has now converted that room into an above ground septic tank (LeBron subsequently cooked him an exquisite 7 course meal with a hearty serving of crow in every dish. Boris Diaw paired it well with a ‘84 Chateau Margaux).  Draymond continues to kick wildly in the direction of anything with a pair of testicles and was already hated by everybody in America while this team was still likeable.  Add Kevin Durant, who made a Decision 10x more cowardly than LeBron’s while receiving 1/100th of the criticism, and you have a recipe for a terrifyingly good and historically unlikeable team.  That what happens when a 73-win team adds a Top 5 player.  They become a villainous, monolithic entity that has the power to destroy everything good and just in this world. They’re basically the Death Star.  So, while my eyes will be watching the goddamned Warriors ascend to the platonic ideal of shooting efficiency, my heart will be in Oklahoma City, soaking in the rays of blinding light emanating from the exploding star that is Russell Westbrook.  

If you think you’ve seen Russell Westbrook angry, I want you to picture Kevin Durant’s homecoming, his first game back in OKC.  Russell Westbrook will be a man possessed by the righteous fury of God.  A wrecking ball on fire. He will bark motivation at his teammates and teleport across the court like a 4th dimensional being unbound by the laws of space-time; the particle accelerator and the particle.  A light blue streak screaming up and down the court for 46 minutes, tomahawk dunking in semi-transition.  If it’s a close game, he might not sit.  For Christ sakes, he might insist on guarding Durant.  I’d be getting all hot and bothered right now if I hadn’t just pleasured myself to Joel Embiid’s 20-point debut.  Russell Westbrook’s righteous revenge tour began last night, and when he averages 33-11-9 over an entire season, you will all know his wrath.  

But, BUT… it won’t be enough.  Russell Westbrook could have an MVP year and still be unable to drag the Thunder to the 5th seed in the west.  The league, like life, isn’t fair.  The evil basketball powers that have conspired in the West against Saint Russell the Righteous are malicious in their intent and vast in their power.  And Russ’ will can only carry the Thunder so far.  

In the end, Russell Westbrook won’t beat the Warriors.  But it’ll be insanely fun to watch him try.","The Book of Russellations [OC] [Brief note: I'm a Sixers fan, and wrote most of this right after Westbrook signed back with you guys.

This year doesn't look much better as injuries have plagued them in the preseason and they were unable to aquire any valuable trades in the offseason. Watch out for Joel Embid (7'2"" 276lbs) who played and average 15 mins in the preseason, per: 36mins 27.9 pts 14.7 reb and was able to hit some 3s as well. He's a very coordinated center and will prove a difficult match up for Adams who will have to keep him off balance, he's also very weak at assists.

"He just didn't know where (like it really matters though). Who knows what was said in that last meeting, but I think back on that hug that Presti gave to KD when they meet outside the arena for the last time. It seemed unusual, because it looked like he was overly-embracing him, like they were ""best buds,"" but in hindsight, it looks like they both sort of knew what was happening, that this was essentially an exit meeting without actually being called that. And judging by KD's odd performance in the WCFs, Presti probably sensed KD had checked out, knowing he couldn't just walk away if they were back in the Finals.

So that's one piece of my little theory I'm forming. Now looking back at all the moves Presti made prior to KD's departure, especially the Magic trade, it looked Presti was looking much father into the future of the organization.

Getting rid of Ibaka wasn't the goal here. It was putting pieces around Russ that would make the team work better without KD any more. 

Oladipo is the perfect compliment to Russ. Iyalsova and Sabonis were thrown in to help fill the void left by KD until Presti has more time to develop the team. 

And I always thought bringing in Horford would be a giant mistake, considering they would be breaking up the Stache brothers, and having to dig deep in the checkbook to pay someone who on the back 9 of his career.

Notice how Russ has been rather quiet about the whole thing. I'm sure him and Presti were immediately in talks about his contract the days following KD's departure. It looks like Russ was almost crossing his fingers, hoping KD would leave so he could go ahead and become the face of the organization. He seemed poised, and almost kind of relieved.

Then go back and look at the Scott Brooks firing/Billy Donovan hiring. It's almost as if he knew one of the two superstars would eventually want out of OKC, and he would need someone who is better at X's and O's, not so much able to manage personalities. 

And if for some reason KD decided last minute he wants to stay in OKC, well you're not looking at a bad situation there either, although you might want to start looking for someone to replace Russ, and maybe that's where Sam was thinking he could actually incorporate Oladipo in as his replacement.

All in all, once again, we can all look back and appreciate how Presti is one of the best GMs in the league and is always preparing for all sorts of scenarios and working to get the best opportunity.

And even if KD stayed, it was highly likely he would sign a two year deal with an option to leave that next season.

Yes, I attended the game. Yes, the arena wasn't full. Yes, there was a fan with floor seats in front of me wearing an Emmitt Smith jersey and 80s rock n' roll hair. Most people are busy watching football or enjoying the final weeks of decent weather outside. I was busy catching our team at The Peake.

It needs to be said that Minnesota didn't play their best players. KAT and Lavine didn't get a minute. New coach Tom Thibodeau is still getting his feet wet. This team is a border-line playoff team, according to projections. So take it for what it is.

With the Thunder, I noticed according to the game card they had 22 players suited up. Pretty sure they need to cut at least four players, if not more, when the season starts. Hence throwing a lot of ""maybes"" on the floor to see what works.

With that said...

**1) Chemistry** - This team played just like that: a team. Everyone moved the ball. No ""hero ball."" This might just be the ideal team that Coach Billy Donovan wants in his second year to prove he isn't just relying on a couple of superstars to make the Western Conference Finals.

**2) Energy** - Russell and Oladipo set the tone. They drove to the rim as much as possible, pushing in transition on turnovers and fast breaks, not giving up easy baskets. Everyone else could feed off it. 

**3) Diversity** - The key to the Spurs success has been its unconventional and international flair. The Thunder this year appear to be the manifestation of Presti and his own version of a Spurs'-style team in OKC.

"I wanted to get your guys' thoughts on this lineup.
I've been rocking people with this lineup:
Russell Westbrook
Anthony Morrow
Victor Oladipo
Andre Roberson
Steven Adams

The reason I put Roberson at the 4 is because he can be the guy like Draymond to just run out on fast breaks. He also has the size to defend most 4s in the league and he can lock down the passing lanes, sort of how Kevin Durant did it. We need someone like KD with length to get steals, and Roberson does a fabulous job.

Now I know starting Morrow will get sh*t on. I needed the floor spacing. I mean if Singler could shoot he could fit... But for most teams besides golden state you can hide players like Morrow on defense. 

If Abrines can shoot, and if NBA 2K updates, then I would do RW / Dipo / Abrines / Roberson / Adams.

Long story short, I hope we see alot of Roberson at the 4. He can be very disruptive like KD was on both offense and defense. Roberson's game is alot like a 4, setting high ball screens and rolling to the basket.","How I win w/ Thunder in 2K - RW - Morrow - Dipo - Roberson - Adams. Great pace, great spacing, decent defense.

"Back when KD left and Russ re-upped with the Thunder, my friend who cheers for the Mavs said he always thought Russ was better off playing with a team built around him.

Now maybe, just maybe, this makes Sam Presti somewhat of a maniacal genius. Here's why

1) He somehow managed to draft and trade for players that work perfect for a team built around Russ....

2)...knowing that KD would walk, and did everything but show him the door when he left for Golden State.

Hindsight is 20:20, and we know Presti didn't want KD to walk. However, consider this.

The key move here is the Ibaka-Oladipo trade. Why in God's green Earth would the Thunder trade away a power forward who can play both sides of the floor for a guard who is almost a clone of Russ? And why make this move **before** KD's contract expires?

My argument is that Westbrook needs someone to fill the gaps that he can't. The chemistry for Russ wasn't there with KD and Ibaka (both forwards), but it was there with the centers, Adams and Kanter. So what could it be with another guard who has a similar skill-set to Russ?

Regardless what Presti knew or didn't know, he now has built a team around what could be the next MVP of the league, and this is a guard/center-heavy lineup. 

In the past, everything worked through the shooting forward position that KD played. Presti spent years studying the strengths and weaknesses of this position, and essentially drafted around this position to shore up what he could. Instead, he built something entirely different, built around a guard that wasn't supposed to be drafted #3 in 2008.

"I don't see us going after Rudy Gay or any other small forward, I think our answer is already on our team. Kyle Singler. Before you get upset or start laughing, I'm being serious. He was a solid sf in Detroit. He averaged 10/4/2/1 while shooting ~40% from 3. He has good size and a good bb iq, he's just in a (very) long slump. But I think that might change this season once he sees he's our only true small forward who can play at least average on both sides of the floor.

"The 2017 Oklahoma City Thunder don’t care about the future of the game. They don’t care about pace and space, nor do they care for silly things like efficiency or advanced statistics. They certainly don’t give a shit about the template that the Golden State Warriors have created.

No, the Thunder aren’t looking forward in the construction of their team. They’re just hoping that lightning will strike that clocktower in Hill Valley yet again. 

Comparing Russell Westbrook and Hall of Fame guard Allen Iverson isn’t exactly some revolutionary idea. People have seen the similarities for years, from the high volume numbers (and yes, low efficiency) to their bipolar attitudes on and off the court. Hell, Iverson even [supports](http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/25114137/allen-iverson-says-hes-the-biggest-russell-westbrook-fan-there-is) the juxtaposition himself, calling Westbrook his favorite player in the game today. But, up to this point, the Thunder front office has ignored those parallels.

I mean, they had a pretty good reason for it. Where Westbrook might be closest thing we’ll see to Iverson in a very long time, Durant couldn’t be any more different. A team built around Westbrook wouldn’t fit Durant, and vice versa. Hence the [hodgepodge](http://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/456/504/hi-res-4a640ff411b2ce30c39a1093f294ff43_crop_north.jpg?w=630&h=420&q=75) rosters that we’ve seen the past few years.

But that’s changing. Durant is gone, as is Ibaka. This is very clearly Brodie’s team now, and the Thunder are looking back to find the mold for this new-look squad. Pretty far back actually, to a team just as unconventional to the game back then as it would be now. The 2001 Philadelphia 76ers.

At the turn of the century, [big men](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/81/d1/84/81d184557d00e8f5d97910ef67840a6f.jpg) ruled the game. Centers dominated, huge wings did their best Jordan impressions from the high post, and point guards were forced to reside in the corners where they wouldn’t accidentally bring a double to the post man. Meanwhile, the Sixers’ lone offensive option was a 6’ combo guard. They had zero talent on the wing, an aging defensive specialist at the 5, and a stacked armory of versatile defenders. 

Russell Westbrook is not a conventional player, so the Thunder aren’t following any conventional methods in building a contender around him. 

With Victor Oladipo, they found a near carbon copy of Aaron McKie. Steven Adams is a decent defensive big man, vaguely in the vein of Deke, and Enes Kanter is a much better Matt Geiger. Andre Roberson could easily be mistaken for just about any of Philly’s barrage of faceless wings. With Cameron Payne, they have the modern adaptation of a role player point guard. Instead of defense and steals, like Eric Snow, he's more of a penetrate and iso guy. It's a necessary modification to the aging template.  They have a couple more shooters, too, but the final product will nonetheless be very familiar. 

It’ll be ugly. It’ll grind where other teams glide. Like Jeremy Clarkson, it will respond to every problem with a [hammer](http://imgur.com/6bK6x0u), whether it be a loose nail or a leaky condom. They’ll score just enough, and they’ll make the other team work their asses off on both ends of the floor.

It all starts with Westbrook himself. I’m not going to go into a massive scouting report here. We all know how Westbrook plays. We know what he can and cannot do, and we love or hate him for it. He’s a ballistic animal on both ends of the floor, an undeniable net positive who makes everyone on both sides want to bash their head into a wall.

That mindset plays into the team prototype perfectly. Russell Westbrook is [exhausting](https://thunderstuff.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_7803.jpg). He’s exhausting to guard, and he’s exhausting to be guarded by. If you know one thing about him, you know that he won’t get tired. 

When the opposing bigs get tired from helping, they’ll dump the ball down to Enes Kanter to grind out some buckets in the post. Oladipo’s offensive skills leave much to be desired, but his abilities as a secondary ball handler should be just enough to give Westbrook a break on the rare occasion when he needs to catch his breath. Absurdly physical lineups will infuriate opposing players on both ends. 

It’ll be like a more optimized version of the team that gave the Warriors a run for their money in the WCF this year. A simpler (and admittedly less potent) offense, more emphasis on the bigs, and unpredictable chaos on both ends. 

Some will hate it. Coaches will complain, refs will lose their tempers, and fans from both sides will vent their frustrations in game threads year round. Like the AC/DC song, the Thunder(struck) will be loud, proud, and a bit screechy, but no less great. Mark my words, this will work.

The team might not win 60 games, and they might not even be considered a contender. But they will win games, and they will make the playoffs. There’s a reason why the Grizzlies seem to make the playoffs every single year. Grinding works. It doesn’t sell tickets, and it doesn’t garner national attention, but it does rack up those Ws. And for a team with an Uchiha-esque obsession with vengeance, that’ll be more than enough.


","Thunderstruck [OC] [x-post from r/nba] The 2017 Oklahoma City Thunder don’t care about the future of the game. They don’t care about pace and space, nor do they care for silly things like efficiency or advanced statistics. They certainly don’t give a shit about the template that the Golden State Warriors have created.

No, the Thunder aren’t looking forward in the construction of their team. They’re just hoping that lightning will strike that clocktower in Hill Valley yet again. 

Comparing Russell Westbrook and Hall of Fame guard Allen Iverson isn’t exactly some revolutionary idea. People have seen the similarities for years, from the high volume numbers (and yes, low efficiency) to their bipolar attitudes on and off the court. Hell, Iverson even [supports](http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/25114137/allen-iverson-says-hes-the-biggest-russell-westbrook-fan-there-is) the juxtaposition himself, calling Westbrook his favorite player in the game today. But, up to this point, the Thunder front office has ignored those parallels.

I mean, they had a pretty good reason for it. Where Westbrook might be closest thing we’ll see to Iverson in a very long time, Durant couldn’t be any more different. A team built around Westbrook wouldn’t fit Durant, and vice versa. Hence the [hodgepodge](http://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/456/504/hi-res-4a640ff411b2ce30c39a1093f294ff43_crop_north.jpg?w=630&h=420&q=75) rosters that we’ve seen the past few years.

But that’s changing. Durant is gone, as is Ibaka. This is very clearly Brodie’s team now, and the Thunder are looking back to find the mold for this new-look squad. Pretty far back actually, to a team just as unconventional to the game back then as it would be now. The 2001 Philadelphia 76ers.

At the turn of the century, [big men](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/81/d1/84/81d184557d00e8f5d97910ef67840a6f.jpg) ruled the game. Centers dominated, huge wings did their best Jordan impressions from the high post, and point guards were forced to reside in the corners where they wouldn’t accidentally bring a double to the post man. Meanwhile, the Sixers’ lone offensive option was a 6’ combo guard. They had zero talent on the wing, an aging defensive specialist at the 5, and a stacked armory of versatile defenders. 

Russell Westbrook is not a conventional player, so the Thunder aren’t following any conventional methods in building a contender around him. 

With Victor Oladipo, they found a near carbon copy of Aaron McKie. Steven Adams is a decent defensive big man, vaguely in the vein of Deke, and Enes Kanter is a much better Matt Geiger. Andre Roberson could easily be mistaken for just about any of Philly’s barrage of faceless wings. With Cameron Payne, they have the modern adaptation of a role player point guard. Instead of defense and steals, like Eric Snow, he's more of a penetrate and iso guy. It's a necessary modification to the aging template.  They have a couple more shooters, too, but the final product will nonetheless be very familiar. 

It’ll be ugly. It’ll grind where other teams glide. Like Jeremy Clarkson, it will respond to every problem with a [hammer](http://imgur.com/6bK6x0u), whether it be a loose nail or a leaky condom. They’ll score just enough, and they’ll make the other team work their asses off on both ends of the floor.

It all starts with Westbrook himself. I’m not going to go into a massive scouting report here. We all know how Westbrook plays. We know what he can and cannot do, and we love or hate him for it. He’s a ballistic animal on both ends of the floor, an undeniable net positive who makes everyone on both sides want to bash their head into a wall.

4- Some important players such as WB and Adams seem to have off the court friendships with him, so trading him can lower team morale.

5- He ,atleast, worked hard on defense and actually improved. 

6- He is a very good rebounder in both ends.

7- With Durants' departure we need a high volume, high efficiency scorer.

8- We do not have depth in center position (Only Adams and Kanter are natural centers, rest are PFs).  

9- Twin towers lineup looked promising in the playoffs (and it was the first time we used it extensively, with proper training it can become even better!).

10- He is is still young and did not reach his prime.
 
These are just some of the point that came to my mind. If you have more, please contribute!

Long story short, Why should we trade a player that seems to be an important part of this team, for a potentially good player that may or may not fit well with the team?

Note: I do not think we can get Butler or Griffin just by trading Kanter. We would also need to give away atleast one promising young players, such as Adams or Oledipo. ","Why some people are so eager to trade Kanter?? Why the hell should we trade Kanter for a SF or PF. I have a hard time understanding this. I am not sure if mine is an unpopular opinion but here it is; 

1- Kanter proven himself to be an important offensive contributor.
 
2- He actually likes being in OKC

3- He has good chemistry with his teammates.

4- Some important players such as WB and Adams seem to have off the court friendships with him, so trading him can lower team morale.

"So we just acquired Lauvergne for a very good deal, at least so it seems to me. I haven't watched him play a whole lot but he seems like the best natural starting power forward of those that we have. 

But knowing Presti this trade wouldn't have occured with just the reason of dumping McGary, i think. Are there any possible deals we could package for the obvious gap we have at the SF spot? 

I have seen rumours of deals for Butler and Griffin but those not only seem unreasonable but also not helping our needs (most would include packaging either oladipo, kanter/adams, and more.)

The general concensus seems a trade for Rudy Gay, although many have criticized his consistency and whatnot. What we really need is a 3&D player i think, now which SF's could we try and trade for? Jae Crowder perhaps? Some mentioned Demarre Carroll, but his contract might cause problems. The obvious fit for our playing style would be Giannis but ofcourse milwaukee doesn't what the lose him. I don't know about Joe Johnson's situation but he would be a personal favourite.

"Above all, he plays with some of the most fire I have ever seen. The man never takes a second to cool down. I may be speaking out of emotion or just pure passion, but what Russell Westbrook did today was truly amazing in this day and age. He could have let the first half of the season play out, see if we were any good and then make a choice if he wants out. But he clearly never wanted out. He wanted to make a statement: both to his OKC teammates/fans, and to the rest of the league. This is definitive proof that there IS STILL COMPETITIVE FIRE IN THIS LEAGUE.

Not many superstars in any league have shown the kind of loyalty and fight that Russell just showed the world today. He could have eventually asked for a trade to the Spurs or Cavs, and I think a lot of us would understand him doing so after what Durant did to him and the franchise. 

But, like Durant, he showed his true colors. And you know what? I think players around the league will take notice. This BS that no superstar wants to play with RW is ridiculous - if I was an NBA player I would jump at the chance to play with someone who cares as much as  Westbrook and I think that will attract free agents coming up next summer and the year after.

" If I'm not mistaken, and please correct me if I'm wrong, with some shuffling around we could offer a Max deal to a F/A next season before resigning Adams & Oladipo. So money wise this is possible. 


 Now before I go any further I'm not sure this will happen and that it's kind of a long shot.  I repeat: I'm not saying it's going to happen or that it's a guaranteed thing. I know that one Jazz fan lurking here for the Kanter shit will see this and think lol some dumb okc fan thinking he gon get Hayward. HOWEVER! I do think it's much more realistic and likely we can get Hayward than Blake Griffin. 



 Anyway so why do I think this a slight possibility? Well there a couple of reasons. The first being that Presti and the Front Office is known to be big fans of Hayward. We have an opening and could potentially offer a more competitive team to Hayward than the Jazz can. The Jazz are going to start having to max players out these next couple of years and are going to need to clear some space. Hayward could be the number two guy on a young and improving team with a legit chance to win a title as the young guys go into their prime as Golden State loses players due to finances and LeBron starts to decline. Plus he gets to play with a legit Super Star. While I think Gobert & Hood both have Star potential neither of them have reached it yet, and neither of them have superstar potential IMO.

 
 Now for the reasons why this is highly unlikely. The Jazz are very high on Hayward and would probably choose him over Favors if finances are going to be a problem. The Jazz can offer him more money. And lastly for all intents and purposes, Hayward seems to genuinely be happy where he's at with his life in Utah. They also have a great coach and culture and it's going to be tough to talk him to leave Utah to come to Oklahoma. 

 But anyway I mainly made this because I'd like to get ya'lls opinion on this too. My brain has been wracking possible ways to upgrade the team and this seems to be one of the more realistic options without us gutting the team or getting rid one of our core guys. I don't think it happens but I think out of all the huge F/A's we will target next season, he's the most realistic. 

 Also a little sad we didn't sign Ty Lawson after finding out about Payne. I know he's a knucklehead and I know you guys made it clear you hate him, but for a the minimum he might be worth a gamble. I like him more than I like price tbh. 

 Anyway #Thunderup and #PraiseBrodie","I think we have a small shot at poaching Gordon Hayward as a F/A next season.

"I hate your team and especially your ownership group. However, Westbrook resigning despite making me sad and initially dumbfounded, it is a really good thing for the people who actually matter, the fans. 


When OKC took the Hornets in, it proved you deserved a franchise, you can tell the atmosphere is incredible. If their had been differing circumstances, a team gained through expansion not relocation, their obviously would be no hostility. I know other Sonics fans aren't at this point, but I am finally getting to that point, where I can let it go. It is safe to say KD leaving has tipped it over the edge, when Collison leaves/retires then I hope and expect my anger to subside. The Thunder will be the team I hate the most, never want to win etc, but I can't hold anything against the vast majority of fans of this franchise, just give us our franchise history back when we get an expansion team.

"I admit that myself and many friends I know always preferred Durant over Westbrook until 2015 when he went on that amazing run and there was no denying how good the man really is. I admit that we all preferred Durant's attitude over Westbrook's until last year when I realized that's who Russ is, a fiery resilient competitor who takes nothing from no one. I admit that I always though KD would be more loyal than Russ in staying with OKC, boy was I wrong. Russell Westbrook is the man that keeps it real, is loyal and committed to helping the Thunder, he made his decision earlier because he didn't want to devastate the team and leave them with nothing if he had left in free agency. That in itself is extremely amazing and professional, I hope for him and the loyalty he has that he can take the Thunder to that elusive Finals and hopefully a ring.

"All I can say is I'm happy for ya'll. I've always liked OKC, for Harden, and wanted to see guys succeed. I was just as pissed as most of you when I heard KD left, and know how terrifying the idea of losing Beastbrook was and how gratifying this feels. I felt the same way when I heard that Harden had signed an extension with the Rockets. Even with the monetary gains he'd make, it really showed that he loved the city, team, and fans as much we loved him. It that he was dedicated to winning here, and winning for us. Both WB and JH get shit from the media for their personalities and playing styles, but the impact they have on their teams is unmeasurable. After all these years of a Harden led team, all I can say is, buckle up. You're in for some of the most exciting basketball you could want. I've learned that one man, with dedication, can take his team above and beyond what anyone thinks he can. And players like WB and Harden, with that skill and focus, that tenacity, are well equipped for the job. Enjoy these years of WB led ball, enjoy the development of Oladipo and Kanter, enjoy rallying your city around this one man. And enjoy the many many surprises to come.

"There are several articles in recent days discussing J.R. Smith, a free agent, and where he should go if he doesn't stick with Cleveland. ([example 1](http://espn.go.com/blog/boston/celtics/post/_/id/4723639/should-the-celtics-consider-free-agent-j-r-smith)), ([example 2](http://www.cleveland.com/sports/index.ssf/2016/07/jr_smith_of_the_cleveland_cava.html))

I don't consider it an unrealistic stretch that Smith could sign with OKC. He's waited this long, and a lot of dominoes have fallen while other teams have filled up their salary cap space on guys you would never have imagined getting paid that much (i.e. Mike Conley).

Now Smith has his ring, and it's time to get paid. OKC has a void in scoring since KD left. The 2nd article I linked said Smith is looking at $15m/year, which at this point you could consider giving him a 2-year deal with a player option. He would probably get a starting position at the 3 spot, although he might be a valuable asset coming off the bench with Kanter and Payne. I think he's matured now as a player where he won't be a headcase or lockerroom distraction like we have seen in the past. He started his career in OKC with the Hornets, so if the Thunder are considering him, I think he will listen.

"Four years ago I became a OKC fan. I wasn't familiar with basketball at all and I'm from a really small country in Europe called Macedonia so I wasn't that big on the NBA. 
I chose Oklahoma City Thunder because I instantly got attracted; I saw their players, I saw the logo and everything and I instantly fell in love. I'm not gonna lie, KD was a big influence. I remember I watched like shit ton of videos on youtube for like two days straight, I kept staying all night to watch my OKC play and it was amazing. I loved watching Russ & KD play together, I really did man and it pains me to see that we're probably never gonna see them together. But you know that's in the past and I'm honestly grateful that I saw this duo play together. I love KD, he's the main reason why I started watching basketball and I appreciate what he did for this team, but of course I'm still a little bit sad because of his decision. 
Anyways, enough of that. I think that Russ doesn't get a lot of credit, like it always used to be KD and Russ was always in his shadow. I know how fucking crazy Russ can get when KD is not around so I can't believe I'm saying this but I think this is the most excited I've been since I became a fan. Like seriously, the thought of Russ dominating this league gets me fucking hyped you know? I just want him to destroy every fucking team, get revenge. 
I know that deep down we will probably struggle but I will believe in Russ. I think he's gonna lead this team really far and I do hope he stays in OKC for a longer time. 
Sorry for rambling, just wanted to say what I think. Also apologies if I made any mistakes, English ain't my first language. ","I AM SO FUCKING EXCITED Four years ago I became a OKC fan.

"Good morning fellow Thunder fans, I've seen some hot takes around these parts and /r/nba on the Sports Animal and since it's the off season and our roster is about shaped up (miss you Didi) I thought I'd open up this fair and rational discussion I'd wanted to have hear for awhile. 

**It's** been fun seeing comments on Reddit about folks being so triggered by The Animal and I find it funny and I don't know why. I remember one Thunder fan, I will not name names but I hope he shows up tell me that ""The Sports Animal appeals to the lowest common denominator"" and that's why he listens to The Franchise. You know, the ""rival"" radio station that has a non-stop stream of drunk and digestive issue jokes as female member Kara (Cara?) Rice degrades herself mercilessly. These days they have a morning Pokemon Go update every morning. Top kek.

**Let's** start with the Morning Animals. When the old Animals left to go to the Franchise I was breathless and heartbroken. I didn't get to listen to them a whole lot except during summer internships or maybe an early class for a semester but I was very sad when they left. My fears quickly diminished though as I begrudgingly found myself in a giggle as toked out super homer Spinozi furiously circlejerked the rest of the old fatties into quality morning sports talk. They're not perfect but they mix up the sports with the trash making for an entertaining commute to work.

**Next up** there's Chris Humphries. Not much to say here, he's an empty void of emotion and more or less just drones on about how Tiger Woods will still win a major tournament. You'd be better off with a glass of warm milk and melatonin whilst listening to The Franchise during the Hump Man's hour.

**Then** there are the frat star beer bros that run the Monsters of the Mid Day. What makes half the show is the retards like ""Everett"" who call in giving opinions that give the best shitposts of /r/nba a run for their money. Also Mark Rodgers is easily the most self aware guy on the station, especially compared his aloof partner Dusty Divorceforcheck. Dusty is 100x better than the other wackass OU player they had with Mark before but Sam Mayes still had better chemistry when he was on IMO. I'm pretty sure one of their producers is a Redditor. He fits all the archetypes being a contrarian, sporting a beard, lobbying for Bernie, and just making millennials look like absolute jackasses. Josh if you're reading this please do an AMA bby ty. Not to mention when Mark is on with Jim Traber it's some of the most entertaining local radio there is. It's always nice listening to Mark work up Fat Man Jim into a yelling tizzy. 

**Which** brings me to the the most polarizing figure in all of Oklahoma City radio, Jim Traber. The man, the myth, the ego, the ULTIMATE. Jim's job is pretty much to stir up some kind of magical love and hate storm towards him. He spends his time on the airwaves triggering super fans and left wingers with facts, logic, and a bit of 80s cocaine autism catching up to him. I like Jim, he's right more than he is wrong but he can be sooo wrong. Him pretending to not understand the hate for KD when he left was just about inexcusable. He does to a good job of criticizing OU and OSU, and his criticisms on the Thunder are pretty spot on and a welcome voice to break up the ""lovefest"" as he calls it. Here's one for the yardbirds Jim, thank you for carrying the station on your back!

**Finally** there is Al Eschbach. The creepy old man with a bit of a creepy accent that pioneered Oklahoma sports radio. He spends is evenings painting his taint crimson and cream in front of a Bob Stoops bobblehead. Al is best in other company and in moderation with Jim, Berry Trammel and Dean Blevins in the total dominance hour. Al's been in the industry for awhile so I get why he's there but there's no excuse for him to have 2 hours for phone calls at the end of the day. I guess old folks listen to him before bed at 8.

**So** that's it, not to bash the Franchise too much. Competition is essential and I'm glad we're in a market that allows for such. I think KD leaving might be a bit worrying for the Franchise, hopefully we can stay contenders and keep up the radio competition. 

I realize that some, if not many of you probably don't listen to local radio because you live out of state or country but I cannot for the life of me listen to ESPN radio or any of the big guys, even if the local guy's are annoying they're more in the know especially if you're into CFB. Also feel free to recommend some podcasts. Local radio is sure to be stroking the crimson n cream here for the next 3 months so work might just suck a little bit more. ","Thoughts on WWLS The Sports Animal and other local OKC sports radio? Good morning fellow Thunder fans, I've seen some hot takes around these parts and /r/nba on the Sports Animal and since it's the off season and our roster is about shaped up (miss you Didi) I thought I'd open up this fair and rational discussion I'd wanted to have hear for awhile. 

**It's** been fun seeing comments on Reddit about folks being so triggered by The Animal and I find it funny and I don't know why. I remember one Thunder fan, I will not name names but I hope he shows up tell me that ""The Sports Animal appeals to the lowest common denominator"" and that's why he listens to The Franchise. You know, the ""rival"" radio station that has a non-stop stream of drunk and digestive issue jokes as female member Kara (Cara?) Rice degrades herself mercilessly. These days they have a morning Pokemon Go update every morning. Top kek.

**Let's** start with the Morning Animals. When the old Animals left to go to the Franchise I was breathless and heartbroken. I didn't get to listen to them a whole lot except during summer internships or maybe an early class for a semester but I was very sad when they left. My fears quickly diminished though as I begrudgingly found myself in a giggle as toked out super homer Spinozi furiously circlejerked the rest of the old fatties into quality morning sports talk. They're not perfect but they mix up the sports with the trash making for an entertaining commute to work.

**Next up** there's Chris Humphries. Not much to say here, he's an empty void of emotion and more or less just drones on about how Tiger Woods will still win a major tournament. You'd be better off with a glass of warm milk and melatonin whilst listening to The Franchise during the Hump Man's hour.

**Then** there are the frat star beer bros that run the Monsters of the Mid Day. What makes half the show is the retards like ""Everett"" who call in giving opinions that give the best shitposts of /r/nba a run for their money. Also Mark Rodgers is easily the most self aware guy on the station, especially compared his aloof partner Dusty Divorceforcheck. Dusty is 100x better than the other wackass OU player they had with Mark before but Sam Mayes still had better chemistry when he was on IMO. I'm pretty sure one of their producers is a Redditor.

"Anderson Varejao is eligible to receive his first NBA championship ring, but instead plans to remain loyal to the Golden State Warriors and will not accept the hardware, according to Ohio-based reporter Sam Amico.

The 6-11 big man spent 11 full seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers before being dealt to the Portland Trail Blazers on Feb. 18 in a three-team deal that involved the Orlando Magic, who sent Channing Frye to the Cavs.

The Blazers unloaded a second-round pick to get a first-round pick and Varejao, who was immediately released. The Warriors picked him up four days later.

Varejao became the first player to ever play for both Finals teams in the same season, all but guaranteeing him a ring.

There's no NBA policy mandating a ring for players not on the roster by midseason; that decision would be up to the Cavaliers' front office. But, if offered, Varejao told the Cavs he would no accept the ring out of respect for his Warriors teammates, Amico's report said.

"Reposting this after my 7 day ""hold"" period for my throwaway account:

Alternate account - have to be anonymous. I have access to some of KD's inner circle/biz side and it surprises me how many stories have not been reported about KD himself and how his inner circle is able to control him - including ROC Nation and Nike. I've been involved pre/post ROC and what KD did was the natural outcome of what ROC set out to accomplish in conjunction with Nike from day 1.

Nike's goal was to stop the spread of UA and to further KD's push into Asia - that's been reported. There is also a serious effort to use KD as the means of swaying currently signed UA folks into the Nike fold. It was Nike's #1 goal for 2016 to get KD onto GSW - I know certain media members have copies of the internal PPT that went around with this explicitly outlined. Not sure why it hasn't been reported out yet - perhaps it will form the core of a new book? Same slides also show that the value of the KD brand was being degraded terribly and Nike put a lot of the blame onto ROC management and decision making. 

On the KD front - two stories.

He dicked over his mom. Wanda worked in contracting for the federal government. When KD was signed, he talked his mom into quitting her fed job (was unseemly for her to be working a govt job - hated the idea of her working even though she was widely respected and wanted to keep working) and, in exchange, she was given a house and a monthly allowance etc. It was fairly generous and it allowed Wanda to make it to most of KD's games and generally be KD's primary source of support/advice. She's the real MVP, remember? Well - when ROC came on board, Wanda had to go. They basically isolated KD from Wanda and surrounded him in a way that kept her out of the decision making process. Not terrible/evil - makes sense for ROC to want to protect their marquee client from anyone else having his ear. The dick move? KD allowed ROC to gut Wanda's monthly support to barely anything - that's why you've seen Wanda doing more public speaking, asking for speaking fees, not attending as many games, and generally hustling for money. KD pushed his mom out of her gov't job and promised to support her. His new management came on board and KD allowed them to isolate him from his mom's counsel and also cut her allowance. Great character there KD.

I also don't think anyone ever looked into the first doctor who performed surgery on his foot as he is a hack. ROC pushed KD into using this particular surgeon - not the Thunder -  even though the Thunder/NBA was paying all the bills. Seems a bit fishy - why would you use a doctor recommended by a sports management company? What do they know? Why would they want to recommend this particular guy? Well, like most things -- follow the money and in this case, it was because ROC was getting a kick back from the doctor. Some enterprising reporter should follow those strings... where did the money go? 

The media wanted KD to be the ""good guy"" as a foil for LBJ's ""bad guy"" - remember the 2012 Finals? Well, KD has broken that story line and it's going to be an interesting flood of stories about KD's actual character and personality now. He may think that he will be able to overcome ""the noise"" but he isn't going to get the treatment he got before. And there are a lot of stories out there and a lot of people who want to tell them. It ain't gonna be pretty and a lot of Thunder/KD fans are going to feel duped. ","Kevin Durant's Character is not what everyone thought... Inner circle pulls his strings now.

" I've been racking my brain since Durant left on how we should feel the void he left in our team. We desperately need another wing player, one that can shoot preferably, and it seems like any that are worth anything would be too difficult for us to get. We have a bunch of assets... It's just really hard to replenish them in our market for several different reasons so for us to give them up it would have to be an absolute steal for us imo. Don't get me wrong, I'm talking about Payne, Roberson, Abrines, and Sabonis here. McGary, Huestist, and Christon are all assets, but they're kind of worthless assets at this point. 

 Anyway what do you guys think? Should we pursue Gallo from the Nuggets? Maybe try to snag Matthews or DeMare at an extremely high price? Just wait things out and hope Westbrook accepts maybe taking a step back this year instead of competing? 
 
 I'm not gonna lie. I really want to go into the front office side of sports, but it's time like this that I'm really glad I'm not. I don't even know what the right answer is. And this is just assuming we're keeping Westbrook and he'll resign. Not even contemplating the very real possibility we have to trade him.

"Just found this. Thought I'd share. 

Dear Kevin Durant,

I don't write you this letter from an angry place, I write this letter with the upmost disappointment. The NBA and its fans lost today, they lost big time, because of what you just did. I like you Kevin, in fact, I loved who you were. You let your basketball do all the talking, and for me, you are still in the top 3 players in the world. It comes with great sadness that I write this, because I never thought you would make the decision you just made.

I can't imagine what Russell Westbrook is feeling right now. Again, one of my favorite players in the league and my heart breaks for him. Everything you guys have been through, you've thrown away. Just like that, you've thrown it away. You used to call him your brother, your partner, your killer in crime, and now you've driven off, leaving him in the rear view mirror with no where to go. I remember when you won your MVP in 2013, and you stood on that stage with tears in your eyes, looking right at Russell and said you loved him, that he would run through a wall for you. He watched you hold up that trophy when he could have been easily holding it up at that moment instead. But he was happy for you, that moment really resinated with me. But now, for what. Did you forget those moments? Did you forget when you couldn't possibly give any more he would pick you up? As much as people want to diss Westbrook, he allowed you to be you. At any other franchise, if he really wanted to, that guy could be THE man, and tell the organization that he is going to be the man and make sure it's that way. But he didn't, not for you, Kevin. He wanted you to be great, and he wanted to be great with you. He sacrificed a large chunk of his prime, to share a locker room with you, to walk into the gym and see you there.

A lot of NBA fans may think this is similar to the Miami Heat situation of 2010, but it's really not Kevin. You see, Miami formed a Big 3, but it wasn't even remotely close to the greatest team of all time. The Miami Heat hadn't just won a championship a year ago. The Miami Heat weren't the greatest regular season team of all time. The Miami Heat didn't hold a 2 time MVP. The Miami Heat didn't have possibly the 2 greatest shooters ever. The Miami Heat didn't have the coach of the year. The Miami Heat didn't create a big 5 essentially, like the Warriors have just chosen to do. And no Kevin, It's not the same as what LeBron did. The difference between you and LeBron is this, LeBron had to suffer. LeBron had to suffer for 7 of his 13 NBA seasons as year after year, he would watch the Cavaliers organization surround him with absolute garbage, expecting him to take them places, and crazy enough, he actually did. You didn't have that in Oklahoma. The Thunder were willing to do ANYTHING and everything to keep you and build a championship roster around you, but you still turned your back. You were playing with a top 5 player and arguably the best point guard in the league, and you still turned around and walked the other way.

I can't speak for Oklahoma City Thunder fans, but I imagine they are absolutely heartbroken. They never thought you'd do this, they never thought you'd break them like this. Now, after your decision, the Thunder fans may see Westbrook walk out the door right in front of them as well, did they deserve that? Did you not kiss your jersey in front of them? Look them dead in the eyes and tell them you loved them? 

Kevin, you may think it's ok, but it's not. You've now created a super power in the NBA that has shifted the balance of power to a degree which might not reverse for a long time. I don't have a problem with you leaving, but I do have a problem with who you left to. This is a team that literally stopped you from getting to an NBA Finals a month or so ago. What goes through your mind to join them, instead of finishing what you started and knocking them off? You didn't see Kobe join the Celtics, or Jordan join the ""Bad Boy"" Pistons, or LeBron join the Celtics, Magic or Pistons when they stopped him from getting to a Finals. No, he took a risk, and he joined Miami to take down those very same Celtics that caused him pain year after year. They didn't do it, why are you? If you can't beat them, join them....right? Wrong. Even if you do win multiple championships with this team, I'm not sure how much weight it holds. I'm not sure this move helps your career like you anticipated it would.

I'm not really sure what else I have to say, but I'm writing this with great sadness. I don't hate you Kevin, but the world might. I'm not sure if you wanted to be that guy, but now you are. I'm still in shock, and in truth, I'm not really sure how I feel. 

One thing I do know, however, I can never look at you the same way ever again...

You see, Miami formed a Big 3, but it wasn't even remotely close to the greatest team of all time. The Miami Heat hadn't just won a championship a year ago. The Miami Heat weren't the greatest regular season team of all time. The Miami Heat didn't hold a 2 time MVP. The Miami Heat didn't have possibly the 2 greatest shooters ever. The Miami Heat didn't have the coach of the year. The Miami Heat didn't create a big 5 essentially, like the Warriors have just chosen to do. And no Kevin, It's not the same as what LeBron did. The difference between you and LeBron is this, LeBron had to suffer. LeBron had to suffer for 7 of his 13 NBA seasons as year after year, he would watch the Cavaliers organization surround him with absolute garbage, expecting him to take them places, and crazy enough, he actually did. You didn't have that in Oklahoma. The Thunder were willing to do ANYTHING and everything to keep you and build a championship roster around you, but you still turned your back. You were playing with a top 5 player and arguably the best point guard in the league, and you still turned around and walked the other way.

I can't speak for Oklahoma City Thunder fans, but I imagine they are absolutely heartbroken. They never thought you'd do this, they never thought you'd break them like this. Now, after your decision, the Thunder fans may see Westbrook walk out the door right in front of them as well, did they deserve that? Did you not kiss your jersey in front of them? Look them dead in the eyes and tell them you loved them? 

Kevin, you may think it's ok, but it's not. You've now created a super power in the NBA that has shifted the balance of power to a degree which might not reverse for a long time. I don't have a problem with you leaving, but I do have a problem with who you left to. This is a team that literally stopped you from getting to an NBA Finals a month or so ago. What goes through your mind to join them, instead of finishing what you started and knocking them off? You didn't see Kobe join the Celtics, or Jordan join the ""Bad Boy"" Pistons, or LeBron join the Celtics, Magic or Pistons when they stopped him from getting to a Finals. No, he took a risk, and he joined Miami to take down those very same Celtics that caused him pain year after year. They didn't do it, why are you? If you can't beat them, join them....right? Wrong. Even if you do win multiple championships with this team, I'm not sure how much weight it holds. I'm not sure this move helps your career like you anticipated it would.

I'm not really sure what else I have to say, but I'm writing this with great sadness. I don't hate you Kevin, but the world might. I'm not sure if you wanted to be that guy, but now you are. I'm still in shock, and in truth, I'm not really sure how I feel. 

One thing I do know, however, I can never look at you the same way ever again...

"This is probably going to come as a fan fiction, but I don't care. My mind is pleasant thanking of the possibility of OKC winning it all this year.

Can you imagine, slipping into the 7th seed and playing the Spurs? We are counted out the entire series, but with grit and determination, manage to win in 7. We next play, let's say, the Grizzlies in the second round. Once again, our toughness and absolute desire to win gets us over the hump.

Then the Western Conference Finals. Golden State Warriors. Fresh off a record breaking 79-3 season, and having swept the Thunder in the season series, seems primed to return to the Finals. KD and Steph dominate the first three games, blowing us out in each one. The media rains down on us, telling us that the Warriors are the team of destiny, and no matter how big of a rivalry this is, the Thunder just do not have enough. 

Game 4. We take it. Adams and Kanter play gritty, amassing 40 rebounds between the two. Hard-nosed defense in the backcourt from Westbrook, Roberson, and Oladipo keep us going. Unsung heroes like McGary and Waiters step up and hit big shots. The crowd chants OKC...OKC...OKC as the boys leave the floor, ecstatic that we were able to take at least one game. 

But then Game 5 rolls around. Westbrook goes Beast mode and the Warriors have no answer. Suddenly, we are down 3-2. The media still bashes the Thunder, saying there is no way they can do this again. They are playing above their skill set and are tired.

Then Game 6. The Peake is the loudest it has ever been. You can't even hear yourself think. Each shot by Durant is booed loudly and proudly. Big shot after big shot, big stop after big stop. Seconds left, game tied. Westbrook drives to the hole, passing Curry and around Green and lays in a difficult layup.

Game over. It's tied 3-3. The crowd's eardrums burst from the decibel level. Many drunks walk the streets of Bricktown crying, THUNDER UP WOOOO!!!

Game 7. For a trip against Lebron. Seconds remain. Warriors up 1. Shot clock is running out. The ball goes to Durant, who puts up a jumper. But Adams is there, with an incredible block! He is able to grab it and call timeout. The crowd at Oracle is quiet as a mouse. Five seconds left. OKC inbounds it to Roberson, who gives it to Westbrook. The tough Warrior D won't let him penetrate. But that's okay. From five feet beyond the arc, Westbrook launches a prayer.

Swish.

You could hear a pin drop. The Thunder players storm the court, jumping up and down in glee. The media calls it one of the biggest upsets in the NBA and the ultimate redemption.

And then we sweep the Cavs and win the title yayyyy

"Like seriously!  No one gave the Thunder shit when they traded away Ibaka who had been extremely loyal over the years.  James Harden was loyal and then was traded.

I really don't blame Durant for leaving.  He gave the franchise 8 good years and without a few injuries I'm sure the Thunder would have gone to more finals.

"Just wanted to tell you guys i'm sorry for KD leaving. I am one who is just so furious that this has happened. This is such a loss for the fans of the NBA. It's really impossible to not imagine Cleveland vs Golden State Part 3. When i read the article and saw he chose Golden State i thought it was fake. Kevin Durant looks like such a loyal guy i would never think he would take the easy way out this way. I mean seriously. His PPG will most definitely take a big hit now. This ruins his legacy. He could have done it in OKC. They literally almost beat GSW. They had 3 chances to close it out and KD chocked. But it doesn't seem like he wants to own up to it and took the easy way out.

"For the distraught: skip to paragraph 2

Enough with the Durant hate. Does it suck he’s gone? Obviously yes! Are we allowed to feel betrayed, hurt, frustrated, sad? Obviously yes! Hopeless…. NO! I won’t spend more than few sentences on this because this is not the point of this post. We all love(d) KD, he has been a legend to the city and the franchise. His decision to leave was his right as a player and a person; and the fact he chose to do so says a lot. He is closer to this organization than anyone, and knew where the team was heading in the future. Will he win in Oakland? Probably. But that doesn’t change the fact he listened to multiple offers in search of a new home. The thunder have had an amazing decade. Two super stars, a rivalry with the Lakers (when they were actually good) “Beat L.A.!”, an amazing finals appearance when we were the young guns, and countless regular and post seasons to keep us engaged and energized.

KD best of luck to you, hope you find what you were looking for. 

So what’s next for Oklahoma City? I HATE, and I mean HATE!!!!, to say this; but I don’t believe it is Westbrook. He is my favorite player and I will root for this guy no matter what. But I think we all know that we will be having deja vu next summer. Without going to in-depth with the relationships, frustrations, and aspirations of everything that has transpired, I think it’s safe to say that Brodie is gone no matter what. I have faith that this has all come at a good time, and major credit to Presti and the front office. I truly believe the culture, grit, persistence, and fan base has made the Thunder who they are. We were blessed with two mega talents and numerous 1b players in Serge, Reggie, and of course Harden. Why? Presti is why. The fact that the dismantlement of our team leads to shifts in the NBA landscape speaks volumes about what the franchise can do. It’s not luck that we are here in this moment. Calculated risk and forethought have put this team in a position, while losing their “number one” talent, to still compete in the west. That’s amazing. Where do we go from here?
 
I hope it’s back to the days of Thunder U. What makes this franchise different is our belief and dedication to everyone on the squad. Did we get lucky, were the players just that talented, is it impossible to recreate? No, although the team grew over the last 8 years and the Thunder U label may have been lost, we are still that franchise. The grind and concur culture is still here even if we lost pieces. We have risen from ash before and will do so again. We are not the Lakers, Suns, Nicks, nor G State … desperate for an established super star to save our franchise. With that I begrudgingly hope we can acquire Brandon Ingram and D’angelo Russell and maybe a draft pick for Westbrook. Man that sucks to say. But Ingram can down right ball and it has always been young talent that has led this franchise. We have some amazing talent on the team regardless of KD and Russ, and can find the NBA’s next super stars as we have done before. The Thunder have birthed 3 of the top (debatable 5) but definitely 10 players in the league and have one more on the rise(love you Steven Adams, PITT!) They can do it again and maybe this time it will result in a chip. Let’s not lose sight of the greatness that has and will continue to be the Oklahoma City Thunder.

edit: Oak City to Oklahoma 
","Back to the beginning. In a good way. For the distraught: skip to paragraph 2

Enough with the Durant hate. Does it suck he’s gone? Obviously yes! Are we allowed to feel betrayed, hurt, frustrated, sad? Obviously yes! Hopeless…. NO! I won’t spend more than few sentences on this because this is not the point of this post. We all love(d) KD, he has been a legend to the city and the franchise. His decision to leave was his right as a player and a person; and the fact he chose to do so says a lot. He is closer to this organization than anyone, and knew where the team was heading in the future. Will he win in Oakland? Probably. But that doesn’t change the fact he listened to multiple offers in search of a new home. The thunder have had an amazing decade. Two super stars, a rivalry with the Lakers (when they were actually good) “Beat L.A.!”, an amazing finals appearance when we were the young guns, and countless regular and post seasons to keep us engaged and energized.

KD best of luck to you, hope you find what you were looking for. 

So what’s next for Oklahoma City? I HATE, and I mean HATE!!!!, to say this; but I don’t believe it is Westbrook. He is my favorite player and I will root for this guy no matter what. But I think we all know that we will be having deja vu next summer. Without going to in-depth with the relationships, frustrations, and aspirations of everything that has transpired, I think it’s safe to say that Brodie is gone no matter what. I have faith that this has all come at a good time, and major credit to Presti and the front office. I truly believe the culture, grit, persistence, and fan base has made the Thunder who they are. We were blessed with two mega talents and numerous 1b players in Serge, Reggie, and of course Harden. Why? Presti is why. The fact that the dismantlement of our team leads to shifts in the NBA landscape speaks volumes about what the franchise can do. It’s not luck that we are here in this moment. Calculated risk and forethought have put this team in a position, while losing their “number one” talent, to still compete in the west. That’s amazing. Where do we go from here?
 
I hope it’s back to the days of Thunder U. What makes this franchise different is our belief and dedication to everyone on the squad. Did we get lucky, were the players just that talented, is it impossible to recreate? No, although the team grew over the last 8 years and the Thunder U label may have been lost, we are still that franchise. The grind and concur culture is still here even if we lost pieces. We have risen from ash before and will do so again. We are not the Lakers, Suns, Nicks, nor G State … desperate for an established super star to save our franchise. With that I begrudgingly hope we can acquire Brandon Ingram and D’angelo Russell and maybe a draft pick for Westbrook. Man that sucks to say. But Ingram can down right ball and it has always been young talent that has led this franchise. We have some amazing talent on the team regardless of KD and Russ, and can find the NBA’s next super stars as we have done before. The Thunder have birthed 3 of the top (debatable 5) but definitely 10 players in the league and have one more on the rise(love you Steven Adams, PITT!) They can do it again and maybe this time it will result in a chip. Let’s not lose sight of the greatness that has and will continue to be the Oklahoma City Thunder.

"Here we are, fellow Thunder fans: our first great franchise tragedy! I guess that makes us real fans now.

Anyway, Durant has left the building, and it's obviously very painful for a lot of people, including me. It almost felt like a death in the family, and that surprised me. Not because ""oh it's just a game, who cares;"" getting emotional about sports is what makes sports so fun to watch.

I was surprised by how much it hurt. The Thunder haven't been here long enough for me to be as strongly connected to them as I am to more established Oklahoma teams, like OU football. So why do I feel as devastated as if Will Rogers rose from the dead just so he could spray paint ""Fuck OKC"" on the Memorial? 

Every city has a unique relationship with their team. After a day of mulling it over, I want to try and explain what Durant and the Thunder mean to OKC:

Before they showed up, our city was remembered in the national psyche for two things: tornadoes and the bombing. When I mentioned where I was from to other people, I knew the first image that came to their mind was a firefighter pulling a dying baby from the Murrah Building rubble, or a flattened neighborhood.

Throw in the history of forced American Indian relocation, and we were a city of tragedies.

And then the Hornets happened. Ironically, it took someone else's disaster in Hurricane Katrina to give us our first real chance at positive national attention. 

The success of the Hornets made us the potential destination for team relocation. Then, uh....the whole Seattle deal happened. Once again, another city's disaster was to our benefit. Life be stupid, yo.

In a few short years, the Thunder changed our image. People thought of us as a place where GOOD things happen! Fun things! Things that weren't depressing! Combined with the booming oil industry, OKC became a place you wanted to live. 

And Durant was the face of that optimism. He was a big time star who liked our quiet city. He diligently worked through adversity to keep getting better, to keep making the team better after each failed championship run, in the same way the city diligently works to rebuild after its latest natural disaster. 

He was more than just our favorite athlete. He represented the new OKC, the OKC that was worth staying in.

.....and then he leaves. That hurts.

I'm not mad at Durant. He can do whatever he wants, it's his career. He did incredible things for the city and owes us nothing. We were lucky to even have him in the first place. 

And it really is just a game. He didn't tank our economy, it was doing that just fine on its own.

But it'll take time to heal. It probably won't ever fully heal, but I truly believe the fan base will stay strong. We have way too much civic pride to just abandon the team now.

3. Just under 48 hours left on his right to rescission clause, so he's just doing this to get at them for beating us in the WCF.",27,13,Has Westbrook publicly said anything yet?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/4rezxw/has_westbrook_publicly_said_anything_yet/
"I think the perception throughout most NBA fanbases is that Seattle basketball fans hate everything about OKC and are happy to see Thunder fans suffer. That certainly is the case with some people here, but I think I speak for the majority of Sonics fans in saying that we have nothing against OKC fans. It was terrible to have our team ripped away and I absolutely resent the main culprits of the relocation (Mainly Clay Bennett and Howard Shultz). However, you guys shouldn't be held responsible for that.

"1.) We have yet to attract OR keep a significant unrestricted free agent.  This is scary for the future of the franchise.  Maybe it will change at some point, but so far, no significant name has chosen to come/stay here.

2.) We have one of, if not the best drafting GM's in the business.  I'm personally very nervous that if Russ is traded or leaves on his own, Presti might leave.  BUT assuming Presti stays, if we get a lottery pick for Russ and/or secure a lottery pick from a bad 2016/2017, there's no reason to believe he won't hit more home runs in selecting talent.

3.) Assuming Russ is also gone, OKC/Presti might want to alter the types of players they select.  Think guys like Kawhi Leonard personalities who are more low key, and more likely not to gravitate to bigger markets.  If we can draft an elite player of this mindset who stays long term, maybe we can finally reverse the trend of not securing integral free agents.

4.) I'm all in with Billy Donovan.  You could watch the shift of this team from Game 2 of the Spurs series through Game 5 of the Warriors series.  Yes, he made plenty of poor, rookie decisions early on.  But he flexed his muscles vs Popovich and Kerr causing them to scratch their heads on how to counter.  I believe he lead us to our most successful playoff run ever if you consider how good San Antonio and Golden State were this year.  He will be a very good if not great coach if also decides not to move on.  Hopefully Presti and him can work together to find good fits.  It really is a shame we couldn't get to see Horford in this lineup. 

5.) Now for a pipe dream: OKC is able to woo Blake Griffin home next offseason and retains Russ.

This is not an attack on KD's character because like I said before, I respect him and his decisions as a person. However Stephen A. Smith said it best when he called it weak. Durant straight up turned and ran away when he faced a tough decision and decided to ""jump on a bandwagon"" in order to get a quick ring.

I guess it's just really disappointing to think of Kevin Durant before as a genuine player to think of him now as a weak-willed, incapable leader. 

Perhaps the most devastating part of all of this is how he just abandoned a team that was built around him. A very capable team I might add. We were so close to going on a championship run several times and KD left it all behind, saying ""screw you"" in the process. 

I want to say that I wish him the best of luck but I just can't wish luck and good fortune on a snake.

"Let's talk about the OKC Thunder and where they go from here.

At this point, the roster is mostly defined. 

Likely starters:

* Adams (RFA after this year)
* Kanter (3 more years)
* Roberson (RFA after this year)
* Oladipo (RFA after this year)
* Westbrook (UFA after this year)


Rotation guys:

* Ilyasova (UFA after this year) - he may start over Kanter, btw
* Payne (3 more years)
* Morrow (UFA after this year) - he can technically get cut, but won't be
* Collison (UFA after this year)
* Singler (3 more years)

Bottom of the bench:

* McGary (2 more years)
* Sabonis (4 more years)
* Huestis (3 more years)

Probably not coming back:

* Foye 
* Mohammed

Outstanding roster questions:

1. Do we keep Waiters? The cap hold for him right now is 12 million. He'll almost certainly get an offer above that, so the question is whether we match that offer.

2. If we don't keep Waiters, what kind of player fills the last two roster spots?


This is a solid roster, with one superstar (Westbrook), one potential superstar (Adams), and a few solid role players. That's enough to be competitive, and this is a playoff team. I'd take this roster over the Rockets, for example. But I don't think this roster is good enough to beat the Cavs/Spurs/Warriors.

At this point, you need to identify two things:

1. Is Westbrook going to stay? If not, you HAVE to trade him. I don't want that. But you can't let him walk and not get anything back. This is why Ibaka got traded. He indicated to management he wouldn't re-sign, so the Thunder traded him for younger talent.

2. If Westbrook stays long term, is there enough young talent around him to grow into a title contender? I suspect not, but Oladipo/Payne have shown flashes of elite potential. They've also shown signs of being overmatched, but they're young players and that's to be expected. 

The problem is that this is most likely a middling playoff team. So, the draft picks they still have will not be in the lottery, which is where you generally find superstars. This is also a team that's going to have to spend a lot of money next summer to keep Adams + Oladipo + Westbrook. So, bringing in a big budget FA could be a real challenge. All three of those players will demand max contracts, because other teams will have the cap space to offer it to them.

If Waiters is renounced this off-season (or we don't match what he's offered), the Thunder have approximately 20 million in cap space for this year. That's enough for a single starter-level player, but what do you really want to do with that money? It's not enough for a max contact guy, if one was even available. Do you spend it just to spend it, and make next off-season even rougher in terms of balancing the books?

If you truly take a critical eye to the current roster construction, you're left with an inconvenient truth: if they don't trade Westbrook, they're probably stuck in the NBA's middle class for the foreseeable future.

Even worse: if they do trade Westbrook, this team is probably still too good to completely bottom out for a top tier lottery pick. 

KD leaving really put the Thunder in an awkward spot. They're in a better spot than Orlando was after Dwight, or the Cavs after Lebron, but it's still a really bad spot.

So, what do I hope happens? I hope we find the best available guy (probably Waiters) and push in our chips this year. Westbrook can single-handedly win games, and if a couple of the young guys take a step forward... maybe? Then we bring back the band next year and hope for a little luck.

What do I expect happens? I think Russ is gone. I think he knows that this roster, as constructed, is too much like those Nuggets teams a few years back under Karl: full of solid players, but missing the stars. If he plans on leaving in FA, I hope he is straight up with Presti and tells him that, so a deal is made soon. I guarantee that Boston + Phoenix have already called. They're armed with picks and young players, and they want a star. ","A critical look at the roster and moving forward Let's talk about the OKC Thunder and where they go from here.

Does he really want to head to the Lakers in a year?  The timing doesn't seem quite right given how young their core is, e.g. Ingram is only 18 and likely won't be at all-star level for 3-4 years.  By that time Russ will be towards the end of his prime, or maybe even starting to decline.

If he wants to go to LA then the Clippers seems like a better option.  Trading him for Blake would be appealing if we could pull it off, although it'd be complex given they already have CP3.

But maybe Russ just wants a change and would be happy to go to any potentially contending team.

"I figured I'd share my little (well it turned out to be long) story for anyone who wants to listen.

Growing up in the 90s in KCMO, I was all about MJ. Both of my parents were MJ fans, and I learned the game watching MJ. After he was gone, I had no players I wanted to watch. i played ball all the time, but couldn't ever get into watching it...

But wait, there's this kid in Akron who's being touted as the next great one. I start following this guy in his HS years, and I immediately become a fan. ""This guy is gonna do it. He's gonna be the next great one."" He gets drafted, and I'm finally watching the NBA on a regular basis again. He just seems like there's nothing holding him back.

Meanwhile, living in Big 12 country, there's this kid from Maryland going to Texas, who piqued my interest for personal reasons. He's supposed to be a phenom, so I take notice as he wrecks shop with maybe the greatest freshman season ever. As I said, I already had a personal reason to take notice of this young guy, so I immediately start following him, too. All of a sudden, I have two young guys I really love watching in the league.

Well, over time, the guy in Ohio starts to get more and more criticism over not getting over that final hump, and his last season coincided with my senior yr in HS. I've defended this guy to my friends for years at this point, and this has to be the year. Sure enough, he gets a phantom elbow injury and basically quits on his team in my eyes. I've had it at this point. My number 1 player lost a lot of respect in my eyes. My boy in OKC would never just quit on his team like that. From now on it's all about my boy in Oklahoma.

Sure enough, the guy in Ohio bolts down to Miami, and the shitstorm ensues.

***THIS STORY IS GOING SOMEWHERE IF YOU'RE STILL READING, I PROMISE!***

I decide to go to school down in Stillwater, back in the state I was actually born in, and now I get to be close to my guy in OKC and watch his games up close.

Sure enough, 2012 happens, and my guy is up against my former guy, who I had come to enjoy seeing lose and getting slandered. 

""Cmon boys, let's get this dynasty started.""

Well, my boy and his team lost, and this guy I had idolized growing up after MJ retired finally reached the mountaintop. 

I tried to reach back and find the kid that would have been ecstatic, but all I could find was anger that my guy in OKC lost.

Over the years, I have come to respect LeBron and appreciate the great player he's been. I even rooted for the Cavs last year after we were out, but I'll never quite be able to feel the joy I would have had if I had kept rooting for him over the years.

All of this to say, I know there is a lot of hate for KD on this sub right now, but don't let it cloud your true feelings of him if you really love the guy. I, for one, will still be happy for him reaching his mountaintop if he gets there. Will it be the same as if he won it here? Hell no, but he's still my favorite player, and I still wish him success if we can't reach the pinnacle.

Ok so my friend was one of those Lakers fan that were fans cuz of Kobe. He claims he is his favorite player. He didn't like any other team until the western conference finals. When okc was whooping Golden states ass he became an okc fan. Of course once okc choked I don't think he was much of a fan anymore. Then the finals started. He didn't say much about the finals until halfway through when he became a cavs fan. When cavs won the title he stayed with them. I called him out for being a bandwagon and he claims he is a cavs fan cuz kyrie was his favorite point guard. He's being a stuck up little bitch and this is his only excuse for being a cavs fan now. He just cant accept the fact that hes a bandwagon. Would you consider him a bandwagon? Answer honestly. Even if he wasn't ever an okc fan is he a bandwagon? ,Is he a bandwagon?

All this he can do whatever he wants etc etc. choking in games 6 and 7 not to mention a very average post season in general then he bitches out to their arch rivals. The team that literally repeatedly kicked us in the balls.

"I'm going to take a minor in-depth at the remaining Thunder roster and look into what this team needs to do or can do to keep rolling for the 2016-2017 season.

Let's start with the likely starting 5:

PG Russell Westbrook. 2015-2016 stats: PPG 23.5 RPG 7.8 APG 10.4

Make no mistake, this team is Westbrook's team. He had one of his best seasons last year, ranking eighth in points per game and second in assists per game in the league. Westbrook is a certified G and a bona fide stud, and you can't teach that! But, he is going to have to absolutely control the game, and that means cutting down on the turnovers. Yes, we know Westbrook will be Westbrook, and with him, you take the really good with the bad. But we will need a lot of really good this year. His supporting cast will be a big part of that.

SG Victor Oladipo: 2015-2016 stats: PPG 16.0 RPG 4.8 APG 3.9

One of the newest additions to the team is Oladipo. At 24, he's a got a lot of game left in him, and will be a welcome part of the team. He is a two-way guard who attacks the rim with the same ferocity as Westbrook, and can guard on-ball extremely well. Something this team will need is improvement on Oladipo's for jump shooting. Westbrook will be needing open shooters, and Oladipo needs to be able to knock them in, especially from 3PT, in which he averaged .348 on 3.9 attempts per game. Shooting will be a key need for this team. He will need to hit the J's.

SF Andre Roberson 2015-2016 stats: PPG 4.8 RPG 3.6 APG 0.7 

Likely moving over to small forward is one of the best on-ball defenders in the game, Roberson showed flashes of reliability in the Warriors series. Teams tend to forget about him on offense, in which he showed brilliant flashes of moving without the ball and getting open under the rim. He also showed slashing abilities in getting to the rim. Defense is never an issue with him, but for the Thunder to excel, he must continue to up his offensive game, and become more consistent from behind the arc. Also, if he is going to attack the rim, his free throw percentage (61%) also needs to greatly improve.

PF Ersan Ilyasova 2015-2016 stats: PPG 10.4 RPG 5.4 APG 0.9

I'm not even sure if Ilyasova will even start, but I predict that they will keep Kanter and Adams in different rotations to start. Ilyasova is a stretch 4 who shot 42% from the field and the 37% from three. Offensively, he will be close to what Ibaka was. But his shot blocking skills and defensive skills in general aren't as great. All we need from him is consistent points. 11-13 points a game and 8 boards would be ideal. He could be an unsung player on this team.

C Steven Adams 2015-2016 stats: PPG 8.0 RPG 6.7 BPG 1.1

Adams showed last season that he is a big time player. He's tough, consistent, and intelligent. His stats may not show it, but he is one of the most important players on this team. He alters any shots around him, making it difficult for other teams to drive to the hole. His IQ is also a thing of beauty, and he is one of the best passing big guys. Things he can improve on are his back to the basket play and possibly stretching his game outo a bit. But I expect his role and stats to shoot up significantly.

Bench

PG Cameron Payne 2015-2016 stats: PPG 5.0 APG 1.9 SPG 0.6

There's a lot to like about what Payne can bring. But boy, was he exposed in the playoffs. He had shaky decision making, turned the ball over constantly, and just plain didn't look ready for the big time. He averaged 12.2 minutes last season and will likely see more time. He needs to improve his court generally mentality, improve his shooting, and his defensive IQ if he wants to keep seeing minutes.

SG/SF Anthony Morrow 2015-2016 stats: PPG 5.6 APG 0.4 RPG 0.9

Morrows minutes declined in the playoffs. His overall minutes were almost cut in half from last season. Mainly due to him basically being a one trick pony. His three point percentage dropped from 43% in 2014-2015 to 38%. He may be trade bait as the season rolls on, but if he wants minutes, his 3PT percentage must rise, and he must find other uses in the game

SF Kyle Singler 2015-2016 stats: PPG 3.4 APG 0.4 RPG 2.1

What to say, what to say. How about this? Singler sucked last season. 38% from the field and 31% from beyond the arc is just not going to cut it for a role player who is expected to chip in points. Unfortunately, it looks like he will keep getting minutes. Let's hope he does better than last year. Or else it might be a long season when the bench keeps getting outscored.

PF/C Enes Kanter 2015-2016 stats: PPG 12.7 RPG 8.1 ORPG 3.04

Ranking high among 6th man of the year candidates, and well-deserved, was Kanter. His ability to put back second chance points and stellar back to the basket play earned him 21 minutes a game last season, a number that will definitely increase for this coming season. His defense, in my opinion, did improve, but it will need to get better if this team has any shot. His mid range game should continue to improve, and look for him to shoot more threes. He went 10-21 in the regular season

PF/C Mitch McGary 2015-2016 stats: PPG 1.3 RPG 0.9

After breakout games last year, McGary spent most of this last season in the D-League, where he averaged 14.7 PPG in 24.9 minutes. The kid has potential. He is a good stretch 4 who can finish strong at the rim. Yet, his defense is borderline abyssmal. It is likely he will get more minutes for this season. Will he take advantage? If he can and be consistent, he could be an integral part of this team. Or he may just be trade bait.

PF Nick Collison 2015-2016 stats: PPG 2.1 RPG 2.9 APG 0.9

Unfortunately, Collison may be on his way to having a permanent place on the bench. His minutes and productivity were cut last season. At 35 years of age, it makes sense. Though if he does play, you can expect the same hustle and bravado as he has had since years back. Don't expect much.

SG Josh Huestis 2015-2016 stats: Eh, who care?

Granted, he hasn't had much playing time at all for the Thunder. In the D League last season, he averaged 12.7 points in 32 minutes. He can play a little D, but this guy is likely to be bouncing back and forth from the D League his entire career. 

PF/C Domantas Sabonis, rookie. From his draft report, he is a hard working player, but isn't very athletic. Expect some D League stints, but in the long run, he could be akin to Collison when it is all said and done. 

Pg Semaj Christon: Having played in Italy and currently on the summer league team, Christon is a player to watch. He can score, currently averaging 17 points, 5 assists, and 4 steals in this year's summer league. A possible weakness is his 3PT shooting, but he could find a spot on the main roster via injury.

Alex Abrines: We will probably never see him.

SG Dion Waiters 2015-2016 stats: PPG 9.8 RPG 2.6 APG 2.0

Waiters is an restricted free agent who might be getting some big money now that Durant (insert expletives here) is not on the team. We know how bone headed Waiters can be, but we also saw how great he can be. In the playoffs, he was valuable. He slashed to the rim and hit open cutters. He hit big threes. he played surprisingly good defense. He can be great. With Durant gone, the need for shooters is huge. If he is on the team, he will be a needed cog in the wheel.

So there it is, our current roster. If you guys want to add some heavy during advanced stats or sabermetrics, feel free. But that's our team this year. 

Let's get ready.

"me when I first realized we traded dipo: http://i.imgur.com/MaD6L7L.jpg 

but now onto the serious part!

I am a life long Magic fan and a huge Victor Oladipo fan and while it really sucks KD is gone and obviosly Dipo isn't a one for one replacement here are some of his strengths and things he will really be able to contribute for you guys these coming years.

His ball handling is getting better every year and as a guy who has very rarely played the 1 in the NBA. He started with turnovers per game 3.2 in his rookie year and has quickly dropped it down to 2.1  he's solid enough to be someone to bail the ball out to if Russ is getting double teamed without being a liability. 

He also has seemingly endless energy, he averaged 4.8 rebounds a game this past year and contested just about every missed shot with whoever. He very seldom gives up on a play and is the kind of guy that can drain the clock in the last few seconds of a big game by getting an unexpected board near the end of the shot clock. Always runs in transition and is fully committed to hustle on every play regardless of the score.

Pretty much no fear of contact, while he doesn't have amazing court vision he is definitely the kind of guy that can judge his shot pretty well and has a quick release on the ball should he be unable to draw the foul he's good about getting the ball back outside before hes put in a compromising position by big men.

And last but not least what I think makes him such a great player and important member of the team is his explosive personality and ability to get everyone into it. Many times in Orlando we would be down after putting in our second unit, the first unit would come back sluggish and he would grab a steal and quickly breakaway to the hoop for a dunk getting everyone right back into the game, hes a natural leader that has no problem motivating his teammates on both ends of the floor regardless of the score. (I say regardless of the score because we got rekt many times this season lol.)

in closing, a few videos of some of my favorite plays from Dipo as a  player for the Magic and the closing of a chapter and beginning of another, best of luck to all of you in OKC and take care of him.

I hereby have no ill will toward ANY other franchise in the NBA for as long as this Warriors team is dominant. If someone like Pat Riley can put together a super team, fucking go do it. Take Westbrook if thats what it takes and give us something to rebuild on. But for god's sake dont fucking make this the right choice for KD.

"Not all titles are equal.  If he wins a ring or two, there are asterisks by them.  Just like Lebron's with the Heat, and the Heat were not the superteam this Warriors team will be.  This year was Lebron's first real title.  It will take KD years for that, and it will never happen at Golden State.

No matter what Kevin does, he gave this city more than we could EVER ask for. If you don't think so, just look at some 2005 photos of Bricktown and then go visit the same place this evening. Durant made this team, along with others, but he's the cornerstone of it all. He has brought great playoff runs, a Finals appearance, even an MVP to this city. No, he couldn't have done it without the great players he had at his side, but there is no chance our organization would have looked this great if we would've drafted Oden or something.

He's revitalized this city, put us ON THE MAP. He's given his all to this city from day one.

I think Durant will stay, but if he doesn't, he'll still go down as one of the most important sports figures in Oklahoma history, and he'll always be my Oklahomie.

Instead of being self-centered and narcissistic (acting like you're too good to make the same decision as KD), just be happy we've been blessed enough to have a guy like KD drop to the number 2 spot in the 2007 draft and shape this city into something great.

"This week, let's discuss free agent targets. The Thunder have been the most active team this off season.

We will host a weekly thread about the Thunder, give us a topic, and it shall be.

Topic 1: draft targets (turns out there are none b/c Thunder traded away their first and second round picks to Philly and Denver. Oh well, draft is June 23. Maybe there will be a trade that could involve the Thunder, although I doubt it.

We will host a weekly thread about the Thunder, give us a topic, and it shall be.

Topic 1: draft targets (turns out there are none b/c Thunder traded away their first and second round picks to Philly and Denver. Oh well, draft is June 23. Maybe there will be a trade that could involve the Thunder, although I doubt it.

"Let's say Dallas signs conley and whiteside, are they even a 5th seed in the west? probably not especially if Horford ends up in OKC - if Dirk can see that happening and him ending his career without getting a chance to win I could see him legitimately looking at other offers 

While GS might be a great spot for Pau, I think Dirk with Adams manning the middle would be the perfect stretch 4 for OKC
