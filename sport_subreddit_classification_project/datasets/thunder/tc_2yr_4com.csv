"Jaylen Barford is a Senior out of Arkansas. 6’3” and 200lbs, considered 74/100 in top 100 to be drafted.

I’ve watched Barford all year long along with the rest of the SEC quite a bit.

He is inconsistent at times with his shots, but he can pick and roll fairly well. He also gets very hot from 3 when he gets going. Barford and Macon were senior guards for Arkansas this year, and Barford is similar to Bobby Portis (maybe as not athletic) in the way he scored.

Would be a good guy to develop, and I feel could surprise a lot of people.

"What do y'all think about this trade scenario?

LBJ accept to join us and George opt in, but we gotta clear some salary space.
Sadly, Steve is the only expendable piece with a consistent contract.

- TRADE 1:
Steven Adams (24,1mln x 4) and 53th pick to Dallas
Finney-Smith (1,5 mln x 2), Matthews (18,6mln x 1) and 5th pick to OKC

(Dallas got 4,5mln $ from Trade Exception)

DALLAS PROS: 
- They get one of the best center in NBA. 
- Their appeal grow a lot in view of FA.

DALLAS CONS:
- They lose their pick that seems to be good.

OKC PRO:
- We stretch our bench with a defender wing and a veteran guard who can shoot 3's
- We can draft a big man like Jaren Jackson or Mo Bamba or Wendell Carter Jr. and move him in our starting lineup right away.
- We save 4mln$ from Salary Cap

OKC CONS:
- We lose a smart and consistent player like Steve.

TRADE 2:
Both Melo and LeBron opt in.

Cavs get Carmelo Anthony (28mln $) , Terrance Ferguson (2,1mln$), Kyle Singler (5mln$)

OKC get Lebron James (35,6 mln$)

 
The situation is as follows:

PG Russ (35,350,000 x 4)
SG Roberson (10,000,000 x 2)
SF George (20,703,384 x 1)
PF James (35,600,968 x 1)
C Bamba (3,841,000 x 3 + Option)

Bench:
Matthews (18,622,514 x 1)
Abrines (5,455,236 x 1+1 (QO))
Patterson (5,451,600 x 1+1 (PO))
Finney-Smith (1,544,951 x 1+1 (NG))
Dakari Johnson  (1,378,242 x 1 + 1 (QO))
57th pick (looking for a backup PG)

TOTAL CAP 2018-2019: about 138$ mln

We lose young players like T-Ferg and Grant, but the next year we got a future star like Bamba and more than 50mln$ cap (giving up on Matthews and LBJ) in order to rebuilt our team.

"With two years left on his contract and watching his team on the verge of collapse, it seems likely that Love will be traded away to clear up some space and start a rebuild. So in this hypothetical, let's assume LeBron leaving Cleveland (I'd put that at a ~70% chance).   
 
Why would OKC want Kevin Love? If we did get him, he'd likely start at the 4. Our lineup would look like WB/Robes/PG (or Grant if he leaves)/Love/Adams
  
* We don't have a backup center when Adams is out. Kevin Love would be a great guy to rotate from the 4 to 5 and put PPatt or Grant at the 4.  
   
* Love shot 42% from the 3 last season. Consistent 3 point shooting is of utmost importance for OKC, who've regularly gone dry and relied on Westbrook's magic to score  
  
* Piggybacking off of that last point, imagine the amazing spacing that we'd enjoy. Imagine that lethal WB/Adams P&R with Love at the key if Adams gets stuffed.  
  
* People give Love a ton of crap due to his poor defense. But we have 3 amazing (future all-NBA defense IMO) defenders in PG, Robes, and Grant, and then Adams, Westbrook, and PPatt who are all also above average at defense. If Donovan has done one thing right, it's his defensive schemes, and it resulted in OKC being one of the best defending teams this season until Robes went down. 
   
* This is a stretch, but having Love in OKC could help in us land LeBron. But if the Cavs trade Love before LeBron leaves, they'd have to be 100% confident they're losing him.  

* Westbrook and Love were roommates at UCLA. I'm sure they'd love to be teammates here.  
  
OKC is the perfect destination for Love, IMO. We mask his deficiencies and his strengths are much needed by OKC. Getting Love could also help PG decide to resign with us, as it's a great roster upgrade.  
  
Now what are the downsides? What will it cost us?  
  
* Ideally, we'd trade Melo. That's a big upside IMO, but he's gonna have waive his NTC to go the Cavs, who'll probably buy him out. I doubt he does that.    
 
* Idk about everyone else here, but I'm optimistically confident that Kanter opts out and decides to come back to OKC. He's hinted at it a few times on his social. If we get Kanter, there isn't much reason to get Love too. He may be cheaper and he already has the OKC team chemistry. 
  
* We don't have any picks till 2022 IIRC. This is probably the worst aspect of this trade. We'll almost certainly lose Abrines and/or T-Ferg, or possibly even Grant in a sign-and-trade, probably to the Cavs or in a three-way trade. 
  
* Love is nearing 30, has two more years in his contract, and is a bit injury prone.

"i know it's not probable, or maybe even logical, but lets say Lebron says he wants to end his career in OKC for some crazy reason. Obviously the upper management don't say ""na sorry no room"" there has to be a solution to this that doesn't include trading Brody, or PG13.

"I’m just curious about this and I’m not so sure how to explain it. When you think of every other superstar in the league, you can immediately list his strengths and faults. Harden is an incredible isolation scorer, but fails hard on defense, for example. Giannis is an athletic freak but can’t shoot the long ball well. Makes sense, right? So why, when the media talks about Russ, do they amplify the magnitude of his faults so much, and make it about narrative, rather than just the faults themselves? Every time he has a bad game, or makes a questionable decision, you don’t just hear that it was a bad game or a bad decision. The media is quick to pounce and say “That’s why KD left! He’s a cancer.” Or, when alleged stat padding presents itself (like in the final game against the Grizzlies), people say, oh his selfish stat padding is why KD left, he’s a cancer.” I don’t recall people judging Lebron’s shortcomings based off just the fact that Kyrie left him, or Blake Griffin’s poor play based on the fact that Chris Paul left him. The amount of videos circulating on YouTube about “the truth about Russell Westbrook” and talking about how KD left him for X and Y reason is absurd to me.

"I was listening to a podcast of his and he gave an interesting solution to the Melo issue. Give Melo an ultimatum. Tell him that if he ops into his player-option that he will play 6 minutes a game and come off the bench. Or they could begin buyout discussions. The buyout terms Bill gave were that the thunder would pay Melo 15M of the 28M he is owed. Allowing him to become a free agent and sign with a team willing to pay him the remainder of his deal (and possible more) or sign with a contender on a minimum or near minimum deal but have a shot at a deep playoff run. Of course in contract buyouts the player and organization must agree on the terms so we don’t know if that offer would be appealing to Melo but it’s something.

This move would allow the thunder to make a minor splash in free agency and give them something to look forward too.

I make this post with near certainty PG leaves. And if he ultimately does leave this move would give the thunder some freedom to make moves this offseason and sign some good role players and legitimate contributors. 

Thoughts?","Bill Simmons “Carmelo ultimatum” I was listening to a podcast of his and he gave an interesting solution to the Melo issue. Give Melo an ultimatum. Tell him that if he ops into his player-option that he will play 6 minutes a game and come off the bench. Or they could begin buyout discussions. The buyout terms Bill gave were that the thunder would pay Melo 15M of the 28M he is owed. Allowing him to become a free agent and sign with a team willing to pay him the remainder of his deal (and possible more) or sign with a contender on a minimum or near minimum deal but have a shot at a deep playoff run. Of course in contract buyouts the player and organization must agree on the terms so we don’t know if that offer would be appealing to Melo but it’s something.

"The season after Durant left, Westbrook gifted us the greatest individual regular season of all time and grabbed the attention of everyone, not just us Thunder fans. Instead of “let’s see what Kevin does”, everyone rushed to their seats to watch “what Russ might do.” A predictable regular season record of 60+ wins stolen by a lineup of basically half the Western Conference All-Star squad? Yawn. A triple-double might be averaged for the first time in 50+ years? Sign me up. Essentially, no one cared what the Warriors would do because it had no appeal, no surprise to it. 

And you know that ate at Durant. The same man who complained about always coming in second would (yet again) come in second. 

But it gets better. Let’s compare fanbases: one is comprised of half post-LeBron Miami “fans”, Silicon Valley geeks who recognized court-side seats might interest the wife, and preteens hellbent on worshipping repeated 3-pointers. The other is stuffed with dedicated men and women who wouldn’t miss a game even if the starting lineup became ill and couldn’t play one night. Which one sounds more interested in showing genuine support for their team and its players? 

You know that ate at Durant. “Hey, you play for the Warriors, right?” instead of “Hey, you’re Kevin Durant.” 

So enjoy that ring and possibly a second or third, but remember the entire experience is wildly tainted. Westbrook will always be loved more just as Curry will be.

"Now, in discussing the team and it's future/coaching/playing-style, etc, a lot of people have claimed that we more or less have to play this style of iso-heavy basketball because our personnel can't play any other way. Now, on the surface this maybe makes sense. Melo is guy who made his name on ISO, Russ has for better or worse built a reputation as a guy who always wants the ball in his hands, and PG while a great shooter had the ball a lot in his hands in Indiana. However, the stats definitely say otherwise, and while stats mean nothing without context, they definitely show that we probably aren't built to play isolation basketball.  
  
So this season the Thunder were second in the league in number of isolation plays at 11.7 per game. The only team with more were the Rockets with 15.6 per game, and the team right behind us were the Cavs at 10.9 a game. Now, for the bad wrap that ISO-ball gets, the Rockets had the best record in the NBA and the Cavs are in the NBA Finals. But the problem isn't so much that it can't work so much as the Thunder are worse at it that most teams. For context, the Rockets scored a league best 1.01 points per possession on ISOs. That's an outlier level of efficient for isolation scoring. The Cavs were a decent 0.91 PPP, good for ninth in the league. The Thunder? We were 23th in the league (0.82 PPP), only ahead of teams that are either known for hating ISOball (the Spurs, the Heat, the 76ers, the Nuggets) or team that are outright garbage (the Bulls, the Suns and the Knicks). And this was a direct reflection of our best players as Westbrook (0.82 PPP on 5 ISOs per night), Melo (0.89 PPP on 3.1 ISOs a game) and PG (0.87 PPP on 2.5 ISOs per game) were all below average at scoring against their man 1v1.    
  
Now, despite the fact we're known as an in-efficient ISO ball team, we still finished 10th in the league in offensive rating which means we must have been good at other things. The most obvious means of scoring for us for anyone who's watched us play is transition. Surprisingly we were actually only 15th in the league in this category with 1.09 PPP and average 18.3 transition plays per game which is 8th most in the league. Then you have our most common play type which is the Pick and Roll (NBA.com divides this into two categories which is PnR Ball Handler and PnR Roll Man). With the ball staying with the ball handler, we were 10th in PPP (0.86) and 9th in possessions (20.2 per game) while when hitting the roll man we were 6th in PPP (1.14) and 12th in possessions (7.8 per game). Now this is a staple of any modern day offense and with guys like Russ and PG we're pretty good at it, but not outlier level good.  
  
Surprisingly, the play type we were ranked the highest in this season was scoring off screens! We were 3rd in the league in this category with 1.09 PPP, behind only Golden State (1.13 PPP) and Cleveland (1.10). However, the Warriors used this action on 1057 total possessions this season (most in the league obviously) while we only used it 368 times (24th in the league). The few times the big 3 were actually used in this way they all excelled with Paul George getting the most possessions off screens (3.1 per game at 1.11 PPP) while Russ (0.3 per game at 1.14 PPP) and Melo (0.4 per game at a ridiculous 1.26 PPP putting him in the 90th percentile) made the most of limited attempts. The team was also average to above average in other less frequently used categories such as post-ups (9th with 0.91 PPP), spot-ups (17th but still 1.00 PPP) and cuts (16th but a very healthy 1.26 PPP).  
  
Now obviously this is a small sample size in some ways but it seems like we'd actually be better off playing a style closer the Hawks or Warriors than the Rockets or Cavs (or more simply the way we play now). Not just because that's the way the league is moving but because our players may actually be better at it despite what public perception is. The problem seems to be not ""our players can't play this way"" but more that they don't trust the new ideas of the way NBA should be played. Russ, Melo and PG all seem to be pretty old school guys, who love the idea of beating their man one on one and proving their superiority. But superiority isn't decided possession by possession, it's only true currency is rings. And if the OK3 want to move into the level of true contenders in year 2, a make-over like the one the Raptors underwent last summer from go from ISO-heavy two man show to more of a modern NBA offenses with lots of screening and cutting seems like the only realistic path.

"I don't think Larry Bird is an idiot.  But he has a point. I think you only keep the coach if you think he is the next Popp, Spoelstra, Phil Jackson, Carlisle. But if you don't see your players improve and team improve, 3 years is enough time.

https://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/nba/article/Larry-Bird-s-bizarre-three-year-rule-about-7397335.php

Bird praised Vogel's job as a head coach of the Indiana Pacers, but said that his decision not to renew Vogel's contract was made because coaches become stale after three years in their job.

""Just the history,"" Bird told reporters Thursday in Indianapolis. ""I've been around the history of the game for a lot of years. My experience has been, good coaches leave after three years. I played for Bill Fitch and I've seen it happen firsthand. I've talked to Red Auerbach on the subject a lot. We had K.C. Jones for five years. Nicest man I ever met. And they let him go. And we were having success.""

Bird arrived at Indiana as head coach and told everybody who would listen that he would coach three years at the maximum. And he lived up to it, leaving after three years despite leading the Pacers to the Eastern Conference finals all three seasons and a trip to the 2000 NBA Finals that remains the high-water mark during the franchise's NBA history.

""This goes back a long time ago,"" Bird said, reminding us that he knows what he knew. ""I've seen it. And after a certain number of years, it's time to make a move, and that's how I feel.""

""It's time for a new voice around here,"" Bird said. ""Sometimes my job really sucks and this is one of the toughest things I've done because of the respect that I have for Frank.

""I had time to think about it and watch the team throughout the year. I know a lot of you didn't expect us to make the playoffs, but obviously I have a lot higher expectations than most people about how our team should play and how far they should go in the playoffs and compete every night. I just came to the conclusion that I felt it was necessary for these guys to hear a new voice, but it's tough.""","Larry Bird has a 3-year rule for coaches because coaches become stale after three years in their job I don't think Larry Bird is an idiot.

"I think Billy Donovan is a good coach. He is better than Scotty Brooks imo and it is not particularly close. Let me illustrate this:

1. Billy Donovan has consistently shown that he knows the correct moves to make in playoff situations. He made the correct adjustments against the Spurs, and against the Warriors in 2016. I do not recall a single series in which Scotty Brooks started off with the right lineup. He played Perk way too much and spotted other teams a eight point lead in Q1 and he did this for every year since 2011. BD knew exactly where to hit the Warriors, designing our defensive schemes to stick the ball in non shooters hands, and ensuring we crashed the offensive glass. He did a similar thing vs the Spurs, and if not for the LMA explosion, we might have won in 5.

2.  Against the Rockets last year, we had a limited roster. Our team just wasn't very good. The fact that we were there at   
all was a testament to Russ. BD made the correct rotations, cut off Harden's driving lanes and thus it was a very ugly   
series. We had no shooting, and their shooters were bad, due in part to good defense.

Having said all that, the 17/18 season was a failure on BD's part and I'm going to try to elaborate why. The reason I mentioned the previous things were to show that he has shown in the past that he is an excellent coach.

Now I'm going to bring something up which will draw a lot of hate. Russell Westbrook is difficult to coach. Let me explain. What makes Russ special?

His passion, his intensity, his fundamental explosion and lack of control that pushes him over others. These are the features that make Russ the player he is. You cannot coach him like you would a Tony Parker or a Mike Conley. Russ is like a thoroughbred stallion, if you want him at his best, you must let him run free. You cannot stick him in one corner or have him run 20 PNR sets in a row. That isn't maximizing his impact.

In 2016/17, BD understood that this was the team's best way to succeed. It worked. However, I am still very angry at how the 17/18 season has turned out. Melo is not the same Melo, but this team, even without Robes, should have advanced a round in the playoffs. We were still a more talented basketball team than the Utah Jazz. So what happened? Here's another question\- why has OKC never had an actual offensive system? Under Brooks, Under Donovan\- it seems like freelancing. 

Well, the answer to that is that the coaches have always attempted to play to the strengths of the players. Durant and Russ are two unstoppable scorers. And guess what? The lack of offensive system ALMOST WON THE DAMN CHIP. Fundamentally, coaching isn't about some stupid principles of basketball. It is about communicating with your players, recognizing their strengths, their weaknesses, and making a system that suits them. There isn't a right or wrong way to play basketball as long as you follow these tenets. The best coaches only differ 5\-10 percent from the worst ones. That said, I believe the 17/18 season was failure at an organizational level.

We took 3 pieces with talent \(say what you will about Melo being washed up, but he has basketball talent\) and basically just flung shit at the wall. BD let Russ go last season, but now that he had two other teammates who could help, he didn't have the authority to rein him in. The team still played like last season. Why? Why was no adjustment made to the offense to account for PG and Melo? We say Melo has failed here, and he has been atrocious. But Melo is a player who needs rhythm to get going. He cannot be made a spot up shooter and succeed. PG luckily for us is a player who fits in well everywhere as he is a number 2 mentally.  But the simple fact is this\- a coach needs to understand how to manage egos. If BD cannot tell Russ anything and expect him to listen, that is a failure on part of both BD and Russ.  There are ways to manage egos.

Melo doesn't want to come off the bench? Yank him early on, and give him some accountability by running him out with the second unit. Make him feel appreciated, not marginalized. When we did this for a stretch, we started winning games!! This year, we went away from the principles that we had as an organization. That principle was\- above all\- play to the players strengths. We did not support Paul George and Melo to play to their strengths.

If Russell Westbrook cannot understand this, then we need to hire a coach he respects. I am disappointed in him. He was the MVP because he did whatever he had to to win. This is what makes him special. He didn't run away when the burden came on him. This year, he fell into a trap of genuine stat chasing. 

We can still absofuckinglutely win a title with Westbrook as the best player. But, we need not only complimentary pieces\- we also need Russ to understand that winning is not all about him, and every player on the entire team needs to have their strengths played to. If BD no longer has any authority, he needs to go. Sam Presti, you're my only hope.","Scotty Brooks, Billy Donovan And Russ I think Billy Donovan is a good coach.

"I know its unlikely because melo has no real reason to do so, but if the team tells him take the buyout or come off the bench he very well might do so, or let us trade him.

"If the Spurs were willing to accept an offer of Adams, Ferguson, Abrines and 2 x future 1sts for Kawhi Leonard (with assurance of him resigning) do you make the trade?

I know the big Kiwi is beloved and a perfect compliment next to Russ, but the unfairness of a Robes, Kawhi and PG (assuming he stays in this scenario) defense lineup would be insanity. 3 of the concensus 4-5 best wing defenders in the NBA (maybe the best 3) all starting on the same team would be something else. The length and switching ability 2 through 4 in that lineup would be unreal.

"Before he ended up coming to OKC reports said he only wanted to go to Cleveland or Houston. The trailblazers also became a rumored spot because Dame and CJ wanted him or something. I think these could be somewhat realistic trade options. 

Houston

Houston is most likely I think. The only reason Melo didn’t end up in Houston was because no one wanted Ryan Anderson’s contract. I think Anderson would be a good fit in OKC, he basically does what everyone wants Melo to do— stand in the corner and space the floor. I think Melo is a better defender but it’s not that much of a gap. Trevor Ariza could leave in free agency which could let Melo maybe even start in Houston.

Cleveland

This is contingent on Lebron staying, which I don’t think is likely. After the moves last year (basically signing every old guy for the minimum) failing, I don’t think it makes much sense for Cleveland but it’s possible. I think it would take a Kevin Love trade request to get done and even then I don’t think Melo and Ferg for K Love would beat out another teams offer. Basically, LeBron would have to demand a Carmelo trade to stay in Cleveland.

Portland

Portland has a lot of bad contracts, Evan Turner, Meyers Leonard, Moe Harkless. Trading off some of those contracts for one year of Melo may be worth it to the blazers. We could even potentially get a draft pick back as well. 

I think Melo could be an elite 6 man at this point  and hope he can come to terms with where he’s at in his career trajectory right now. But he’s a personality for sure and there may be a break up looming. Anything can happen, so let me know your thoughts :)

"Now, this isn't just me shitting on Russ. He's actually my favorite player in the league and probably my favorite dude in all of sports. But I was watching some highlights of him (because fuck every team left in the playoffs) and I've come more and more to the conclusion that Russ would actually be better off being a secondary ball handler on the team than the primary one. Or at least in a system with more of a team concept.  
  
First when I was watching his highlights I saw ""hey, Russ is actually pretty good on Catch and Shoot 3s"". So I went to find out his percentages on them, and then I ended up in a bit of a rabbit hole.  
  
Russ on Catch and Shoot 3s: 0.4/1.1 per game (36.0%)  
  
Only 1.1 per game so relatively small sample size but pretty good. In contrast, he's Russ on pull-up 3s.  
  
Russ on Pull-Up 3s: 0.8/2.9 per game (27.9%)  
  
So then I looked and realized most of Russ' inefficiencies overall come from the pull up mid-range. It's actually his most favored shot (10.3 per game) but he only makes 35.5% of them (3.6 per games). For comparison he takes 6.2 shots per game and makes 49.6% of them. The rest of his offense is paint touches (0.6/1.1 per game = 53.8%) and post ups (0.2/0.5 = 41.0%). So basically that crappy pull up midrange is the shot he takes most per game despite barely making it and if he cut down on those he'd be a much more efficient player.  
  
But then again I went deeper and looked at Russ' offense by play type. 
  
ISOLATION - 17.5% Frequency, 0.82 Points Per Possession, 36.4% FG, 42th percentile  
TRANSITION - 23.2% Frequency, 1.01 Points per possession, 55.2% FG, 33rd percentile  
PNR BALL HANDLER - 31.8% Frequency, O.85 Points per possession, 45.6% FG, 62nd percentile  
POST-UP - 7.0% Frequency, 0.83 PPP, 38.0% FG, 41th percentile  
SPOT-UP - 6.9% Frequency, 0.89 PPP, 39.3% FG, 34th percentile  
HAND-OFF - 2.9% Frequency, 0.67 PPP, 34.5% FG, 15th percentile  
CUT -1.2% Frequency, 1.30 PPP, 68.2% FG, 58th percentile  
OFF-SCREEN- 1.0% Frequency, 1.14 PPP, 45.0% FG, 79th percentile  
PUTBACKS - 3.3% Frequency, 1.05, 50.8% FG, 42th percentile  
  
So Russ's most used play type is the Pick and Roll which he's clearly good at, in the 62th percentile. But then what stands out is how bad he actually is in isolation. He's only in the 42th percentile and only at 0.82 points per possession even though he did 5 per game. He's also surprisingly inefficient in transition but he led the league in transition points and is 1.01 Points Per Possession so it's still good for him to get out and run although he should definitely work on his decision making in transition at times. But what else pops is the fact that despite barely doing them, he's actually pretty good off cuts and screens. If he played without the ball in his hands as much he'd be able use that side of his game and keep his high scoring numbers at a better efficiency. Cutting out the pull-ups and replacing them with more off-ball buckets would round out his game really well and open up things for everyone else.  
  
I know a lot of people have said this for a while but I just wanted to go thru the stats to see if it was a matter of Russ NEEDING the have the ball in his hands all the time to make an impact or not. And by my analysis the answer is clearly no. He and Donovan just need to trust leaving the ball in other guys hands and letting get back to him naturally instead of forcing it.  
  
TL;DR: Russ is surprising good at Catch and Shoot 3, terrible at pull-ups, terrible in isolation, surprisingly good at scoring off cuts and screens. Replacing all the bad pull-up shots with cuts and coming off screens would make him a more efficient player. Take the ball out of his hands a bit more and give more creative load to PG (if he stays) and Adams (who can grow into a Gasol/Horford-eqsue passer hopefully)","Russ should be more off-ball Now, this isn't just me shitting on Russ.

However with the  situation you guys are in(Melo,PG) shouldn't blowing things up be a possible route? It may be hard to hear but honestly can you guys win with westbrook leading your team right now? Even if you somehow miraculously add the right roleplayers? And don't get me wrong saying you can't win with westbrook isn't trying to be disrespectful, understanding the timeline for winning now isn't ideal is something every team in the NBA should be looking at due to the Warriors.

"If PG decides he wants to go to LA I wish him nothing but the best because at the end of the day it was never his choice to come here so he has every right to leave, and he gave his all and was great for us, and despite an awful game 6 he was great in the playoffs.

What annoys me however, is the way Lakers fans act as if they have already signed him, and dismiss the possibility of him re-signing here or joining anyone else, anyone feel the same?

Also it bothers me when they slander Russ to make OKC look like a less desirable destination for him, despite for years wishing he'd go back home and join them.

What do you guys think?",42,33,Unpopular Opinion (?),https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/8jkfnf/unpopular_opinion/
"I know r/thunder thinks KD is a snake for quitting on a team up 3-1 against GSW. We were up 3-1 because of KD's greatness. Hell, put KD on any team and most likely he would be able to win any series.

The problem was Golden State's brand of basketball. They were clearly unstoppable with their space and pace. 

Here's what I think were the key issues with KD's departure:
1) Replacing Scott Brooks for Billy Donovan. There was alot of lost continuity. Presti knew Brooks may not have been the best X's and O's coach. However, Brooks was the guy for KD and Russ. 
I don't know how you also replace Brooks for a college coach who ran a simplistic offense in college basketball. He had a pretty good trap defense and 3-2 zone. 
I would say that Billy Donovan would have been a great hire maybe post-KD. But not now. If they hired a former NBA champion coach or former NBA player that has been an assistant, they might have had more success.

2) Monty Williams was an unfortunate departure. Him + Billy was a good combo.
I think Monty was a good fit for OKC.

3) Presti has alot to blame for this. Heat and Cavs built around LeBron James. How do you win with LeBron? Just pair the guy with shooters. LeBron had Mike Miller, Ray Allen, Chalmers, Wade, Bosh on the  Heat. Cavs are all 3 point shooters.
Presti gave KD for several seasons locked up Westbrook and Roberson. For a player of KD's talents, it was just not a good fit for his brand of basketball. 
I really think if Presti found a starting shooting guard who was a knock down 3 point shooter KD would have stayed. It was clear that KD knew nothing would change. OKC will focus on length and defense. KD wanted to play with pace and space.

Alot guys might hate this post. But I actually enjoy seeing KD flourish right now. Alot more than James Harden who keeps flopping and gimmicking his way to score points and play no defense. KD should be all-NBA defense this year. ","Watching KD be unstoppable shows how Presti could not get the right players around KD.

"As we can see, OKC's defense quality dropped tremendously without Roberson on the court. We can see it in the first round of the playoff, nobody can actually locked down the rookie Donovan Mitchell. And Roberson is the biggest impact and he's giving his best effort for the team and that helps OKC a lot in the defensive side. He is fully passionate about defense and put in what he has on the floor. Besides, everyone just look at the offensive side of him without even noticing how good was his defense.

The defensive line build up by Roberson and Paul George are why the OKC can done their defense so well this season. Also, Westbrook did his best for the defense too, OKC have the most aggressive pressing defense on the court.

The value of Roberson is the defense, he's always there to lockdown the key man in the game, such as Kawhi, Harden, Klay or Curry. He has got the most aggressive defense which he'll always stick to the person and lockdown the person, this makes the attacker tough to do the offense.

By looking at the advanced splits as per NBA, he has got offensive rating of 106.5 per 100 possessions and defensive rating of 96.4 per 100 possessions which gives him the best net rating of 10.1  in the team. And this is the reason why without him, OKC will be so much difference this season, especially in the playoffs.

"Westbrook is virtually unstoppable when he is running at full speed, whether it is in transition or during half court sets when he suddenly explodes from perimeter to the rim. Defenses usually have no clue what to do in those situations, so they either end up taking a charge or committing a hard foul \(which might or might not be called\). This is where I think a floater comes into picture. If he adds this to his game, it becomes even a bigger headache for defenses to stop him. Is he going to drive all the way to the rim or stop and drop a floater? Now you could say that he can stop and make a mid range jumper.  I personally feel that floaters just need that forward momentum to be made \(unlike jump shots which need a proper form\). Also, he can rely less on those hard drives to the rim when fouls aren't being called on him. Other great guards in the league have some sort of floater to their game, whether it is Harden or Kyrie. Russell already has a solid  grasp on the offense, now if he could just add this to his repertoire, I think sky is the limit for him.

"Let me be clear. Sam Presti is a top 5 GM in this league. I am biased, but I do think that his intelligence, his creativity, and his dedication to his job is a thing of beauty. I was just thinking about his various transactions, and the thing that came out to strike me is that his decisions are almost always correct in the context of the situation, but external factors combine to fuck him over in an unfortunate way.

1. The Harden Trade- Look, we have all swallowed a bunch of crap on Reddit for this move. But at the time, we were screwed over by-
i. A cheap Owner

ii. The Rose Rule Grandfathering KD's contract- this is not talked about enough. Presti had his plans laid out in a specific way, but the financials were fucked over by the massive increase to the money owed to Durant

iii. Ultimately, we did not know that Harden would be a superstar. Allstar, maybe, but almost no one (including Darryl Morey) saw THIS out of him.

In the intervening period between the Harden trade and the KD departure, we had absolutely horrible luck. We were coached by Scotty Brooks (great guy, empowering coach but not a good coach) and suffered from a bout of horrific injuries in 2013, 2014/ 2015.

With Durant's FA only a year away, Sam had to do something to push us over the top. The Enes Kanter acquisition and contract have been criticized, but, ultimately, it allowed us to get something back for him. 2016 was the year we should have won it all. We had the most talented team, top to bottom in the league. Had we beaten the Warriors, we would have (in my opinion) given the Cavs more than they could have handled (especially on defense)

Durant left, and I am one of the few who do not fault him entirely for it. Look, everytime KD turns the TV on (and we know how much he loves hearing what people think about him, lol) he sees Charles Barkley being chastised by Shaq for not winning a chip. I believe in his mind he saw a 75 percent chance at contention with us, and a 100 percent chance with the Warriors. It was a weak move, but I get where he came from.

Anyways, Presti made some solid moves last year. Getting rid of a declining Ibaka, getting back Oladipo, the Taj Gibson midseason acquisition etc. Last year was a phenomenally fun season for me (and for most of you I think). The Russ show was more entertaining than I ever experienced during contention.

During the offseason, Sam Presti acquired Carmelo Anthony and Paul George. I was beyond hyped. Two (at the time) elite wings to go with Russ who could both score? We were at least in the second bracket if not overall contenders!

At the time, this move by Presti was Lauded. And you know what? I would do it 100 times out of 100. The most valuable commodity in this league is talent, and guess what, he got talent. Fit ultimately is what killed the chances of this roster, rather than the individual talents of the players (Except Melo, Melo is just washed).

I guess what this rambling piece is trying to talk about is that we need to have faith in Sam Presti. He is the one who is always trying to help us, and though it doesn't always work out, he is amazing at his job. Even if PG doesn't stay and our cap is fucked, I have faith that this man can find a solution, and you should too.","Sam Presti- The Tragic Genius Let me be clear.

"Dwane Casey had the balls to bench Demar Derozan in 4th quarter crunch time because he was 3-12. Demar is the number one guy on the Raps, even more than Kyle Lowry, but he was benched all the same when he wasn't performing up to expectations.

That would be the same as Billy benching Westbrook in the 4th quarter of a must-win playoffs game if he wasn't getting the job done. He finished the game with 28 minutes. That's huge. That needs some balls. And it almost worked.

"Okay now hear me out guys. There's two main arguments here. There's people who think Russ is the problem and then there's people who think Billy is the problem. 

Now let's say theoretically (because we actually don't know) that Russ is the problem. Then in my opinion no matter what I think it's up to the coach to discipline your players. Now even if Russ doesn't listen to Billy or follow his offesnict shemes then I still think it's on Billy. I mean if you don't have control of your players then your just not respected enough or have the authoritative power. If you can't do that then I believe your just a bad coach. Now this is all theoretically under the impression that the players don't listen to him.

Now we all know Billy plays the dumbest rotations. I feel like there truth to what melo said about how thunder didn't utilize him properly. I mean at the beginning of the season melo was running with the bench and then Billy switched it up to PG running with the bench which didn't work as well. Also Billy gave up alot of minutes to T-Ferg which imo could of went to 2pat or grant.

Now take in the game with GSW when they didn't have melo and Andre. Huestis is essentially a replica of Andre. He has the athletic ability but yet Billy didn't want to utilize him in later games. This is just poor coaching.

I mean you look at coaches like Brad Stevens and he's taking a bunch of young players to the semi finals. It's all about implementing a system and Billy just lacks that ability.

You guys all give him credibility about the WCF with Durant. Realistically even at that point OKC was still GSW kryptonite. Don't forget their biggest weakness is athletic bigs. Don't give Billy credit where credit ain't due. Any thoughts?","Billy is the problem Okay now hear me out guys. There's two main arguments here.

"Now first, I just want to say I've never been a coach at any level, I'm just an OKC fan who wants to see our offense get better (or more importantly, more organized). I've seen a lot of people talk how we should run a motion style offense ala the Spurs and Warriors but I've explained on here many times why IMO that can't work (not enough shooting, our players aren't great at passing). So then, I looked into other systems. The Triangle wouldn't work for us because it pretty much turns the point guard into an off-ball player, the high post offense would require Adams to be a better shooter, we can't play small ball with Adams, etc. However one system did seem like it could work. Spain's offense that they've been running for years.  
  
A lot of big NBA fans probably have heard of a play that has become very popular around the league called ""Spain"" or the ""Spain Pick and Roll"". [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3nHqWA3vJk) a video explaining it, basically the Spain Pick and Roll is the Point Guard receives a screen from the Center who THEN receives a back screen from a third player allowing him to roll to the rim. The third player then often flairs out to the top of the key.  
  
Now, despite the narrative than Billy Donovan never runs anything and we have no structured offense, this is actually something we've run A LOT. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTQUB5ZXUwQ) is a compilation of OKC running the Spain PnR during the 2016-17 (tbh I don't remember us using it in the 2017-18 system, and God knows watching us this season PG and Melo don't ever want to screen). Watching this compilation you can see how effective it is for Russ allowing him to get into the lane. One thing I will say is that outside of Abrines (who happens to be Spanish), the second screener always seemed to be the PF who would rarely actually flair out to the top. But theoretically, PG could be great as the flair out man at the top of the arc as that's one of his favorite shots (Patterson as well seems to like that spot).  
  
So that's the Spain PnR but what about the rest of the offense? [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpB8NVHidhE&t=12s) is the Spain Elbow series. Now we often see Adams receive the ball at the elbow but it almost always just leads to a dribble handoff. More cutting around Adams instead would keep defenses more honest and give us a different look. It would depend on Adams improving as a passer but I don't doubt he should be able to based on his intelligence as a player and rate of improvement every year. And it's easy to imagine Grant as the PF roll man on these plays with PG/Abrines coming around on the weak side for this action.  
  
Then we have stuff like [Spain Zipper Elevator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISjv57X0NVk) (which is just a variation of the elevator play with a zipper cut) and Spain running [Horns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HsxdL8UqA8) (it's a bit harder imagining us ever pass the ball this much on one possession) and here's just a [compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFSiUh5eh-w) of some other Spain run, but the bigger point I'm trying to get across is that with the personnel we have it is possible to run a system as long as we get everyone to buy in. It also feels like running this would get Adams a lot more involved in more than just rebounding which IMO is a good thing. Tbh, watching this it feels like Donovan does a lot of similar actions but the players don't really commit to running it (i.e don't screen hard or cut hard) but hopefully with more continuity with the roster we can have a fully formed offense and not just whatever the hell it is we do now. But the players have to buy in and Donovan has to commit to instilling it into them.

There was a 'plan' involved in bringing him over--he was supposed to play a stretch 4. Problem was though he has little lateral quickness anymore, is exploited on defense by basically every team in the NBA, walks the court, and b/c he can't drive effectively--defenders play him tight on D which severely affects his jump shot percentage.

"It seems like the one place and contract we could get Melo outta here for. I feel like as much of a dickhead we all know Melo is, the Heat may at least feel he's a reclamation project and he gets into shape under their regime he can be effective.

For us, it gets more complicated. The obvious problem is ""well we already have Adams"". But I think that for all the things Adams does well, we need a real rim protector because Adams just isn't that. And in the bigger picture, as much as I dislike Donovan as a coach, he loves two big line-ups (Horford and Noah, Kanter and Adams) and his best moments as coach involve two big line-ups (against the Spurs and Warriors). The problem with Kanter and Adams was that Kanter was just such a bad defender. But with Adams and Whiteside together we solve that problem. We wouldn't be able to run a ""modern"" NBA offense but we'd at least have an identity and work with what Billy seems to excel at. Instead of trying to copy trends, we could try to build our own style of basketball with just two twin towers, two great defensive wings in PG and Roberson and Russ as the athletic juggernaut.

"Just curious to see what Thunder fans think. I am biased towards pace and space and modern NBA offenses.

However, maybe OKC can reverse the trend and go with defense and bully ball.

IMO OKC will have to play Roberson off bench to run an efficient offense. Russ does not have a reliable jump shot.

Defenses do not stick onto Russ Adams or Roberson at 3 point line. So at any given point of time, there will be at least 2 or 3 defensive players in the paint. This makes it hard for an offense to create open shots.

I see a lot of shit posts on here. It takes MVP talent to score with two non shooters in Roberson and Adams. Name an NBA team and player that was efficient in scoring with a shooting guard that can't shoot with a center who can't shoot. Modern NBA offenses spread the floor. Okc is the opposite.

I just want to know what offense you would run with 3 non shooters on the floor with Roberson Adams and Westbrook. This job isn't easy.

I see a lot of shit posts on here. It takes MVP talent to score with two non shooters in Roberson and Adams. Name an NBA team and player that was efficient in scoring with a shooting guard that can't shoot with a center who can't shoot. Modern NBA offenses spread the floor. Okc is the opposite.

I just want to know what offense you would run with 3 non shooters on the floor with Roberson Adams and Westbrook. This job isn't easy. I can see triangle working a little bit if Roberson can pass well.",30,11,Can OKC run an offense effective for Russ with Roberson at SG and Adams at C?

"**Trade Idea 1**

*Charlotte Hornets Receive: Carmelo Anthony, Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr, 2019 OKC Second Round Pick*

*Cleveland Cavaliers Receive: Kemba Walker, Dwight Howard*

*Oklahoma City Thunder Receive: Kevin Love*

Hornets would do this as it puts them in a position to start tanking, rather than being stuck in mediocrity, and gives them some nice young pieces and a second round pick.

Cavs would do this as it finally gives them a proper rim protecter and this will give them someone that can carry the offense over than LeBron in Kemba, which will put them in a much better position to contend if they keep LeBron.

OKC would do this because Kevin Love is simply just an improvement on Melo.

**Trade Idea 2**

*Charlotte Hornets Receive: Carmelo Anthony, Frank Ntlikina, Emmanuel Mudiay, Alex Abrines*

*New York Knicks Receive: Kemba Walker, Dwight Howard*

*Oklahoma City Thunder Receive: Enes Kanter, Courtney Lee*

Hornets would do this because again, it puts them in a position to tank and gives them some nice young pieces.

Knicks would do this as it will give Porzingis the All Star teammate he's been waiting for, and Dwight can compliment him very nicely, and can help Porzingis out with rebounds which he struggles with. Also if Dwight doesn't work out he's expiring anyway and you can let him walk and still have Kemba.

OKC would do this as it finally gives them a backup Center, who is on an expiring contract so him being overpaid doesn't matter, also Enes would probably re-sign for cheaper. And OKC basically get what Alex Abrines will probably end up being in Courtney Lee.

**Trade Idea 3**

*Charlotte Hornets Receive: Carmelo Anthony, Marquese Chriss, Dragan Bander, 2019 Milwaukee First Round Pick (via Phoenix), 2019 OKC Second Round Pick*

*Phoenix Suns Receive: Kemba Walker, Dwight Howard*

*Oklahoma City Thunder Receive: Tyson Chandler, Jared Dudley*

Again, Charlotte would do this as it puts them in a position to tank and gives them some nice young pieces, they also receive a future 1st and 2nd.

Phoenix would do this as Devin Booker has made it clear he wants to start winning right now, and surrounding him with Kemba and Dwight, alongside Jackson and whoever they pick in the draft, would definitely put them in a good position to do that.

OKC would do this as they get Tyson Chandler on an expiring contract, who can fill the vacant backup Center spot, they also receive Dudley on an expiring contract who's just there to make contracts work.

"Now that the season is over, it is time to look to the future. The future hinges heavily upon what Paul George decides to do this summer.


Let’s say for the sake of argument he does not resign. That leaves OKC with a core of Russ, Roberson, Melo (more on him in a second), Adams and Grant. There are 2 paths OKC can take; play out next season as they wait  for Melo’s contract to expire, and probably get bounced in the first round of the playoffs; or try to trade Melo for better complementary pieces.  I think trading Melo without having to sacrifice an asset like Abrines or Ferguson is unlikely, so playing out the season with Melo on board is looking the more realistic outcome. In either scenario, OKC should be looking to devote greater minutes to Grant, Abrines, and Ferguson as they bridge the gap to the future.


Now let’s say Paul George does resign. That leaves OKC with the aforementioned core plus George. The next step is getting Melo to accept a bench role, which is better suited for his talents. If he will not accept such role, then the Thunder have to get him off the roster. 


Let’s say OKC does get Melo off the roster, whether it’s via trade, stretch provision, or a buy out. OKC would be putting out Russ-Roberson-PG-Grant-Adams, which has plenty of defensive capability stemming from the latter 4, while also packing a sizable offensive punch from Russ and PG. OKC can bring Abrines, Ferguson, Patterson, and (if he is resigned) Felton. This roster fits together much better, as the pieces complement each other much better than they did with Melo on the roster. Plus, this roster has greater financial flexibility, as it allows OKC to add role players if need be. ","The Way Forward Now that the season is over, it is time to look to the future.

I decided to go back and look at Billy D’s first press conference when he was introduced as the new head coach. This line really stood out to me. For all the ppl that question him, obviously he had the right idea coming into the organization, but somewhere it became lost.

It sounds to me like he has probably been implementing this, but guys just aren’t doing it. I definitely agree with people that say Billy is partially to blame for being unable to take command of the locker room and have them buy into what he wants. Hopefully we get some accountability on both ends (players and coach) going into next season. Players are looking at film and I find it hard to believe that they can’t see the difference when the ball is moving around more. This is why I feel like it really is them slipping back into old habits and I feel like it starts with Russ making a conscious effort. I’m not bashing Russ, because I understand the position he’s in. However, it’s a trickle down effect. He makes that change then the entire team does as well. 

I really hope guys work on that going into next season. A team can’t win a championship in the current NBA climate if they’re not playing team basketball and implementing more ball/player movement. I think this takes a lot more work than we realize though. A team can’t wake up and decide they’ll implement this and have it click right away. There’s definitely a huge amount of chemistry, trust and practice needed to successfully execute this.

"I think the only way to trade Carmelo would be to swap bad contracts with another team. One that comes to mind right away is Chandler Parsons with the Grizzlies. Parsons will be getting paid 24M next year, a similar number to Carmelo's 28M. The Grizzlies could cover any remaining gap in salary by putting in players with non-guaranteed salary who would be waived after the trade is completed.

This would be a mutually beneficial trade, as the Thunder get reclamation project in Parsons (who shot 42% from 3 last year) and the Grizzlies only have to deal with Carmelo's contract for one year before it goes off the books, while injecting some talent into their roster. The caveat to all this is getting him to accept a trade, as he as a no trade clause in his contract. 

Another option to get rid of Carmelo would be applying the stretch provision, spreading the remaining 28M he is owed over the next 3 years. That would would limit OKC's flexibility to upgrade the roster in the coming years, but would save 19M this year, thereby lessening the blow of potentially maxing out George and resigning Grant.

"I have have seen many people on this sub state that they believe that Billy Donovan is actually a good coach. I am wondering by what metric that can that be true.

1\. Offense

Our offensive system is non-existent. We just run iso and pick and roll and pray that our stars make something happen. Outside of that, there is little to no motion in the 3-4 other player that are not the focus of that possession. We never generate easy looks.

2\. Defense

Our defensive system is stupid. We switch one everything, thus leaving mismatches all over the court. We, by design, often have Adams switch onto a guard on the perimeter. Sure, our defense was good before Roberson was injured, but how could a defense be bad with two of the best three perimeter defenders on your team? Billy incompetence on the defensive end were exposed when Roberson got injured.

3\. Adjustments

How many times did we get our butts kicked in the third quarter? How often did we just keep running iso after iso, switch after switch without trying anything different? Other teams adjust, we don't.

4\. Rotations

Billy's rotations have been criticized all throughout his tenure as Head Coach. This has been defended as experiments for use in the playoffs, but, outside of one series against the Spurs two years ago, these ""experimental rotations"" have never borne fruit. Furthermore, obvious rotation such as PPat or Grant for Melo in the starting lineup were never attempted. This leads us to our next point...

5\. Accountability

There is no accountability on this team. Melo played like a corpse all year, but Billy never benched him. When Westbrook plays like out-of-control-brook, Billy never benches him. Billy has no control over this team, he's just a doormat to our stars. Until we get a coach that isn't a glorified yes-man, we will never take the next step.

Will keep updated as we go:

Sam opening comments :

* Sam is being really open and honest to start. Said he thinks we were just too inconsistent and think that caught up with us. Saying he hopes to keep much of the same core. Doesn't blame Billy at all because we've had 3 different teams the last 3 years.

* Sam is doing a lot of talking about Russ/PG. We're about 10 minutes in and no mention of Melo. He went on a little schpeel about Paul and talked about Russ + PG duo.

* Talking about Melo now separately. Said he's been a total pro and didn't want us to take his comments out of context and think he's been terrible. He was in it and committed. Says they'll talk more later. Interesting!

* Sam keeps talking about he wants to have the core come back. He referred to the core as Russ/PG/Steven. Very interesting!!

* He sounds very positive. Wants to see more out of 2Pat. Thinks Abrines and Jerami are good and thinks continuity is our best friend. Not happy where we're at but he's optimistic. 

Now taking questions:

* Someone asking why is Billy the one? Says he ticks off 3 things -- basketball coach that can adapt to a changing game with changing personnel -- Again says Billy needs continuity. Coach that can align itself with organizational culture. And third a coach that is basically just a good dude. Presti feels confident with Billy. Giving some pointers throughout his tenure as to why -- pointing at being 4 minutes away from WCF his first year mainly. 

* Billy is absolutely coming back. Someone asked right out.

* Plan B if Paul leaves? He is saying human beings are different (assuming he's talking about KD). No clue what Sam is blabbering about but he's saying we have to wait and see what Paul does. Convos with Paul thus far have been transparent and honest. Sam believes in people and wants to let the process play out to make a decision. Says they are prepared for all the different directions.  Going into how they built the team on the fly after Russ signed for 5 years and how he wanted to align a team with Russ' best years. Now believes the goal is to create a team that works for Paul/Russ/Steven's primes right now. Thinks we're in a good position if PG does not return -- likes his surrounding cast. 

* A question about Melo ( I didn't hear the question). Something along the lines of did Melo not enjoy himself. Sam is saying Melo basically has to decide if Melo doesn't want to play the role (so it sounds like we aren't going to fit him in more). Melo was open about his thoughts and we'll have to be honest back with him. Sam understands why he was frustrated. Sam promises the method if this takes time with the different convos (gotta be straight and honest) -- if he does want to come back, we all need to be on the same page. Says Melo was great for us this year (rattles off some numbers -- best starting lineup in the league). Sam sounds like he wants to see who comes back first beforehand.

* Asking about Melo's money now if he opts in. Sam says the dialgue has to happen about what Melo sees for his career and what he wants out of it. Thinks before we get to finance we have to get to the dialogue and open communication first. A lot goes into it -- lots of questions, talking to agents, lots of listening, etc. Believes they can sort it out and figure it out.

* How's Andre and what do we expect when he returns? It's a tedious rehab and it's a long rehab. Says it's important not to make Dre going down a thing -- thinks we should have adapted better to Dre being out. Likes Dre because he's competitive and does the stuff a lot of people want to do. Rattling off more numbers (Dre shot 55%) -- said he played really well. Says in our 20 or so close games, we really struggled in close games -- says we fouled way too much in close games and people shot the ball really well against us -- and says Dre makes a difference in those situations. Thinks he and Paul together are a problem (defensively) -- likes that duo. Says we didn't adjust well enough to his injury

* Question about trading for Paul (can't hear it-- they dont have a mic on the dudes) I think this is a question of finances. Sam says the only way the Thunder become a really expensive team is if Paul stays. Sam says they absolutely will be willing to pay that price. Says we have to look at in a 10 year span, not just year by yea. Talking about wins per contract, efficiency of winning vs cap used, we're top 3 in that 10 year period of time. We're middle of the league in our entire 10 years for how much we've spent. Had to extend Westbrook in his prime -- says the cost was worth it. Basically, saying spending all this money is not something we've always done but we want to keep Paul George. 

* More questions about finances and is it worth it for this team? Says he thinks we'll be a better team next year and rattles off numbers about how this team is better than last years. Doesn't think it's a tough decision to sign Paul.

* How pivotal is Russ' leadership? Can Russ still improve? How do you want he and PG to work if he stays? -- Sam says Westbrook is driven and he's going to keep coming. He's not going to kick his feet up and expect to comeback next year and expect things to be different. Thinks he's going to spend a lot of time thinking about things to get better. Sam says Russ wants to be a better 3pt shooter. Russ works on this late at night. Big part of his evolution. Sam says he's one of the best players in the league but Russ knows how to improve. Thinks we have to put him in those positions to enhance his effectiveness. 2nd most total wins in the last 10 years. And Russ has been there for all of it. FT shooting was bad but we still ended up 7th in offensive efficiency. Gotta find out why we weren't shooting that well this season. Rattling off more numbers (this dude knows his shit lol). Sam wants to take this into consideration and thinks we have to put everyone in better positions to succeed.

* he's going on a small rant about the free throw line. gotta shoot better.

* Russ q - how do we get more out of him defensively? Sam thinks we were 1 or 2 with Dre, thinks we can get more out of the everyone as we ended 9 defensively. Westbrook, PG, Dre, Adams and Melo were good -- when Dre went out, everyone struggled, not just Russ. Defense is not glamorous. The best defenses force the most inefficient shots. We turned people over but we didnt force into bad shots.Says knew that would be an issue because they tried to add more shooting this year (regarding rebounding). Again talks about continuity -- if we're able to bring the same group back, anticipation (with switching) and role definition will be better. The best defensive teams have continuity. Cerebral nature to defense. Want to be better than top 10, wants to be top 5.

* How did you feel about Vic and Sab? Sam wasn't surprised. Said OKC gave Victor that contract and we traded a good player to get Sabonis. Thinks it shouldn't be a reflection on us -- we needed to be closer to our goal. We were a 0 net rating team -- those guys were basically a bad fit for us and thinks they should stay in Indiana lol. Says he's really happy for those guys. Sam is saying the point of the business is to have a good feel on players. The fit for Vic is better in Indiana. Vic and Sab are great competitiors. Talking about Taj -- he was great in OKC but he works with Thibs. We want our old guys to do really well. We're really happy with the position we're in (were a +3 net rating team now).

* How do we sell PG on OKC/Russ and was the trade worth it? - We weren't going to have access to a guy like PAul without making the trade. Talking about building a team that works on a timeline with Russ mainly and Steven as well. Wouldn't be able to get a guy of PGs caliber without the trade. The foundation in year 1 is certainly optimistic. We get to build a relationship with him and such. Example -- you get an hour long FA meeting, but with the trade we get to show PG the best stuff about the organization and Oklahoma. Says it's nice to show that to a FA. Thinks the adversity was good because we had to just show Paul the real us. Everyone kept working and plucking. Everyone was working together -- said PG was a huge part of that. Said he was interacting and stuff. Said the dialogue between those guys was strong and that kind of stuff helps show PG who we are. 

* Jerami -- how do you feel about making JG restricted or UFA? Sam can't say much -- says 2 people have to cooperate with an extension (talking about last year). Said he didn't know what was coming at us. Says we thought Melo could be a stretch player but Enes and Doug were situational players so that was a fine trade to make financially. Knew we'd check in pretty high money wise -- could have been prevented but can still use JGs bird rights. Plans to have those convos. Excited about his development but gotta see what the market is.

* What objections do you hear about trading/getting players to come to OKC. Said there are no real objections right now. I think this is in reference to what he said about PG and saying we don't have an option to get players like that here. Is clarifying and you tend to draft guys as good as PG/Russ/KD. Have to add those pieces based on the timeline and have to trade good players to get good players. Said we're still working off something from 2008 (that time line?). PG was the best way to continue on that track from 2008. Thinks at some point yes we'll have to rebuild but we want to keep an elite team on the floor as long as possible. 

* Melo staying have anything to do with PG? Sam doesn't know. Thinks the guys have a really nice chemistry/bond. Doesn't want to oversell them as a group, but thinks in Melo's case he is just being honest about whether he feels like he can commit another year to playing this role. Appreciates Melo's candor. Otherwise, doesn't know what effect Melo's bond with PG will have on his next year. Sam again likes the foundation we have on a human level -- thinks the entire group is really connected. GOtta get stronger in the consistent areas. Gonna do what OKC does -- take where we are and compete and keep coming and keep our eye on the ball and figure out how to get better. Wants to get to another level. EVeryone has to want that.

* PG gone article? Sam says he talked to PG. Sam says PG likes to keep his business pretty in house. PG has been really straight down the middle. Sam cant do anything but trust the things he's been told. PG has said nice things about the org. Can't be cynical about any of this.

* Sam left but I think someone asked a question about Enes as he was leaving. Maybe it wasn't Enes? I can't tell. They're away from the mics. Oh I think he's talking about Felton? I can't tell sorry.  Sam is really still saying this group is really very connected and we handled defeat and victory really well. Said it was fascinating watching Ray connect with everyone. EDIT: The question was about getting Felton to come back. Sam basically said he really liked this group and he can't say whether he wants Ray to come back. Convo to have. Said Ray was good with connecting everyone.

* Fred I think asked a fun question about how did you like the local reporting lol. Sam said it was great. 

--Woo! fun times.

My personal summary:

Sam knows his shit and he made me feel a lot better about keeping Billy around. There were numbers Sam just rattled off that showed an obvious improvement from last year to this year. This is absolutely Russ' team and he wants to build a team that goes along with Russ' prime. Thinks PG fits with that very well and Adams and Dre are really good. It didn't sound like he was very confident with Melo staying. Other than being asked about Carmelo, he didn't talk about him much. Russ/Adams/PG/Dre were the main guys and it seems like Sam really wants those guys but he sounds like he has some ideas if PG does go. 

Same really has a point with the continuity thing and I'd be willing to watch this team again with a better role for Carmelo. It sounds like they aren't going to budget with Carmelo. Now, idk if Billy want him off the bench but they definitely want him to be a catch and shoot guy.

Some interesting things here, especially after the Zach Lowe article. Russillo is saying some of the same stuff but, he really *Really* doesn't like Russ and is blaming him for a lot.

Now I'm a huge Russ fan and after watching this season and last season, I have started to ask some questions. Because it's very obvious we need a system and why aren't we running one?

Anywho...Russillo talks about some things. SOme interesting points

* The organization loves Russ but basically feel like he's on a one man wrecking crew kind of mission and they don't really know how to handle this. They want to be better and do right but Russ basically wants to do what he wants.

* Russillo and his sources believe this is because Russ had early success in his career and just doesn't want to conform. Me personally, idk about this because I feel like he's changed. But he made a point about Game 5 and Game 6 -- He thinks Russ thought he could replicate Game 5 whenever he wanted and thus chucked up 17 3s in Game 6. Blames 5 points from PG on Russ.

* He does have a source that says he believes PG is gone. This was in no way concrete (so don't believe the hype on r/nba front page).  The other dude says Royce Young said otherwise and Russillo changed his tone -- said if Royce believes it then he believes Royce but basically that was all inconclusive.

* Believes Russ needs to get a team built around him like Harden/Lebron have. Role players and shooters and Russ is the undeniable guy. (I tend to agree with this as well). He says PG not staying is not a bad thing, especially if they can make this happen but there aren't really any more good 3&D players out there.

Then he got tired of talking about OKC lol.

"I am so tired of the media & people on social network blaming our failures on Russell Westbrook. There's not a player in this league that plays with as much heart as he does. He gives it his all every night. He's the kind of player that sport fans deserve. 

Over the years we've heard the following:

- He's a stat padder
- He's a ball hog
- He will never win a ring
- He's arrogant
 .. & more

I find it so disrespectful. Russell Westbrook isn't perfect by any means. We know that, the critics know that & more importantly, Westbrook knows that. That's why every year, he does his best to improve his game. 

People claim they always root for the underdog, is Westbrook not an underdog? He wasn't highly recruited out of high school. He was Darren Collison's backup in college. He worked hard to get where he's at. So for people to try to trash him, it's ridiculous! How can you doubt a guy that puts in so much work? More work then most critics ever put in in their lives.

Recently I saw this post about players doing better after they leave OKC. If I can remember correctly, I believe the list was: Kevin Durant, James Harden, Victor Oladipo, Serge Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, Domantis Sabonis, Enes Kanter & Dion Waiters. They're saying Westbrook held all of those players back. 

- Kevin Durant held himself back. He averaged more shots than Westbrook. He didn't play with any aggression. He didn't start doing that tough guy act until he went to GS. He was just as responsible for us blowing a 3-1 lead. Its easy to say he is doing better. He went on to win a ring with a team that went 73-9 the year before he got there. Yep, sure was Westbrook holding him back /s. 

- OKC's James Harden wasn't the same player as HOU's James Harden. Harden came off the bench for OKC. He wasn't getting as many fouls called for him either. Hell his percentages got worst since he left OKC. People like to blame Presti & the owners for not paying Harden the extra $3m, how about we flip that? He loved it here so much, why not take $3m less to stay? 

- Victor Oladipo was horrible with the Magic. Go look on espn.com & check out his numbers for yourself. He actually did better with OKC. Once he got traded to the Pacers, he became THE guy there. His numbers only improved slightly. Also he is in much better shape. He blamed his shooting woes on a wrist injury.

- Enes Kanter was on the bench for us. He started every game he played in for the Knicks. The only thing that improved was his rebounding. 

- Serge Ibaka has been on a decline since 15'. No need to even get into it.  Reggie Jackson was our BACKUP PG. He got traded to the Pistons because he wanted to start & get paid top dollar. Is he actually more successful? Hell no. Domantas Sabonis is being used the right way in Indiana. For some reason we had him shootin 3s. But, you would expect a player to get better after their rookie year. Dion Waiters was also THE guy for Miami before he got injured. 

So how does this have anything to do with Westbrook? It doesn't. If anything, people should look at the coaching staff. 

Westbrook doing something that hasn't been done in over 50 years makes him a stat padder. Averaging a triple double. Does that make Oscar Robertson a stat padder as well? He was the only player to ever do it before Westbrook did it. How do you stat pad assists? How do you stat pad rebounds? If it were that easy .. why don't other players do it? Did people call James Harden a stat padder when he was getting all those crazy stat lines? Also .. How can you be considered a ball hog & lead the league in assists? 

Supposedly people don't wanna play with Westbrook. Every former OKC player with the exception of Kevin Durant said nothing but great things about him. I'm gonna bring in 2 more players into this equation.

People have been saying OKC should get a pass first point guard & move Westbrook to SG. I don't understand why. ""He doesn't make his teammates better."" He's the PG & the star of this team. Truthfully, if he didn't take most of the shots he took, we would've lost a lot more games. But let me get to these other 2 players.

Steph Curry & Lebron James. 

Curry is GSW's Point Guard. What is he known for? Not making his teammates better. No, he's known for shooting 3 pointers. How about this .. Draymond Green, Yes GSW's POWER FORWARD, has averaged more assists than Curry for the last 3 seasons. We don't see no articles talking about Curry's inability to make his teammates better. I get it, they won a couple rings. They also happened to have perhaps the most stacked team in the league. 

Lebron James (King James) is known as 1 of the best basketball players ever.  They compare him to Jordan & Kobe. They say he makes his team better. Let's think of the stars he's had. Wade, Bosh, Love & Irving. Every last 1 of these players dropped like 10 ppg. How is that making them better? Most of their shooting %'s dropped or stayed the same.

It's confusing to me. Then you got all the bandwagon fans. ""I've been a Warriors fan since ..."" - ""Oh I've been a Rockets fan!"" - ""Cavs Nation!""

What ever happened to all those Laker fans? Heat fans? Celtics fans? Mavs fans? What happened to all of them? Let's not end up like them.

Russell Westbrook is by far my favorite player. He's the most entertaining player in the league to me. All the disrespect he's getting is uncalled for. It's coming from ignorant people or media members trying to make their show relevant. (I'm looking at you Colin Cowherd.) This team obviously needs to make some changes. I think we need to be more adventurous when it comes to coaches. Scott Brooks & Billy Donovan weren't the answers. They may be great guys but they aren't great coaches. We need a new coach & we need Sam Presti to get players that can score. All the defensive stops mean nothing if we cant score.

"*Via the NWS in Norman (updated 5/1 @ 12:30pm cst)*

 **...Synopsis and Discussion...**
   


   Convective coverage may be sparse through much of the day, given
   somewhat veered flow aloft, increased drying over far western
   Oklahoma, and weaker convergence along the dry line initially.
   However, as the low-level jet intensifies towards 00Z, a combination
   of increasing low-level shear, a moistening boundary layer, and
   steep mid-level lapse rates will yield a conditional threat for a
   few intense storms, capable of very large hail, damaging winds, and
   tornadoes. Still, considerable uncertainty exists regarding the
   potential for sustained convective development during the evening,
   owing to some of the issues described above. Moreover, similar to
   Kansas, counter-clockwise hodograph curvature aloft would support a
   few sustained left splits, interfering with the potential for
   longer-tracked discrete supercells. Considering these caveats, the
   ongoing enhanced is maintained with minor changes.

   As broader/stronger deep ascent overspreads the Plains (and a
   distinct corridor of low-level flow/moistening organizes to the
   west), a separate round of convection is possible from west Texas
   into the Panhandle and western Oklahoma Wednesday night. While the
   parameter space may remain favorable for tornadoes and large hail,
   continued dry air aloft, questionable mid-level wind profiles, and
   related mode issues may also yield upscale growth into
   eastward-accelerating bands, with damaging winds as the primary
   threat.

   few intense storms, capable of very large hail, damaging winds, and
   tornadoes. Still, considerable uncertainty exists regarding the
   potential for sustained convective development during the evening,
   owing to some of the issues described above. Moreover, similar to
   Kansas, counter-clockwise hodograph curvature aloft would support a
   few sustained left splits, interfering with the potential for
   longer-tracked discrete supercells. Considering these caveats, the
   ongoing enhanced is maintained with minor changes.

   As broader/stronger deep ascent overspreads the Plains (and a
   distinct corridor of low-level flow/moistening organizes to the
   west), a separate round of convection is possible from west Texas
   into the Panhandle and western Oklahoma Wednesday night. While the
   parameter space may remain favorable for tornadoes and large hail,
   continued dry air aloft, questionable mid-level wind profiles, and
   related mode issues may also yield upscale growth into
   eastward-accelerating bands, with damaging winds as the primary
   threat.

Notable quotes
>Regardless, the Thunder never provided Westbrook the personnel to go all-in on a spread pick-and-roll. In the draft, they erred toward defense, athleticism, and length, figuring they could turn college power forwards into wings and teach them to shoot. They have almost always had one nonthreatening shooter-- Roberson, Jerami Grant, Thabo Sefolosha, others -- mucking up driving lanes.

>They took a shot on Dion Waiters becoming the dream 3-and-D player. None of their bets beyond Adams since the 2012 Harden trade -- from which they are still recovering -- hit big.

>Oklahoma City's failure to develop an offensive system goes beyond Westbrook. But we have been talking about this problem for almost 10 years. The coach has changed, the bench has changed, the stars around him have changed.

>Westbrook's heart is in the right place; he wants to win, and when he takes a lot of shots, it is because he has concluded that is the best path to winning. More than one person described Westbrook's process as doing math while scanning the floor: he knows he can hit X percentage from this spot. A teammate can only do better if they are in the right spot, in rhythm, in the middle of a good game. Passing brings the risk of a turnover -- lowering the expected points per possession. There is a method.

>And for two straight years post-Durant, Oklahoma City's offense disintegrated with Westbrook on the bench. George couldn't reverse that trend. It says a lot about Westbrook's greatness, and the Thunder's shaky bench. It also stems from the Thunder's style: When one person is the system, the whole thing collapses when that person rests.

I think we can all say the season has been disappointing to say the very least,  and though I'm sure you've all heard this before, Billy D needs to be let go. To say the offense sucks is a major understatement,  but the defense (which BD is known for) is picked apart by multiple teams and seems to only work for some teams(GS) yet our coach makes no adjustment. 

A million things didn't go right starting with a major piece in Dre going down who held our entire defensive scheme together,  PG being inconsistent as usual,  Melo aging and definitely not working as a catch and shoot player or a ""we can't find a shot so here jab step for 15 secs"" player,  Westbrook not being able to check himself at moments, bench being atrocious at times,  overvaluing Tferg,  etc etc etc. 

But our hardest hit to our season was NO ADJUSTMENTS,  none at all.  And we suffered from an all ISO offence, gave the wrong guys minutes, and sent out horrid lineup after lineup every game. We switched every game and relied heavily on talent alone to drag us to the fourth seed. And if I hear BD say we played great but just couldn't hit shots I'll rip my hair out.  

Sadly just like his bestie BD,  presti will make no adjustments to the coaching staff and give him yet another chance when he should've been out in December.  It's sad that we're wasting WBs prime and PG is most likely gone  and if Melo leaves and becomes better in an actual offensive system they'll blame Russ and it'll suck ass and we'll have to deal with even more triple double jokes.

"It feels like most of the talk right now is all about Melo coming off the bench. Why does it matter if he starts or not? Let him start! All that really matters is who is getting the most minutes and who is closing. As long as Billy makes sure the right lineups are out there without worrying about feelings, let him start. He can start and still play with the bench unit, if that's what people really want. Starting is little more than symbolic. Am I wrong?","Why does it matter if Melo starts?

"Edit: what about Kevin Love?

This is a really sticky sticky kind of awful idea and ultimately I'd probably say no.

But when engaged Whiteside is really good. And he makes about as much as Carmelo and we need another center.

Obviously another wrench becomes who do you start? I think we may try starting Whiteside alongside Russ but still get Adams minutes with Russ but get Adams a majority of his minutes with a PG + bench lineup.

It'd be another risk and I think we are all out of risk taking time but I could see Melo maybe going to beautiful Miami to help his friend D Wade if he wants one last hoorah.

Just is a lot of risk with what is apparently Whitesides attitude issues.

"Hi Guys,

After enduring the season and watching the first lot of exit interviews, it got me thinking about the salary cap implications for next season. Obviously this season was disappointing, so it got me thinking whether the ownership would be willing to ""roll it back again"", considering the massive tax implications. Obviously OKC is a small market, so the owners probably can't afford to just bring everyone back. The Salary Cap is projected to be $101M next year, and the Luxury Tax Line is projected to be $123M. With that information in mind lets take a look at the salary's we have on the books for next year:

**Guaranteed 2018/19 Contracts:**

Russell Westbrook	  $35,350,000   
Carmelo Anthony	  $27,928,140   
Steven Adams	          $24,157,304   
Andre Roberson	          $10,000,000   
Alex Abrines	          $5,455,236   
Patrick Patterson	  $5,451,600   
Kyle Singler	          $4,996,000   
Terrance Ferguson	  $2,118,840   
Dakari Johnson	          $1,378,242   	
Total:                          $116,835,362   

**Potential Additional Contracts:**    
Paul George:               $30,300,000 (His max/30% of salary cap)   
Jerami Grant:              $8,568,000 (The projected non-tax payer mid level; probably what some teams may offer him)   
3 Minimum Contracts   $4,499,094 (3 x $1,499,698 contracts)    

**2018/19 Salary Cap Hit If Everyone Re-signs/Stays**   
**Player Contracts:**           $160,202,456 (if PG and Grant re-signs and Presti adds 3 players on minimum contracts)     
**Luxury Tax Payments:**    $157,515,350   
**Total Payments:**	           $317,717,806   

Obviously us fans aren't paying the tax and it would be great if the owners just paid whatever to keep PG and Grant, but that isn't realistic. Ownership obviously would not let Presti go that deep into the Luxury Tax. 

Presti could use the stretch provision on Melo and Singler and let Grant walk. Assuming Presti did this, and added 3 more minimum contracts in their place, the total numbers would be:   
**2018/19 Salary Cap Hit If Melo & Singler Get Stretched; Grant Leaves**      
**Total contracts:**                  $134,184,123   
**Luxury Tax Payments:**	       $30,394,432   
**Total Payments:**	               $164,578,555   

Obviously, there are a million things that the front office and ownership will explore, but I think it is pretty clear, that if PG re-signs; Melo will have to be stretched (assuming he's going to opt in to his $28M salary; which he would be stupid to opt out of). This would then hamper OKC's abilities over the next 3 seasons to make moves as they would still be paying 1/3 of his salary over each of the next 3 years.   

Sorry for the long spiel, just thought I'd crunch some numbers for some of the fans that may not fully understand the salary cap implications. I am by no means a salary cap expert, so sorry if I got anything wrong :).

"During last years Playoffs LaMarcus Aldridge played terribly on offense, to the point where he was even publicly called out by Pop to do more to help the team. As we all know he requested a trade during the Summer, and he and Pop sat down and agreed to shift the way he plays in the offense, and he just finished a fantastic year basically carrying the Spurs on offense all year.

Now I know Melo isn't as good as LMA, but both are volume, rhythm scorers who need to get multiple touches and shots to contribute consistently on offense. If they don't touch the ball for long periods of time they're more likely to miss.

If PG leaves Melo would naturally get more touches and be the clear 2nd option on the team with a more defined role.

I decided to follow them even though Clay turned out to be a two faced sonuvabitch to the seattle faithful which  wasnt surprising. I understand their pain, but I am not a local, I live in socal. Clay's promises to the city of seattle remind me a lot of KD's empty promises (and empty threats to reporters). That said, I was 99% sure KD was going to stay even when the real (woj) rumors came out (you can check my history, I was publicly called out here on reddit after he left because I made a post stating that he has no reason to leave). 

Thats all exposition. Fact is, if youre a member here then you are a thunder faithful so you will understand the pain in my subtext. 

Paul George should stay on this squad. Even if its a 1 year test deal.  I understand the negatives for him. He suffered a potentially career ending injury and probably wants security in a long term deal - but, lets face it this season was just weird. We looked equally parts amazing and putrid. We had moments of absolute terror and moments of pure joy and undivided hope for the future. 

That all came to a crashing halt this postseason as we all know. After seeing Carmelo outright reject the notion of a bench spot, I think we know where we stand. 

We will either have a squad with RW and PG next year, or we will have a squad with just Russ. Melo seems to be out of the fold and I believe either option would be better than a scenario with melo in the fold. Simply put, I was wrong about him and his attitude about what can win an NBA title.

"As many of you may know, Oklahoma has set a new record for latest tornado touchdown in recorded history for 2018. Looking at long range convective outlooks I'd like to start a dialogue on the likelihood of severe weather breaking out across the southern plains by mid week.


On Wednesday/D4, an upper trough will progress across the Four Corners states, with a belt of 60-70 kt midlevel flow and cooling aloft spreading into the southern and central Plains during the day. Meanwhile, low pressure will deepen over southeast CO, with a dryline from southwest KS across western OK and into northwest TX. To the north, a quasi-stationary front will extend from central KS into central IA and southern WI. Southerly winds will bring rich boundary-layer moisture northward across TX, OK, and into southern KS, with 65-70 F dewpoints over TX and OK.  

Thunderstorms are likely to be ongoing in a warm advection regime from eastern NE into northern MO, aided by a 50 kt low-level jet. This activity may reinforce the boundary, and or shift it a bit south. Precipitation by the models contain quite a bit of variance, with some models showing storms forming around 18Z over KS. Some of this may be an artifact of steep lapse rates aloft combined with moist mid to upper level profiles. In any case, high clouds may be a concern regarding heating as forecast soundings have consistently shown substantial high cloud potential. Still, 2000-3000 J/kg MUCAPE is expected across the warm sector due to robust low-level moisture and steep lapse rates aloft. Shear profiles will strongly favor supercells, including the threat of tornadoes and very large hail. ECMWF hodographs depict large streamwise vorticity in the lowest 1km with significant tornado potential across the 30% area. Storms should focus along the dryline and also the front/outflow across KS. Other severe storms are expected during the evening across west-central TX where a southeasterly low-level jet will exist bring moisture westward where temperatures aloft will be cool. Hail and wind is most likely there.

"After some of the awful calls in the Thunder/Jazz game last night, I’ve seen a some comments about robot refs that made me think a bit.

My guess would be that robot refs would be initially trained on data labeled from real referees rather than an explicit rules based approach.  We could specifically feed in only good calls and maybe take advantage of bad calls for training on negative examples, but outside of the last two minute report, this data isn’t available.  To provide unbiased data you would need to massively reduce your sample or spend a huge amount of time with teams of refs curating a data set, which doesn’t seem feasible.

With enough data the robots would likely call similarly to real refs (also learning biases).  If you train with the time of game as an input, it’s likely the robot refs would even learn to swallow the whistle at the end of game!  Even without the time as an input if there are any other patterns (more chaos/more intense defensive play, ect) that a neural net can pick up to indicate it’s the end of the game, this could happen.

One good thing that the robot refs could accomplish is increasing consistency. If the exact same call is made one way 60% of the time, then a deterministic algorithm is likely optimized by making that call 100% of the time.  Unfortunately, this could also go the wrong direction as if you naively use a mode based on vision, it wil be able to make models that are a function of which players are fouling/being fouled. Can you imagine how pissed you would be if 100%. James Harden gets a call and on the exact same play 0% of the time PG does?  

To be fair, these seem like the drawbacks of models being trained initially without feedback.  Initial training should get you decent models and then you can put these in games (without using their predictions) and just provide feedback to its decisions to push it in the right direction.  You could also have coaches provide feedback and also could have these referee team scrimmages to give them more feedback.  Hopefully, with not too much direct supervision you could get the robot to a threshold where it’s calling fouls similarly to a real referee with more consistency.","Robot Refs After some of the awful calls in the Thunder/Jazz game last night, I’ve seen a some comments about robot refs that made me think a bit.

"Obviously the Donovan experiment has been a disappointment, with this season being the pinnacle of it all. His first year he had the most talented team the Thunder has ever had (Prime KD, Westbrook, Ibaka, Adams, Kanter, Robes, Dion) and he choked off a 3-1 lead in the playoffs. After KD left he posted on Twitter (in the well known controversy) that he didn’t like playing for Donovan. It is now obvious that last year BD completely underutilized Oladipo and Kanter, which lead to two trades that made us both older and have risker contracts. This year was a failure, as we had all hoped we would be contenders and instead we just got knocked out of the first round again. It is a fact that every year this team has been coached by Donovan that we’ve been DEAD LAST in the league at pass per game. Which literally leaves us with the most stagnant offense in the league. Anyone that was upset about Scott Brooks offensive schemes should be doubly made about Donovan’s madness on offense.

So it’s clear it’s not working, what do we do?

We hire a coach that lead the Hawks to 60 wins (most games we’ve ever won in a season) when their best player was Al Horford! The man is so talented that he coached up role players just to have them leave in the offseason for a big paydays (see DeMare Carroll). 

How could we get such a coach? Well there is a connection, I’m not just dreaming up nice fantasies. Everyone knows Presti got his start as a scout in San Antonio. Well it’s also important to note that Presti worked with the Spurs the same time Budenholzer was an assistant coach under Popovich! I’m hoping that Presti is calling Mike as I type this, this move could turn this franchise around! Imagine having the coaching ability of Budenholzer and the team building of Presti! They’ll be the next Batman and Robin! ","Anyone else feeling the Presti/Budenholzer San Antonio connection?

"Celtics fan here. Just curious, no animosity towards your team nor your fanbase, I just feel like throughout this entire season Billy Donovan realistically did nothing to make sure that this Big 3 worked out. Immediate issues that come to mind is Westbrook being hard to coach in terms of transitioning from lone superstar with the ball in his hands 95&#37; of the team to being more team oriented & finding the right playstyle for the entire team while also finding the right formula for who gets the most shots/who get's plays ran through them compared to the other \(in terms of the big 3\). Similar to a big assignment due at the end of the year, this is something that you can't procrastinate on, it's a tough project that needs a lot of attention and you can't just hope that it all figures itself out. Well like most of us during our days in a School System it seems that Billy Donovan either did nothing or tried to do something when the team was already out of his control. TBH you could see these issues back when he first joined the team, sure it was a change of pace from Scott Brooks but there was no clear improvement \(at least from my perspective, obviously it would be nice if ya'll could shed some light on the topic if im just completely off\). 

Anyway, in the games where they played well and looked like a top tier defensive team with 3 unstoppable superstars, I think that could potentially be every game or at the very least more than what was had this season. I feel like in a perfect world you keep the whole team together for one more year and pick up someone like a Marc Jackson or Kevin Mchale, or hell even take a chance on a Kenny Smith and try to make a real run at something. The two things I hate about this situation is 1\) we, as fans of great basketball, will never get to see the true potential of this team and 2\) most of the blame by those who don't really follow the Thunder will primarily put the blame on Westbrook rather than understand the tough situation they were in as a whole. At the end of the day it's really a failure on the entire organization, but I'd place the bulk of the blame on Billy Donovan. Even if you didn't have that influence over the team before, even during Westbrook's MVP season, change needed to happen and this team needed to be guided to success like all the other successful big 3's. \(Doc Rivers and the Celitcs, Erik Spoelstra and the Heat, Marc Jackson and Steve Kerr for the Warriors\) I hope this team doesn't end up breaking up, or at the very least I hope you guys keep Westbrook and continue to build around him. 

What are your thoughts?","Thunder Fan's Thoughts on Billy Donovan? Celtics fan here. Just curious, no animosity towards your team nor your fanbase, I just feel like throughout this entire season Billy Donovan realistically did nothing to make sure that this Big 3 worked out. Immediate issues that come to mind is Westbrook being hard to coach in terms of transitioning from lone superstar with the ball in his hands 95&#37; of the team to being more team oriented & finding the right playstyle for the entire team while also finding the right formula for who gets the most shots/who get's plays ran through them compared to the other \(in terms of the big 3\). Similar to a big assignment due at the end of the year, this is something that you can't procrastinate on, it's a tough project that needs a lot of attention and you can't just hope that it all figures itself out. Well like most of us during our days in a School System it seems that Billy Donovan either did nothing or tried to do something when the team was already out of his control. TBH you could see these issues back when he first joined the team, sure it was a change of pace from Scott Brooks but there was no clear improvement \(at least from my perspective, obviously it would be nice if ya'll could shed some light on the topic if im just completely off\). 

Anyway, in the games where they played well and looked like a top tier defensive team with 3 unstoppable superstars, I think that could potentially be every game or at the very least more than what was had this season. I feel like in a perfect world you keep the whole team together for one more year and pick up someone like a Marc Jackson or Kevin Mchale, or hell even take a chance on a Kenny Smith and try to make a real run at something. The two things I hate about this situation is 1\) we, as fans of great basketball, will never get to see the true potential of this team and 2\) most of the blame by those who don't really follow the Thunder will primarily put the blame on Westbrook rather than understand the tough situation they were in as a whole. At the end of the day it's really a failure on the entire organization, but I'd place the bulk of the blame on Billy Donovan. Even if you didn't have that influence over the team before, even during Westbrook's MVP season, change needed to happen and this team needed to be guided to success like all the other successful big 3's. \(Doc Rivers and the Celitcs, Erik Spoelstra and the Heat, Marc Jackson and Steve Kerr for the Warriors\) I hope this team doesn't end up breaking up, or at the very least I hope you guys keep Westbrook and continue to build around him.

"I jumped on OKC bandwagon as a long time Carmelo fan, I wasn’t born in US, moved here to SF a while ago thus I don’t have any personal or emotional connection to the city, I’m just a basketball fan who likes jump shooters like Dirk, TMac, Melo, Steph etc.

I find it extremely weird that Carmelo is underperforming and to be honest quite a lot considered his contract and what he’s known for, do you guys think he’s simply just regressing ? I mean we are talking about a guy who makes a living on his jumpers, the guy scored 50 points against the Heat on purely jump shots, he scored 23 points in a quarter, scored 62 in 3 quarter and a half and like 50 of those from jump shots, he’s been doing for 15 YEARS, fuc I think he’s even worse at layups than jump shots.

It breaks my heart to see him performing disappointedly though I cannot deny the fact, so I wonder what are the thunder fans arw thinking about him? What actually happened to him? Any basketball fan feel free to answer and state your opinion, I want to see him do well and win a ring before he retires.

"Obviously the key here is to get Gobert in foul trouble early, and keep Adams out of foul trouble, which is easier said than done. 

We need to start Grant over Melo, and have Russ and Grant hit the paint hard in the 1st to get Frenchy McDefense in foul trouble, or at least space the floor considerably. The pick and roll was working in the 2nd half, but we can't be too reliant on it because Snyder will adjust and take the rug out from under us. 

Defense is obviously a thing, and I think Huestis needs to be involved. His length and lateral quickness was working for a bit and we should capitalize on it. PG *has to make Ingles a non factor*. I know it's a lot to ask to have him dialed in on defense *and* on offense, but this is another elim game and we just need him to do it. We can't afford to be jingled with those corner 3s anymore. 

Russ has to focus more on Mitchell without ignoring Rubio. I think having Russ and Brewer share the task is the best plan. Steve has to be a paint guardian and get those mother fuckin rebounds.

"Hey guys,

I've been a long time lurker here but didn't make an account till after that crazy game last night, and that is the game I want to talk about. 

There were two things that let us win the game and (going forward) might help us win the series. The first was Gobert's foul trouble. As soon as he collected his fourth foul and subbed out, it allowed Westbrook and George to get into a scoring groove. By the time Gobert came back, Westbrook was blazing hot, and George and Westbrook had both realized that they could go at Gobert and not be afraid of getting swatted. The 3rd quarter scoring binge was a result of hot shooting and was not really sustainable, which is why I was terrified heading into the fourth.

The second (and key) factor that let us win the game was the great team defense we played in the fourth. We outscored the Jazz 27-21 which isn't a huge difference, however, we won because of Jerami MOTHAFUCKING Grant. This man didn't put up offensive stats, but it was his inclusion in place of Melo that allowed us to play a quasi version of what Roberson gave us, energy, hustle, and the ability to get steals and move quickly in transition. Shoutout to Alex Abrines, who isn't a talented defender, but worked his butt off and was a huge help. 

How we can use this going forward-

I know Billy D will have to start Melo due to politics, but he needs to pull him unless he's super hot. Hot shooting from Westbrook and George will not always happen, but we can take advantage of the fact that the Jazz only have one really scary dribble -penetrator. We have to defend with energy and push in transition- that is the only way to beat Gobert. It is unlikely that he will get the same foul calls he got in this game in Utah.

Ultimately, we have to believe in this team. Let the offseason come when it comes, until then we have to FIGHT every damn minute and believe in this team. 

Also, shoutout to Donovan Mitchell- I am fucking scared whenever he gets the ball, and he has played great defense too. ","A call for Defense - Why we won the game, and why Melo cannot play more than 25 mpg Hey guys,

"3 things. 

1) yes I’m prepared for the downvotes

2) I’ve been on and off the trade Westbrook bandwagon since the KD leaving offseason. 

3) I am asking the question wanting the best for the franchise.

So today we found ourselves 25 points down within the 3rd quarter, when Russell and Playoff P went insane (led by Brodie) and brought as back for an inspiring win. The OK3 haters have been silenced, but if we get knocked out they’ll be back. So during the quiet I ask you, what do we need to do to get back to the top. 

Something hasn’t been right with the team since the year that KD left and it has been hard to figure out what the issue is.

Russell isn’t the reason players leave OKC. Harden wanted the be one of us forever, KD was a snake and the rest of the crew were not key pieces anyway. And Russell doesn’t make players worse, Oladipo is a big fish in a small pond, that’s why he looks good. In the same way Isiah Cannon looked good in Philly 3 years ago.  Paul and Melo both seem incredibly happy within the franchise and with each other,  he’s not chasing them away. All that crap is just media hype #FakeNews

However, our performance this year has been less than what we were hoping for. People say things like “Westbrook’s uncoachable” and that “he doesn’t listen to Billy’s plan” but can we blame OUR real MVP for that? 

In focusing on tonight, was it poor execution that found us 25 points down, and Billy’s great coaching saved us, or was it Billy’s poor coaching that got us 25 points down, and Russell that saved us?

It’s hard to say, the numbers were down during the 1st half and the 2nd was just a show of class by 2 superstars. 

If you think Billy is a good coach and the players aren’t performing, then Russell should go, because Russ won’t be fitting the direction of the club

If you think Russel is keeping us relevant despite Donavans coaching, then Billy needs to go, because even though today’s win was amazing, the fact that we needed a performance like that to win, shows that something isn’t working.","Billy or Russ, which one should go 3 things.

3) I am asking the question wanting the best for the franchise.

So today we found ourselves 25 points down within the 3rd quarter, when Russell and Playoff P went insane (led by Brodie) and brought as back for an inspiring win. The OK3 haters have been silenced, but if we get knocked out they’ll be back. So during the quiet I ask you, what do we need to do to get back to the top. 

Something hasn’t been right with the team since the year that KD left and it has been hard to figure out what the issue is.

Russell isn’t the reason players leave OKC. Harden wanted the be one of us forever, KD was a snake and the rest of the crew were not key pieces anyway. And Russell doesn’t make players worse, Oladipo is a big fish in a small pond, that’s why he looks good. In the same way Isiah Cannon looked good in Philly 3 years ago.  Paul and Melo both seem incredibly happy within the franchise and with each other,  he’s not chasing them away. All that crap is just media hype #FakeNews

However, our performance this year has been less than what we were hoping for. People say things like “Westbrook’s uncoachable” and that “he doesn’t listen to Billy’s plan” but can we blame OUR real MVP for that? 

In focusing on tonight, was it poor execution that found us 25 points down, and Billy’s great coaching saved us, or was it Billy’s poor coaching that got us 25 points down, and Russell that saved us?

It’s hard to say, the numbers were down during the 1st half and the 2nd was just a show of class by 2 superstars. 

If you think Billy is a good coach and the players aren’t performing, then Russell should go, because Russ won’t be fitting the direction of the club

If you think Russel is keeping us relevant despite Donavans coaching, then Billy needs to go, because even though today’s win was amazing, the fact that we needed a performance like that to win, shows that something isn’t working.",7,0,"Billy or Russ, which one should go",https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/8f0xeh/billy_or_russ_which_one_should_go/

"Whether we win tonight or not, this has been a very disappointing team. I feel like we can all agree about that.

It's easy to blame Presti in hind-sight, but we are in a huge predicament right now and I'm having a hard time seeing the silver lining.

The best case scenario is everyone re-ups and we try it all over again. But are we still a disappointing team, especially with this coach? Will BD have the balls to bench or play Melo 20-25 minutes a game? Will we implement an offensive style that gets all the guys in rhythm and plays with some pace? Will we play guys like Abrines over Ferguson? You know what I'm saying. What's the worth of this team with this current leadership/style?

Worst case scenario is PG leaves along with guys like Grant. We basically become the team from last year, but without Kanter (not unless we keep Grant) and without a back-up PG. We probably continue to get bounced in the first round unless Grant/Abrines/Ferguson make a major fucking leap.

Middle case scenario is a rebuild. I hate to see Russ in other colors and I don't know if he'd get the right kind of haul, but if PG leaves, perhaps let those guys go too and just rebuild. The West will be wide open in a few years in my opinion. There's no one on the Sixers/Celtics level of rebuild. Everyone in the West wants to try to compete right now. Kings/Memphis/Suns all have terrible FOs and I think OKC could probably still catch them.

"I constantly see our ball movement and our isolation\-heavy offense being criticised and I understand that. It's easy to get mesmerized by teams with less talent moving the ball wonderfully and generating easy shots for everyone. Whether you like it or not, though, that's not us. We have WB, PG13 and Melo, all of whom are players who thrive with the ball in their hands, and all of whom are able to generate high\-percentage shots by themselves. Adams and Brewer finish up the lineup, and neither of them are playmakers who should have to make too many decisions with the ball.

Creating a ball movement\-heavy system where everyone gets touches and there are tons of cuts and action just isn't our thing with this personnell.  If you don't believe me or Donovan, look at Popovich and what he did with LaMarcus Aldridge. For almost a season he tried to fit Aldridge in to their system, when Aldridge had played a massively different role for his entire carreer. That didn't work and Pop backed off, he let Aldridge do his thing, and he's happy and better utilized again.   An other example of iso\-heavy offense working is of course The Rockets. There's one key differense between their system and ours, and it's not ball movement, it's spacing.

So ball movement's not our problem, it's spacing. Watching the games and going through the replay, I constantly and constantly see possessions where 3, 4 or even 5 guys are inside the threepoint line. An other problem is our lack of off\-ball movement and action, so the defenders can just ball\-watch and sit in the paint.

Here's a few examples with poor spacing, execution and lack of off\-ball movement:

* In one of our playcalls there's a screen with wb and melo on the side, and an off\-ball screen on the other side for PG. This gets us possibly one of two things, a contested melo pull\-up midrange or a PG shot from an off\-ball screen. Both are outside jumpers and very easy for the defense. [https://imgur.com/KmMTwrs](https://imgur.com/KmMTwrs) In this example westbrook ended up attacking the screen, obviously ending up in a TO.
* Here's an example of laziness or whatever, but just poor execution. There's no reason for Melo to be standing inside the three\-point line. This way the defender can help Rudy out without leaving melo open. This ended up with PG missing a lay up, contested by Rudy. [https://imgur.com/JO3sjVp](https://imgur.com/JO3sjVp)
* In this one, a classic example of a play that is horrible in every way. Abrines doesn't hit the screen, which makes it completely useless, there are 4 guys standing inside the three\-point line, and WB ends up saing fuck it and chucking up a contested three\-pointer. [https://imgur.com/rNxTJdx](https://imgur.com/rNxTJdx)
* Even in transition, our spacing isn't there. Here, I'm not sure if WB should pass it to Melo and we get a Melo lay\-up or a Grant three, or if Melo should just RUN and cut of the way. Perhaps Grant should also be in Melos spot, as they can't help off of Melo as much. In the end this ends up as a missed layup between 6 guys, including 3 of ours.  [https://imgur.com/rwBU8qe](https://imgur.com/rwBU8qe)
* In this instance, the problem is not spacing per\-se, as Grant ends up cutting out of his position \(mind you, jogging\) but everyone standing still. Look at the Jazz defenders, they can't even see their own man! And they don't have to, because we have no off\-ball movement, or cuts that have a purpose of getting someone open. [https://imgur.com/C2KM2up](https://imgur.com/C2KM2up)

Here's some positives that I was able to find.

* Here, on the other hand is our 5 out lineup, and an example of excellent spacing that reminds me of the Rockets. We even have a secondary action on the other side which WB could turn to, if he couldn't for some reason attack Dante all alone \(which he did, succesfully\). [https://imgur.com/p6ncFqA](https://imgur.com/p6ncFqA)
* Here's the famous WB and Adams pick and roll. This is an example of meh spacing imo. It did generate a basket for Adams, and at least Melo's not standing inside the three\-point line, but I would like to see Melo and Brewer at least switch positions or something to take the defenders a little bit more out of the paint. [https://imgur.com/XahOyGz](https://imgur.com/XahOyGz)

So that's a very quick look at some of the problems. I'm not a coach or expert by any means, but these are some examples that I saw when going through the tape. I didn't go through the whole game when replaying, so this probably isn't even the worst examples. I hope this gives you an idea of the things that are problematic though, IMO. Like said, I'm no coach so I don't know what OKC should do to fix their offense, but the one's where guys are standing in the paint for no reason \(Melo...\) should be very easy to fix. Hopefully the Thunder can turn the switch and execute on offense for the rest of the series. Thunder in 7 amirite?","Our problem is not ball movement, it's spacing I constantly see our ball movement and our isolation\-heavy offense being criticised and I understand that. It's easy to get mesmerized by teams with less talent moving the ball wonderfully and generating easy shots for everyone. Whether you like it or not, though, that's not us. We have WB, PG13 and Melo, all of whom are players who thrive with the ball in their hands, and all of whom are able to generate high\-percentage shots by themselves. Adams and Brewer finish up the lineup, and neither of them are playmakers who should have to make too many decisions with the ball.

Creating a ball movement\-heavy system where everyone gets touches and there are tons of cuts and action just isn't our thing with this personnell.  If you don't believe me or Donovan, look at Popovich and what he did with LaMarcus Aldridge. For almost a season he tried to fit Aldridge in to their system, when Aldridge had played a massively different role for his entire carreer. That didn't work and Pop backed off, he let Aldridge do his thing, and he's happy and better utilized again.   An other example of iso\-heavy offense working is of course The Rockets. There's one key differense between their system and ours, and it's not ball movement, it's spacing.

So ball movement's not our problem, it's spacing. Watching the games and going through the replay, I constantly and constantly see possessions where 3, 4 or even 5 guys are inside the threepoint line. An other problem is our lack of off\-ball movement and action, so the defenders can just ball\-watch and sit in the paint.

Here's a few examples with poor spacing, execution and lack of off\-ball movement:

* In one of our playcalls there's a screen with wb and melo on the side, and an off\-ball screen on the other side for PG. This gets us possibly one of two things, a contested melo pull\-up midrange or a PG shot from an off\-ball screen. Both are outside jumpers and very easy for the defense. [https://imgur.com/KmMTwrs](https://imgur.com/KmMTwrs) In this example westbrook ended up attacking the screen, obviously ending up in a TO.
* Here's an example of laziness or whatever, but just poor execution. There's no reason for Melo to be standing inside the three\-point line. This way the defender can help Rudy out without leaving melo open. This ended up with PG missing a lay up, contested by Rudy. [https://imgur.com/JO3sjVp](https://imgur.com/JO3sjVp)
* In this one, a classic example of a play that is horrible in every way. Abrines doesn't hit the screen, which makes it completely useless, there are 4 guys standing inside the three\-point line, and WB ends up saing fuck it and chucking up a contested three\-pointer. [https://imgur.com/rNxTJdx](https://imgur.com/rNxTJdx)
* Even in transition, our spacing isn't there. Here, I'm not sure if WB should pass it to Melo and we get a Melo lay\-up or a Grant three, or if Melo should just RUN and cut of the way. Perhaps Grant should also be in Melos spot, as they can't help off of Melo as much. In the end this ends up as a missed layup between 6 guys, including 3 of ours.  [https://imgur.com/rwBU8qe](https://imgur.com/rwBU8qe)
* In this instance, the problem is not spacing per\-se, as Grant ends up cutting out of his position \(mind you, jogging\) but everyone standing still. Look at the Jazz defenders, they can't even see their own man! And they don't have to, because we have no off\-ball movement, or cuts that have a purpose of getting someone open. [https://imgur.com/C2KM2up](https://imgur.com/C2KM2up)

Here's some positives that I was able to find.

* Here, on the other hand is our 5 out lineup, and an example of excellent spacing that reminds me of the Rockets. We even have a secondary action on the other side which WB could turn to, if he couldn't for some reason attack Dante all alone \(which he did, succesfully\). [https://imgur.com/p6ncFqA](https://imgur.com/p6ncFqA)
* Here's the famous WB and Adams pick and roll. This is an example of meh spacing imo. It did generate a basket for Adams, and at least Melo's not standing inside the three\-point line, but I would like to see Melo and Brewer at least switch positions or something to take the defenders a little bit more out of the paint. [https://imgur.com/XahOyGz](https://imgur.com/XahOyGz)

So that's a very quick look at some of the problems. I'm not a coach or expert by any means, but these are some examples that I saw when going through the tape. I didn't go through the whole game when replaying, so this probably isn't even the worst examples. I hope this gives you an idea of the things that are problematic though, IMO. Like said, I'm no coach so I don't know what OKC should do to fix their offense, but the one's where guys are standing in the paint for no reason \(Melo...\) should be very easy to fix.

"Unless they come back and win this series (and the way they gave up last night, I don't even see them winning game 5), I think Billy Donovan gets fired, (please) and possibly Sam Presti too. Nothing about this team has worked at all, and now we're staring years of mediocrity (at best) in the face. 

I'm almost tempted to want them to just blow it all up, hire a GM that can team build as well as draft, hire a coach that will put in some kind of system and force Russ to play in it. Let Russ have some input on who they hire, and put in a system that works with what Russ is naturally good at, but make it clear that he will have to adjust to whatever coach/system they put in place. If he won't do it, trade him and go full tank/Process. 

Presti has drafted well in the past as far as talent goes, but he can't seem to put the pieces together for a real team, and I think the sheer talent level we had for several years masked that. Even if PG stays, we're in cap hell with no draft picks, and there's next to no chance we get rid of Melo this off-season. If PG does decide to stay, maybe we should keep Presti on, but I feel like I've seen enough. 

It looks like this run is over. /r/NBA and the national basketball media hate Russ, the Thunder, and Oklahoma/OKC as a place. I don't think there's any digging out of this without blowing it up and starting over. I hope I'm wrong, though. Maybe Seattle will get an expansion team and people can at least stop shitting on us for that.

If we were to hire a new coach and GM, who would you like to see? I don't have anybody in particular in mind to replace Presti as GM, but I wonder how Jay Wright from Villanova could do as coach. Maybe give Ettore Messina a shot otherwise? Or maybe there's some other young coach I'm not aware of that could pull a Spoelstra or Brad Stevens.

"The stigma of going down 3-1 is seen as really bad as it's usually the team with home court advantage is down 3-1. But in our case we need 3 wins from 3 with 2 of them being at home. Obviously easier said than done but if we take care of business on home court tomorrow, then we just need 1 upset and it's game 7 on our home court.

Sick of seeing people act like the series is over already, if we eventually to get eliminated then be as pissed as you want because we have underperformed, but until then at least try and be optimistic.

**2013**: yeah whatever, we lost Harden but our record was even better  
**2014**: holy shit we got Reggie Jackson we don't need Harden, Spurs just got hot but we'll be better next year

**2016**: well we choked incredibly hard, but at least we know we can compete with GS, we've got Dipo now for our third playmaker, we'll be better  
**July 5th 2016**: well whatever, even without Durant we're a playoff team and we'll be able to sign someone good  
**2017**: Holy shit we got Paul George LET'S FUCKING GO!!  
**2018**: Well......

We've always had young talent who were projected to get better. I don't think Adams is going to get much better. Westbrook is only going to get worse. Melo is already terrible and can only get worse. Abrines isn't going to be good. Grant is gone. Paul George is gone. 

There's literally no chance we can be better. We gotta blow it up and start over. Drafting is Presti's best attribute, we have to just rely on him again to bring us YOUNG talent. 

Can't blame him for going all in this year, but goddamn, just a little bit of our young talent (Kanter, McBuckets) would go a LOOOOONGG way to making us better if we were able to keep PG. Since we have no young talent, we have to start over.

"Hello. I'm a Pistons fan. My team is not in the playoffs so I had to pick one (because basketball kind of sucks without a rooting interest). There are a lot of teams I could have chosen from; Dame and CJ are awesome and fun to watch so I could have gone with Portland, Minnesota was a great story, Utah has honorary Piston Donovan Mitchell (neverforget), the Wizards are so dysfunctional and yet so talented that I can't look away, etc... I think it was an interesting playoffs with a lot of interesting teams and not a lot of sure outcomes.


But the choice, ultimately, had to be OKC. And that is for reasons that go beyond basketball. OKC's team construction and play style are in and of themselves a declaration of war against modern basketball thinking. And as someone who dislikes modern basketball thinking (and more than anything: dislikes the proponents of modern basketball thinking), how could I choose any other team?


I've been taking a lot of L's recently as far as sports goes. Lions hired someone who I have zero faith in (and which smells of ""our GM hired his old drinking buddy from New England""), Red Wings and Pistons may each have the worst cap situations of their respective leagues, and Tigers are tearing it all down and it seems Miggy will never win a chip in the D. But this is all tribalistic nonsense. This, in all honesty, takes a backseat to the cultural war that is taking place in basketball.


And I think this war ultimately boils down to: do you enjoy basketball when it's on a spreadsheet or do you like, you know, actually watching it? Do you like basketball players who are jabbing and slipping like Floyd or do you like basketball players whom you are not sure if they even have a jab (the basketball Roy Jones Jr)?


I personally, go for the latter. Every time. Give me hatred. Give me spite. Give me a mountain of salt. I don't care; I am watching a human sport, not a computer Sim. This is the reason I love Russ and John Wall, and why I loved A.I. when he was playing even after his horrible stint with my team. These guys are certainly not the darlings of the basketball snob class. Both of them are flawed. Both of them can make bad decisions with the ball. But if you are anything but completely attentive, engaged, and excited when you're watching either of them run a fastbreak... then you hate basketball and also you're no fun.


I want the Thunder to win because of what it represents. It represents an L for the basketball female auxiliary (who are not a part of the basketball world but nonetheless feel inextricably connected with the modern current of thinking and treat it as their dogma), and it represents a W for what I call ""human basketball.""


Maybe I don't make any sense, I don't know. But I just hope these last three games were an aberration; that this team is too talented to get bounced so quickly and unceremoniously.

"Yes , the situation is really shitty right now. We are losing to a team led by a rookie we expected to beat. But several things
1) People including me underestimated the Jazz , they were the best team down the stretch in league , Donovan Mitchell is somehow that good at 21 and they have a lot of good pieces. Its also a bad matchup for us with Gobert taking away what Russ is best at.

2) Our shooting has been absurdly bad its probably Utah’s but we have missed so maybe good looks the past 3 games so maybe we can get into a hot shooting streak we can win the next few games. PG and Melo have shown they can make shots in streaks. Even russ is much better usually at his mid range.

3) Donovan should not be fired! Sure he is flawed but the stale offense is not his fault , see how the all bench units played in the regular season played with a lot of ball movement. Its just really hard to implement when u have got 3 guys that revert to iso when all else fails. It pains to say its as much on Russ as anyone. He is not playing his game right now, lost his composure and is making stupid plays.

4) But even with flaws, Russ is not as bad as some here are calling. He is a great player, top 5 in league and Id take over anyone but Lebron and the Snake. He is a capable of so much better and he has shown it. He needs to calm down and play his game. He has not fully had a signature game yet this series, Melo can be at least a bit better, Adams has subpar.

"I know this is not the time to be preaching about how life can be wonderful if you put your mind to it, but thats not what i will try to do. I just want to say that personally i'm going to some tough times and thinking this way has helped me tremendously, even when i kind of hit rock bottom again tonight when we lost .

What i do however want to focus on is that **we are not yet eliminated from the playoffs**. I know that last nights game was a win or go home game mentally, as coming back from 3-1 is highly unlikely, but guess what?

We can still have a (small) chance to redeem ourselves.

In fact we still have home court advantage, and not just any but it's the fucking Peake! And any game from now will even more important than last night's. As any OKC fan knows, even the most steamrolling, great teams have lost a series when being up 3-1.

There are two scenario's really:

**1)** We straight up lose our next game (or later this series) and its going to suck. But guess what, even though Presti pulled this 'championship or nothing season' out of nothing, we weren't even supposed to be in this situation a year ago.

Paul George most likely leaves and we are stuck with terrible contracts of Russ and Melo, but at least we tried! How many times have stars just been suffering on mediocre teams without even being surrounded by the talent that OKC acquired this year?

Russ, Melo and Paul George could all have been in that boat, hadn't they been teamed up. Yes perhaps the experiment failed miserably, but at least they were given a chance, and we were given the chance to admire that on our team.

As strange as it may sound but there is more to basketball than winning championships. If it all goes south then we can finally prove as fans that we can support a team that is not been stacked with insane talent, ever since getting the team. 

Rebuilding will suck a lot but it's not the end of the world and could be the start of something beautiful. I won't be desillusional and pretend we're going to draft another Russ, Harden, KD and Ibaka. But to be completely honest, i enjoyed the season where the prospects were developing more than the 'championship or bust' seasons.

**2)** Next game we win at home and we go 3-2, at the very least that means we figured something out and gained momentum. From there it's still anyones series. As game 1 showed, all it takes is for one of the stars to go off. At the very least! Our talent on paper is still superior to that of Utah if you ask me. All it takes is for the team to get rolling and as far away as that might seem, this is the very last chance they get at doing so.

A referee isn't going to eject Billy Donovan from a playoff game in Utah. Especially with how much the refs were letting go already. He needs to be up there fighting for his team like his job depends on it.

"No pressure, just sat back and watched Westbrook dominate and make me happy. It didn’t matter that billy donovan sucked, because we didn’t have high expectations anyways. Now this just sucks because we look back and we’re so hyped up for the season and now that we’re underperforming it just sucks. I live in Massachusetts and I sat here on a school night to watch this game till 2AM hoping we’d pull this out, and I’m just disappointed


The ISO’s are just terrible. On the regular season, OKC is second in total ISOs on the season— but they’re 4th from last in FG% in ISOs. We recorded 10 assists (maybe nine can’t remember) which is laughably terrible. 


BD’s rotations are terrible. I’m sorry, but when this team was clicking for the solid month in dec. people came out and said that Billy Donovan wasn’t that bad of a coach and we were just reactionary. Well now what? Melo played 36 minutes just to have a terrible night on terrible efficiency and bricked wide open 3 after 3. I was debating on whether he’d even see 2 minutes in the 4th, then I look and he spends the entire quarter on the floor? He provides nothing

Now, Westbrook. I love this man and he’s made watching basketball so enjoyable for me but damn it he just got outplayed. I’m not gonna be reactionary and just say he’s an absolute cancer like I’ve seen other users say on this very sub, but he’s just not being controlled. He needs to be part of a motion offense and not an iso based offense. Like shit, Westbrook’s athleticism allows him to penetrate so fucking easily and it’d work so well in an off-ball movement based system rather than running iso sets after iso sets.


Personally I say we let PG walk, absorb Melos contract for this next season, release him and surround Westbrook with 3&D role players and a good coach who coaches discipline rather than ISO. Discipline comes first, because when talent fails to succeed there is nothing left for our team.

"Grades.... based on the stats here... http://www.espn.com/nba/team/stats/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder

PG13 B- shooting and defense not bad, but dissappears when we need him, a complaint carried over at times from Indiana.

Westbrook C- my favorite player but he is shooting 38% on twos and under 30% on 3s. If he wasnt bringing energy and effort it would be an F. Also 5.3 TOs is totally unacceptable.

Melo C His shooting actually isnt bad, but not in top form, and thats his strength at this point of his career. Now if you compare him to prime melo, he would get a D- but players age. Its just a fact of life, and not fair to expect that of him, but we should expect more than what we are getting.

More commentary on westbrook and melos shooting. Westbrooks adjusted fg% is 39%. Next lowest is melo at 49%. I think league average for afg% is around 53%. Everyone else on the team is above 50% with adams leading the way as usual (actually brewer and felton are slightly better, but all 3 combined take less shots than pg or wb individually.) Also whats killing us is the least efficient shooter is shooting the most at 20 shots per game, and our most efficient scorers are shooting among the least on a per minutes basis.

Also for points per shot, westbrook has a miserable 1.02 with melo 2nd worst at 1.12. PGs pps is just fine but he needs help from others.
1.2 pps is the absolute minimum you would expect from a star player on the perimeter, and an above average big guy, with many above 1.3, some above 1.4 (lebron, durant) and the best scorers around 1.5 (harden, curry.) Our 1st and 3rd option aren't getting it done. 1.02 pps is just horrible and 1.12 is not good.

Adams C- Too many fouls, not enough rebounds, not enough shots (but thats not ALL his fault.) atleast he keeps his composure, but we need him to challenge gobert for boards and stay in the game.

Brewer B- playing to about the expected level. Brings energy and effort. Unfirtunately he is not roberson, and though better on offense, he doesnt get much opportunity there with all of our chuckers. Makes me think roberson mght actually be better on offense on another team and that he just cant develop here being relayed to 5th option.

Billy Donovan F thoroughly being outcoached this series.

Bench C+ Grant is playing to about his experience. A little more seasoning and he would be better. I think he will get there with another team, since we wont be able to afford him. The bench is not deep or experienced other than Felton, and are not really making any kind if difference in this series, and we need them to, thus the C+. I would say that they are only playing slightly worse than expected though. 

And actually the one game we won at home was because of our bench play mostly, and paul george gets some credit there too. The starters overall have not been good as a unit in any of the 4 games.

I love sports because, regularly, impossibilities are rendered possible. Underdogs triumph, odds become obsolete, and heroes write their stories. 

We've all seen great performances in which teams and star players transcend circumstances to make magic happen. Let's believe in a little bit of magic right now. 

I implore all of us, as passionate fans of this team, to believe with certainty that we will win and to do our part by restricting our negativity while watching the rest of these playoffs. It can't hurt. 

And besides, why not?!

"Obviously last game was horrible, but from the ashes of that negativity I noticed something - the Thunder play like garbage with Adams out of the starting lineup. So the obvious answer is to keep him on the floor as long as possible to maximize effectiveness. But how do you go about doing this? If I'm Donovan, my lineup for game 4 will be Westbrook/George/Melo/Patterson/Adams, with George sliding back to his original position and Melo sliding back to his natural position. This allows the Thunder to match the Jazz size since they don't have the ability to play small effectively against Gobert. On defense I would task Patterson with containing Gobert to prevent Adams from reaching foul trouble. When the initial subs come in I would put in Grant for Patterson, and then when Adams goes to the bench put Patterson back in. 

This lineup has the ability to space the floor better; and prevents Melo from getting eaten alive by Favors and gives Adams an easier time on defense. 

This might not fix all the issues the Thunder have, but I feel this gives them the best chance of taking back the series.","How to matchup with the Jazz Obviously last game was horrible, but from the ashes of that negativity I noticed something - the Thunder play like garbage with Adams out of the starting lineup.

"I don't know about you guys, but from what I saw in the season, what makes Westbrook special is his penetrating ability.  He can score so easily down low.  And that penetration free's up Adams for pick and roll action (around 1/2 of Westbrook's assists were to adams).  

&nbsp;

Golbert (and the utah defense...but mostly Golbert) completely eradicate those advantages.  Westbrook can't drive and finish as he usually does.  Can't pass to Adams for a 5 footer or a dunk.  

&nbsp;

What does this leave the team with?  It leaves Westbrook shooting mid-range and 3's while also passing out to 3pt shooters only.  He can't pass inside.  *I'd say a good 35% of the offense has been taken away from OKC by Golbert and the Utah defense*.

&nbsp;

**So, what alternatives do you guys have to counteract the OKC lack of offense because of Golbert's influence over Russell?**  Melo and George aren't enough, but man, I feel like OKC just needs to push Melo/George as much as possible cause even if they shoot inefficiently, it'll be better than Westbrook's passes and shots being neutralized.

"Posted this in r/nba as well, thought I'd share here. 

What was the problem for the Thunder on offence imo? 

Terrible shot selection, no high % shots, very little paint points. Basically chucking mid-range jumpers up. Now if Russ has the option to drive or shoot, he will drive every time. But the lineups we put out had very tough floor spacing and we couldn’t punish them for packing the paint and [helping off our non shooters](https://imgur.com/a/0LmqXA3)  

So why don’t we put out a lineup that gives us floor spacing for the Adams and Westbrook PnR to work? Or Adams-George PnR so Gobert has to step up? Or I heard one of the [national tv](https://youtu.be/NJe_7L85RoE?t=481) shows they suggest to 'sit  Steve Adams down' play small and get Gobert out of the paint so Westbrook has a field day in the paint, or even play Westbrook as many minutes as you can when Gobert is on the bench. 

Again imo we just cannot play Adams and Grant together, or Brewer, Grant and Adams. We need shooters out there.

"I think last night was a weird game that came to a head with Adams fouling out and the big 3 going for 2 pts in the 4th.

"Against a good center like Gobert, when Adams is out or not 100% we get fucked in the ass. We have so many players that BD doesn't even play (Singler, Huestis, Hamilton, etc) and no backup center. It's fine to say ""oh we couldn't get one off the buyout, we'll groom Dakari to just be a defensive body"", but they didn't do that. Instead, Adams fouls out of a close game and we have absolutely *NO ONE* that can come in and even *attempt* to handle Gobert.

"I’ve watched the first playoff game three times and I’ve noticed the majority of the plays used that night were unused the majority of the season. The true spark between teammates was unreal. I’m starting to wonder if the thunder have been hiding their true potential so there was no film of their plays that are fool-proof. Maybe I’m hallucinating but I hadn’t seen those plays before all season.  

I don’t really focus on the media and how they portray the team because if it’s not Oklahoma announcers everyone talks mad shit on the thunder and Westbrook. 

Win/lose does Paul George stay in OKC? Does Melo stay after this season? I’ve seen melo playoff style and he can be a force to be reckoned with. Tonight I can almost promise that Paul George will be double and triple teamed tonight outside the arc and he will have to kickout to melo or Westbrook or abrines. I’m calling okc 117 and Utah 110 for the final score tonight. We will get behind 15 points in the third quarter but our bench will come out and unfuck everything.

Am I crazy or am I onto something with the plays being new and unused? I feel like they didn’t want film of the plays that work really well. 

Does PG and Melo stay after this season? Does Enes come back? I’m really thinking that I can bet a dead hooker on Steven Adams making a three attempt in this series from the left wing.

I hope this doesn’t get me in trouble on this thread. I hope the thunder come out in a rage tonight and beat that ass.  THUNDER UP!!","Has OKC been hiding its true potential?

I need some help/advice from the /r/nba community. I've spoken about this before to a couple of people and I've received a good reception, but I've done nothing about it. I want to write a book about Russell Westbrook.

I don't really know how to frame the story or what I want I want to say explicitly about him. What I do know is that I find him fascinating. I find his energy and the way he carries himself, on and off the court, beyond unique. He makes me feel like anything is possible. Watching him play basketball makes me think superhumans exist.

What I'd like, if it's available, is advice on how I can frame a novel length book around him. I thought it might be interesting to talk about ""the most statistically brilliant season ever"" but with this season over it kind of feels like a moot angle to pursue. But I still feel this urge to just talk about how amazing he is as an athlete and a human.

I'd really love if people would be able to give me some guidance on what they think is a good way to frame Russell's work in a way that I can present cogently to an audience that might not quite grasp just how special he is.

Sorry if this is boring or trite, I don't know, I love Russell Westbrook and to be honest so should you. That's what I want to achieve, that he's really worth understanding as a human.","The Russell Westbook (this was deleted twice by the mods on /r/nba so I took it here)

"I think we're just going to have to continue to deal with the fact that this team likes to try to keep some things in their back pocket for the playoffs. I don't know why it ends up in losses in the regular season but Billy really coached a good one last night.

The only knock I had was bringing in Ferg second off the bench and he fixed that in the second half and 2Pat get those minutes. 

BD had one of the big 3 on the floor at all times. He even threw out you alls fave lineup with bench + Melo. When Grant was on the floor is when I felt like we really went on that run. We were able to either pull Gobert out or we played really nice pick and roll.

I also still think the PnR with Adams is maybe being saved until we *absolutely* need it. I think Utah was expecting it and it just didn't happen which opened up plays for Paul/Melo/Abrines. I guess we'll see moving forward but I shit on Billy A TON and it's only right to give props.

I'm nervous for game 2 -- I think it will be a lot closer but I'm way more confident that we'll make the right adjustment and continue winning.","We have to give BD his props I think we're just going to have to continue to deal with the fact that this team likes to try to keep some things in their back pocket for the playoffs.

I’ve been to almost every playoff game the thunder have played. The atmosphere tonight was solid - not WCF against the spurs but solidly in playoff mode. The fans were in it from tip to finish and booed the hell out of the offensive foul call on Russ for the next 5min.

I’m not sure what game the idiots on the radio were watching but with Rudy in the paint we have to change play style. It’s not a hard concept to understand.

Thunder by 20+, wire to wire victory. Russ triple double, and PG scores 30+. People in the post game thread will question whether the Jazz can even take a game from us.

"‘Twas the night before playoffs, when all through the league, 

not a creature was stirring, not even Jeff Teague.

The Rockets fans were nestled all snug in their beds,

While visions of free throws danced in their heads.

The Spurs fans checked the injury report with care,

In hopes that Kawhi Leonard soon would be there.

And AD with his brow, he just lit some candles,

And tried not to worry about Damien’s handles.

And before he tucked in, Russell left out some cookies

Before beating the ass of the league’s second best rookie.

When out on the lawn arose such a clatter,

John Wall sprang from his bed – “oh no, it’s the Raptors!”

Ty Lue slept mostly with the help of medication,

Praying playoff LeBron kept him from an early vacation.

Ben Simmons turned off Fortnite, and went early to sleep,

Not worried at all by Coach Spo and the Heat.

All of the Celtics, from various hospital beds,

Trusted Brad Stevens with his squad full of kids.

Just a few Pacers fans would wake with a scream,

Wishing that they still had ol’ PG13.

They heard Adam Silver exclaim, from just out of sight – 

“Happy playoffs to all, and to all a good night!”

"I don't care who he knocks out.

Dame's numbers are pretty much the same as last year's and he's done nothing particularly noteable.

Steph is Steph but he's played like 50 games.

CP3 also has very similar stats to last year, while playing less than 60 games. Houston is awesome but I could argue the improvement of their bench is what helped the Rockets more than CP3.

I don't even know who else is in it, but Russ is a guy who keeps doing historical shit. He doesn't whine and complain about the honors. And even after what looked like a lost season, he turned up and helped lead us to a 4 seed. Did I mention he averaged a triple double again?

I know other guys are killing it but it bothers how much lack of recognition Russ gets.","I gotta be honest, I think Russ at least deserves All-NBA first team I don't care who he knocks out.

Dame's numbers are pretty much the same as last year's and he's done nothing particularly noteable.

"Now that a lot of dust has settled, I went ahead and put together a spreadsheet of possible Western Conference playoff scenarios while altering the results of 4 games: GSW/UTA, DEN/MIN, SAS/NOP, and UTA/POR. (Yes, this assumes we beat Memphis to cut down on scenarios.) I'd seen a lot of posts on r/nba showing our possible seeding, but nothing on matchups. TL;DR - get ready for Utah.

Through changing those results, our possible seeding is anywhere from 4-6. Because playoff teams are playing each other, so long as we hit 48 wins, there will always be at least 2 teams below us in the playoffs.

Our matchup odds for different teams are as follows: Utah - 77%, San Antonio - 6%, Portland - 9%, New Orleans - 8%. These odds come from the odds these teams win those respective 4 games.

But Utah has the most games left - why are our odds of hitting them so high? This is a quirk in the tiebreaker system - based on the teams who break ties over each other, we have ~45% chance of meeting Utah in the 4/5 matchup with homecourt advantage AND ~30% chance of meeting Utah in the 3/6 matchup WITHOUT homecourt advantage. (We only ever play San Antonio and New Orleans in the 4/5 matchup without homecourt, and we only ever play Portland in the 3/6 matchup without homecourt. We can only get homecourt against Utah.)

Now, a lot of this boils down to our own tiebreakers. We kind of shot ourselves in the foot by losing a lot of the tiebreakers with other relevant teams. Our division win % is terrible, our conference win % isn't great, and we lose head to head pretty often. Our ace in the hole is... Utah. Any time a 3 way tiebreaker pops up, we're last every time, unless Utah is also involved. The 3 way ties almost always happen in the 4/5/6 seed, so when Utah isn't part of that tie, we just lose down to the 6. (And play Portland or Utah.) But when Utah is involved, we shoot up to the 4, while Utah slides right into the 5 since they own tiebreakers with so many other teams.

Anyway, if you have a rooting interest, here's the general trend:

We play Portland as the 6 seed if and only if we end up in a 4 way tie involving them, us, Utah, and some other team. Usually this is because Utah loses to Golden State then beats Portland.

We play San Antonio as the 5 seed if Utah **and** New Orleans go winless from here on out.

Russ ended up with 23-18-10 statline this game. That's 2 rebounds shy from getting 20 rebounds which I predicted in the said link.

I'm a huge Thunder fan but let's not deny the fact that Russ wants to chase that triple double stat again this season. You see how focused he was on getting the rebounds which is actually not a bad thing. I'm not mocking him or anything which I think most of you believed I was implying in that comment.

I am hoping he'll get that 16 rebounds against Memphis next game. He'll definitely go for it and I think everyone should acknowledge this.

"So I just wanted to pop by to wish you all luck in the last couple games since the Knicks just make me sad now.

Westbrook is my second favorite player in the league (behind KP) and I’ve always loved the Thunder and their arena. You guys give me an actual reason to watch the playoffs this year and actively root for a team. 

Also, I’ve watched the last 24 or so Thunder games (since KP went down) and I want to let you know that Melo will more than likely turn it on in the playoffs. He’s much older now but he knows he can’t play playoff level every game. I think y’all saw it in the HOUSTON game when it’s a must-win scenario. I truly think he’ll come out and surprise you.

Anyway, thanks for giving me a team to cheer for if you’ll have me! I’m always down to drop some Amelo’s in the game threads.","Knicks fan here with nothing but good vibes for you guys So I just wanted to pop by to wish you all luck in the last couple games since the Knicks just make me sad now.

"The Rockets game was a watershed moment for Russ. This was the game he made a true believer out of me. Until now, I have loved Russ but always questioned whether he had the decision making ability to take a team to the very top. 

This game was incredible from Russ. His decision making was spot on. He utilised his drive to the rim game but sprinkled it with kick outs to PG and Melo perfectly. 

The Rockets were packing the paint and stopping the pick and roll, which usually works against the Thunder. To see him adjust so well on the fly and not get frustrated showed me that he continues to mature and add the needed variation to his game.  It finally looked like we were playing chess not checkers. 

The result was a plethora of good looks which we nailed.  That extra split second for the shooters to get set and lock in on the hoop. This was due to the defence not knowing where we were going to strike next.  

The defence was awesome as well, but I always knew Russ had that when he was locked in. 

Russ finally showed me what a true point guard looks like. Add to his outrageous athleticism and I am amped to see him lead OKC going forward. 

Ps: point god Russ is needed to attract free agents as well

Now I want to talk about PG, and the very recent, but prevalent,
opinion on this subreddit that he has checked out. Apparently, it’s clear as day that he’s done with the Thunder. But why? Why would PG, who knows he has been underperforming himself, want to be done with this team? He knows what the team is capable of. He was there for the Warriors blowouts and the Rockets game on Christmas Day. He knows that despite the team’s record, they have a shot at going all the way. Why would he have checked out?

Is it possible that maybe his own slump affected his demeanor more than his current opinion on the team?

There’s this narrative that he is done with OKC because he’s been playing poorly, but I think it’s much more likely that he’s very frustrated with himself and that is affecting “effort” and confidence more than anything else.

"I first started watching nba the year OKC was formed after the move from Seattle, and the timing seemed too perfect not be a fan of the new up and coming organization with the 2nd pick of the draft. That being said. I am still not 100% sure how to pronounce Andre Roberson's name.

I have heard so many people pronounce it both ways, and I am of the opinion that it is pronounced: Robber Sin because that's how our announcers pronounce it. I have been using this pronunciation ever since. But it makes more sense if it is pronounced: Row Bur Sin because this is the normal way used to pronounce Roberson, and this is typically the pronunciation I see most used in the media.

Which one is correct? Robber Sin or Row Bur Sin?

Presti and George's people get together and execute a sign and trade with LA.

This is a different situation than the one that the Pacers found themselves in. They knew George wasn't re-signing. LA was comfortable waiting it out.

1 year later the Thunder hold the cards here. LA can wait it out again, but if George wants to he can always sign a 2 year contract with an ETO to see out the WB-Melo-George big 3 experiment. 

So how does LA get George this summer? They trade away Deng, Kuzma, and a 2019 1st rd pick. 

The trade benefits LA because they get George and drop Deng. Sure, they lose Kuzma, but they still have Ingram. They part ways with a 1st rd pick, but realistically how good would the pick actually be if PG was on the team? Would it even be a lottery pick?

Thunder would have to absorb Deng's contract, but get promising prospect in Kuzma. 

Is this better than just letting George walk? 

If anyone has any other contingency plans let's see em.","""Paul George is leaving OKC"" Contingency Plans I hope PG stays.

But if he decides he doesn't want to stay and wants to go to LA, what does Presti have up his sleeve?

"The thunder have all the pieces to legitimately give the warriors fits, I think this team is certainly the biggest threat to GS at least conceptually. The defense is as good as any team in the NBA that’s not the problem, the problem is that the offense is horrible there is no cutting, no motion offense to get shooters open, no real offensive system to generate easy shots for everyone. Russ barely moves without the ball, he passes it and hangs back which allows his man to sag off him and shadow the ball handler, if he was in constant motion by either screening or cutting or setting cross screens to get him a mismatch then the thunder offense would be much more deadly. Russ can score we all know that but as the leader of this team he has to use his gravity in order to generate easier shots for everyone else. Same goes for PG13, who when locked in is probably a top 10 player. If you watch the warriors offense you will see their stars in constant motion, which makes it very exhausting and difficult for even great defenses to guard not only does this allow them to get open but it sucks in the defense which creates easy shots for role players. 

No matter how well you guard the warriors, if you’re offense is plagued with stagnation you will not beat them. They are a great defensive team and you only make things easier for them when you attack in isolation, you have to put them in situations where their decision making on defense has to be spot on, you have to confuse them. Again I don’t know what’s wrong with the thunder offense but I know it’s been this way for a while even in 2016 it was like this, I really don’t know why","Need more movement The thunder have all the pieces to legitimately give the warriors fits, I think this team is certainly the biggest threat to GS at least conceptually.

"First off, I know we're not in the best place to be talking about what seed we want, but I'm going to anyways.


At this point of this season, realistically speaking, we are probably not going to win the championship. If we had Dre, it'd be a whole other conversation but we don't. Therefore, I think the goal of this season is performing well enough to make a case for Paul George to stay. That's why we need the 7th seed because it gives us the best chance of making it to the WCF thus making the strongest argument for Paul George to stay.


First off, let's be honest here. We aren't going to beat Houston in a bo7 especially considering they have the home game advantage. So avoiding Houston for as long as possible is the name of the game. Therefore, 8th seed is obviously the worst option, but I'd even argue that the 4th seed is the second worst option in the long run. This would lead to us playing Houston in the second round, and a second round exit is not enough to convince George to stay. At the very least, it's not a strong argument to stay.


For the exact same reasoning, we do not want the 5th seed as it'd mean playing a GSW team that has Steph Curry in a bo7. This would most likely result in a second round exit which again is most likely not enough to get Paul George to stay. We need to make it to the WCF.


If we were to get the 7th seed, it'd mean playing a Curryless GSW, and I honestly think we have a decent chance at winning this match up. If either George or Melo played decently, that game probably would have been a stomp. 


If we beat the GSW, that'd mean we'd play either Portland or whoever ends up being the 6th seed. This is obviously easier than playing a full GSW or Houston team, and the easiest way to make a strong case for Paul George to stay.


With all of that being said, I just hope we make it to playoffs.

"I think it's okay to admit that this year has been somewhat of a disappointment. We'll probably have the same record as last year while feeling like we are a worse team, but I'm wondering if we should keep things in perspective here.

**The loss of Dre was huge**

In December we went 12-5. We were a combined 22-9 in December and January when it seemed we hit our stride. That's a 70% win percentage. That's like winning 57-58 games over a season. When our starting unit played together we were something like 16-1. Dre had the highest +/- on/off court. Adams and Westbrook are behind him (could be a matter of sample size but still).

We *had* it figured out. Dre's defense and his ability to cut were extremely important. If Dre comes back better than 80%, don't you think we could win 10 more games next year at the very least?

**The addition of Corey Brewer could be big**

Corey ain't Dre but I do think having him in the starting line-up has not been all that bad. Since getting here he's given us 10ppg/3.5r/1.4 assists while shooting 35% from 3 and 80% from the FT line in 28 minutes. He is solid. He is active. And he could be a lovely bench player to spell Andre next season.

He knows his role and plays in it very well, in my opinion. He is not at all washed and he is fasstttt. He's got a lot more basketball in him and I think we should be excited to have these lengthy defenders on our team.

***Where else is Jerami going to go?***

Jerami Grant deserves to get fucking paid. He's been a dog on defense and a MAN on offense. He's hitting FTs and 3s in the 2nd part of this season and man...we are all sad that JG is probably on his way out of here next season.

But is he? What teams have money? The bottom of the barrel teams. Many other contenders are in our position with not having a ton of money available and with PG/LeBron being FAs and with people trying to trade for Kawhi, I can't imagine Jerami is going to be at the top of a lot of contender's lists.

A lot of orgs overspent maxing guys like Otto Porter and paying guys like Kent Bazemore hella money. No one wants to do that again. Grant makes less than $2ms this year. You don't think he'd take the MLE from OKC if we offered it? I bet he would...

**We simply aren't making shots**

In the game threads I'm always so confused when you guys are complaining about lack of ball movement and bad defense and stuff like that. We're #11 in offense and defense rating while having the 8th best net rating. We're somewhere between a top 10 team this season, even with all our hiccups. 

[Jon Hamm seemed to confirm by suspicions with his stats.](https://twitter.com/JonMHamm/status/981649390933864448) In the past 7 games, we're passing **TWO MORE** potential assists (the ball *is* moving) per game while converting on **TWO LESS** potential assists per game. We've been losing by a possession here and possession there. We aren't getting blown out. Our guys just can't seem to make shots. 

My guess is the exertion of energy on the defensive end. We switch everything and now we're starting to fight over screens on guards (which is good) so that Steve isn't out there guarding quick, short dudes. But I'm sure that shit is tiring, idc if you're Roberson or Carmelo. It requires a TON of energy to run through screens set by big ass dudes to catch up with a quick ass dude. TOUGH.

PG says his shot mechanics aren't right. Melo actually hasn't been all bad since ASB and Russ is gonna Russ no matter what. 

I know this year has been wack and I've said it and I've seen people say we need to just let PG walk, but the more I think about it, the more I think everyone should give it one more try. I was proponent of PG giving us a 1+1 deal and I still think he could/should. Melo probably won't opt out so if we're going to be in the tax, we should at least do it while competitng. Plus, there's not a ton of other guys that will be on the market that we'd want other than like Marcus Smart.

TL;DR: we've had a lot of things working against us but we're still a top team in the NBA this year. With Dre coming back and better rotations for next year probably, we'd have a much better season. Shouldn't we try to aim for that?","Should we not give up on our bigger picture? I think it's okay to admit that this year has been somewhat of a disappointment.

A lot of orgs overspent maxing guys like Otto Porter and paying guys like Kent Bazemore hella money. No one wants to do that again. Grant makes less than $2ms this year. You don't think he'd take the MLE from OKC if we offered it? I bet he would...

**We simply aren't making shots**

In the game threads I'm always so confused when you guys are complaining about lack of ball movement and bad defense and stuff like that. We're #11 in offense and defense rating while having the 8th best net rating. We're somewhere between a top 10 team this season, even with all our hiccups. 

[Jon Hamm seemed to confirm by suspicions with his stats.](https://twitter.com/JonMHamm/status/981649390933864448) In the past 7 games, we're passing **TWO MORE** potential assists (the ball *is* moving) per game while converting on **TWO LESS** potential assists per game. We've been losing by a possession here and possession there. We aren't getting blown out. Our guys just can't seem to make shots. 

My guess is the exertion of energy on the defensive end. We switch everything and now we're starting to fight over screens on guards (which is good) so that Steve isn't out there guarding quick, short dudes. But I'm sure that shit is tiring, idc if you're Roberson or Carmelo. It requires a TON of energy to run through screens set by big ass dudes to catch up with a quick ass dude. TOUGH.

PG says his shot mechanics aren't right. Melo actually hasn't been all bad since ASB and Russ is gonna Russ no matter what. 

I know this year has been wack and I've said it and I've seen people say we need to just let PG walk, but the more I think about it, the more I think everyone should give it one more try. I was proponent of PG giving us a 1+1 deal and I still think he could/should. Melo probably won't opt out so if we're going to be in the tax, we should at least do it while competitng. Plus, there's not a ton of other guys that will be on the market that we'd want other than like Marcus Smart.

TL;DR: we've had a lot of things working against us but we're still a top team in the NBA this year. With Dre coming back and better rotations for next year probably, we'd have a much better season. Shouldn't we try to aim for that?",16,11,Should we not give up on our bigger picture?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/8a0aot/should_we_not_give_up_on_our_bigger_picture/

"Good evening Thunder fans,

Let me start by saying some of you guys have become literally insufferable. I think its a combination of a lack of quality content, some new fans who don't seem to understand the ebb and flow of the NBA and a lackluster year after such high expectations have led to many of our long term readers being driven away and replaced with what we have today.

Now I try to stay completely unbiased and delete as little as possible to allow you guys to create the content you really want on the sub, leaving you in charge of upvoting and downvoting what you think is necessary. For a while we were getting by on just banning the trolls that occasionally drifted in from other parts of Reddit, but we are about to shift our focus inwards towards our own community.

  

* Spammers.

Now listen, I don't want to shit on your dreams of starting a podcast, blog or YouTube channel. However, if you're simply using Reddit and Twitter to spam links to your 3rd party content we are going to ban you and blacklist your site. If you're active on this community and posting other content or commenting frequently things that are not related to your 3rd party site then we are all for you boosting exposure to your projects every now and then within reason. This will be judged on a case by case basis so don't be surprised when this rule is suddenly strictly enforced.



* Negativity.

Here's the one I'm not looking forward to. Telling overly emotional and pissed off people to chill out tends to not be very easy. However here are a few general concepts for how we are going to enforce this one. 

Having an opinion is fine. 
Do you think Billy Donovan is a terrible coach? That's your prerogative, feel free to express that opinion whenever its on topic and civil. If you think this opinion is worth sharing in a post, please go into detail about why, give examples of poor coaching decisions and share who you think might be a good replacement. **DO NOT** post some single sentence brain neutral post that adds nothing to the conversation other then letting us know where you stand on the issue. These posts will be removed at the mods discretion.

Being negative is fine.
If you're angry post-game, feel free to vent in the post-game thread. Call out all the shitty plays that happened, all the terrible decisions made by any player all the feelings you have about that guys contract or this guys potential or lack there of. **However** if all you do is bitch about everything that happens day in and day out, we are going to ban you. This isn't because we are power hungry basement dwelling neckbeards, its because hardly anyone enjoys that and we have been overwhelmed with requests to cut down on it. We will slowly implement this rule so as not to shock anyone. You will start with a 1 day ban and a warning, a note will be added to your name via mod tools then next time you're gone. We don't have time to keep tabs on thousands of you so if this seems harsh, we are sorry.


* Relevant posts.

Please keep simple concepts posts in the pre-game, game and post-game threads. If Kyle Singler posterizes Lebron James and everyone is hyped up and you want to say simply SINGLER IS THE FUCKING GOAT, then please for the love of God just post that in the game thread rather than making a post that says  only that. If you have a streamable of the dunk, feel free to post it as a stand alone post. If someone wants to make a Singer dunks on Lebron upvote party, go right ahead even though that's somewhat tacky. If 17 people post upvote parties after anyone does anything we are going to delete everything but the first post.


In summary we are just going to be more strict with crap content in an attempt to make the sub more enjoyable. Please feel free to discuss these changes in this thread.

Thank you for your time,

"Hi fellow Thunder fans, I wanted to post my Playoffs tracker for several reasons:

1. To make sure I didn't make any incorrect assumptions/calculations/etc
2. To see if you have different thoughts on my projections for the remaining games
3. To show you where I project Thunder ending up in the Playoffs (which is 8th seed vs the Rockets)

This is an Excel file which I am uploading via Zippyshare (I have a personal phobia/avoidance of Google Docs, its very clunky to me)

https://www108.zippyshare.com/v/A3IwQjUR/file.html

What I've done is listed all the remaining WC games by day and entered my projections for who will win/lose.  This was done relatively quickly just based on their prior games this year, looking at who has B2B games, home court advantage etc etc.  Let me know if you think anything will fall differently! Then I have actualized the file for yesterday's games and will continue to do so throughout the remainder of the season.

For the Thunder, I had us winning last night :( and for the remaining three games I have L vs Rockets, L vs Heat, W vs Grizzlies.  For all the other still relevant west conference teams, of course there are a ton of remaining games so you can check those out on your own.

With these results, I have us projected at 8th seed -- a tie with the Pelicans which they have the tiebreaker (note that the ranking in cells AA14:AC23 do not know how to take into account tiebreaker ranking so that has to be done manually in your head -- I could probably build that in for next time, would need to list out the whole season's games)

If we take a W vs the Heat, that bumps us up to a three-way tie with Wolves and Spurs, ceteris paribus.  I have determined that the tiebreakers in that case would have us in the 7th seed since we have the worst record of those three teams in games amongst the three (them both 4-3, us 3-5).  Fun fact all those games were won by the home team except for one, which I believe was that ridiculous double no-call Andrew Wiggins hero chuck game (not that I'm bitter or anything).  

Anyway, I just wanted to show my file to some fellow fans to see what they think about the upcoming games.  I think we will end up in 7th - 8th seed, let's just pray for a big W vs the Heat to boost us into that 7th seed, and then Russ to go super sayan against the Curry-less Warriors!

I would love to know if you have any different predictions for the remaining games (not just Thunder but all of them!  Since it all matters)

Please let me know if I made any mistakes as well and I will amend the file.



Also FWIW, 538 gives us a 93% chance of making the playoffs.  We got this!

"Grew up in upstate NY. As such I was a Syracuse fan. Melo has led us to '03 title. Westy is my favorite player to watch in the NBA. As such I have been rooting as much as I can for OKC. Will always love Melo, and I may be biased but I will try to be as unbiased as possible here. I want Thunder fans' opinions on this. I haven't been able to watch much of OKCs games this year, but with work lightening up I have been able to watch the last couple Thunder games. 

Simple question, is Billy Donovan misusing Melo? Melo certainly doesn't help his own case with lack of hustle, poor defense, and lack of movement without the ball. Shit, its sad, because of Melo just moved without the ball, Westy would find him. LeBron gets 5-6 easy lay-ups and dunks a game just from making sharp cuts.


Either way, watching the last couple games, it seems Melo is nothing more than a 3 point shooter on this team. Let me be the first to tell you, Melo can certainly shoot the 3, but he's streaky. If he's cold, he needs to get some easy shots to find his rhythm but he does not get that in OKC. Next thing you know he finishes the game 1-8 or 0-6 from 3 and OKC fans just hate him, and its understandable.


Personally, I believe Melo is the most skilled offensive player on OKC, even at this age. Westy is OKC's best player, but Melo can still be extremely valuable on offense. Why am I not seeing a 1/3 Pick and Roll between Westy and Melo? Melo has a great post game, and if you could get Westy to switch Melo onto a smaller guard and post him up, Melo would absolutely abuse them. The problem is on both on Melo and the coaching. I believe Melo has become even more of a ball stopper than ever before, and now whenever he touches the ball he feels the need to shoot it simply because he's never gotten the ball this little in his career and his thought process is simply ""I need to shoot because idk when I will get the ball again"".


Kind of like Cleveland does with Kevin Love, I believe Melo should get some iso post up touches. Just give him the ball and let him go to work. I believe a Melo/Westy pick and roll could be potentially devastating on smaller guards. If Melo was given these opportunities, I believe there is a better chance he could find his rhythm and be valuable even on an off-shooting night from deep. 


Watching today's game was painful. OKC just does not move without the ball and its sad. Adams and Jerami Grant get tons of easy baskets from RWB due to movement. PG and Melo both stand and spectate. 

Highlights of Melo's post game:

"I know this is asking a lot, but If Russ can play close to tonight’s level of efficiency, and players around him making shots, we will be alright. PG and Melo can’t have shooting %’s in the 20s for 7 games surely... if just even one of them goes off or makes about half the shots they missed we more than likely win these kinda games. I know that’s asking a lot but that’s what we’ll need. I saw a post on here about PG not passing to Abrines, but a lot of his play is quite selfish.

We do seem to take an absurd amount of lazy 3’s, Russ is a big culprit in this regard.

"Last year a bunch of math majors who became NBA media said Westbrook putting up triple doubles was not a big deal. That double digits is so arbitrary. Ok. Fine.

Now those SAME math majors are making a big ass deal about Lebron scoring 10 points in 800+ games in a row. Double digit. Arbitrary.

And funniest thing is scoring 10 points is the easiest thing to do for a triple double when you are the primary scorer.  So scoring 10 points is a big deal, yet averaging a triple double in a season is arbitrary and not that special. LOL.

Could these math major clowns being more butt hurt?  Just because Westbrook embarrased them in a post game interview 3 years ago they still hold a grudge against him.

Another thing about the 10 point record. Who cares?  Scoring 10 points is not a big deal at all. Even scrubs can score 10 points. So then these math majors say its a measure of amazing longevity and being an iron man. Fine.  But it ain't.

The true measure of being an Iron Man is the consecutive streak of playing without missing a game.  Last year Lebron missed 8 games. Year before it was 6, before that was 13.   In fact Lebron has never played a full season without missing a game. 

So if Lebron didn't feel well?  Just sit out the game. The 10 point streak continues.

Much more impressive than the 800+ 10 point streak is AC Green's 1192 games in a row without missing a game. That is more than 14 years.  Lebron does not even have a single year not missing a game.  Jordan had 8 years playing all 82 games.

"Starting a discussion (hopefully) about first round matchups, assuming we make the playoffs which i think we will. Let's look first at who we have a chance at playing which is basically anyone, and then discuss who we would rather have in the first round.

The standings as of today:

1. Rockets
2. Warriors
3. Trail Blazers
4. Spurs
5. Thunder
6. Jazz
7. Timberwolves
8. Pelicans

As it stands today, we would play the Spurs in the first round, which I don't think would be too bad for us. I highly doubt Leonard comes back just to play in the playoffs against a historical Rockets team and the incumbent Warriors. The Spurs names we're used to are all faded and coming off the bench. However, LMA is on a tear that should not be discounted.

When we look at the remaining games against GSW, HOU, MIA, and MEM its seems unlikely that we will climb the ranks any further, however the race is close enough that we could theoretically choose our matchup when the time comes. Dropping a single slot would put us up against a hungry Portland with CJ ""the thunder eater' McCollum. I like this matchup less than I do the one against the spurs but still am not too terribly frightened. Dame has to be respected- and certainly we need to keep a lid on CJ- but i think that in a 7 game series we are less likely to get torched by him more than once.

Dropping two places and we get the warriors. To be honest this is the most interesting match. On the one hand you have the knee jerk reaction to RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN. And there's a lot of merit to that though. The championship team is basically unchanged with big names from front to back. They can and will put you in the ground if you take them lightly. One only needs to go back a couple years to reopen that old wound. Klay can black out and beat you without even seeming to try. Not to mention KD. But on the other hand is my faith in my team. I think that while we have fallen off a little bit since the allstar break I think that our fire is there and just waiting for the right moment to burst. Losing Andre was a huge blow to our playoff aspirations but i think we got a decent hole filler in Brewer. This is a matchup that i think we could lose, but one that if we did win would give us huge momentum and confidence while also taking the piss out of the warriors which i know is something we would all enjoy.

The last is the Rockets. All that stuff i said about knee jerk reactions applies here. RUN AWAY. This is the team i want no part of in the first round. Harden is unstoppable. Yes, he does disappear in the playoffs sometimes but i dont think that happens this year. I believe the Rockets have their hearts set on the championship and they have a really good chance of getting it imo. I would rather face them in a  later round after they've been beat up by the pelicans or jazz, and even then I'm not too sure. 

When we began the season our goal was basically to do well enough to persuade PG to stay a little longer and give it another shot. That is pretty much a WCF appearence or bust. I believe we can do that, but we will have to beat the Rockets or Warriors to do so. What do you guys think?","Who do we want in round 1?

"So in an interview Melo expained why he got a technical foul while he was on the bench. “I was talking to [referee] Bill [Spooner] about jump shots,” Anthony said. “We were coming down. I think Paul [George] shot a couple. He was coming down and the guy was underneath him. I was like ‘Bill, you’ve got to call that, or somebody’s going to get hurt out here,’ and he said ‘I’ve got the whistle, you don’t. Let me ref.’ 

“So, right after that Paul got the drive and got fouled and he didn’t call it. I said ‘Bill, that’s a foul right there. Blow your whistle then.’ Then he gave me a tech.”

It's kinda ridiculous how the refs are with us (and to be honest after watching some other games I noticed that they're terrible with other teams as well), now I'm not saying that we're losing because of them even though that has happened before as well (Timberwolves and Bucks at home come to mind) but I think that the league should do something especially with the Playoffs around the corner. When our shots aren't falling we want the players driving to the basket to score, something that isn't easy when they're getting hammered and the officials swallow their whistles. It's a shame that many games come down to officiating and not the game of basketball, I'm hoping that the NBA finds a way to deal with that issue in the Playoffs .","Regarding Anthony's tech against the Pelicans.

"i'm not sure why you guys want OKC winning these close games.

If we win, then Billy Donovan doesn't make any changes. And if he doesn't make any changes, we will probably get swept in the 1st round.

He's still making big mistakes:
1. Ferguson is first man off bench. He continues to play him, and it has hurt the team.

2. He sticks with lineup of Felton-Ferg-George-Grant-Patterson. No one rebounds in this lineup. Ferg George and Patterson are negative rebounders compared to replacement. Grant and Felton are decent, but they are under sized.

3. He goes with all-bench lineup with Ferg. One of the worst lineups in NBA.

4. He finally decided to go with hot hand and let Jerami Grant play. you saw how he backtracked on his words that Melo will always play. That's because we lost to the Spurs and he decided to make a change. Just watch the post game interview against Portland. Jerami was +17 and was benched the last 6 minutes. 
There is no way Billy would have played Jerami all of 4th quarter yesterday if we didn't lose to the Spurs the day before.


All I'm saying is this. I rather lose games if Billy continues to make bone-headed coaching decisions. My main problem with winning is that we don't make any changes.

Our free throws are crap too. They need to figure out who is going to take clutch free throws.","It's good to lose now to force Donovan to make changes.. His rotations with Ferg and George's PT are absurd. He needs to fix it now before the playoffs. FTs are atrocious, and we don't know who takes clutch ones.

"PG's mind is obviously in LA. The dude said ""I play better in warmer weather"" the other day. He teases LA fans with little snippets. He gone. I don't even think we should make him an offer next season unless his attitude changes. The drama over his decision has been overwhelming, and to be honest he hasn't played like a max contract player this season. Let's move on. 

Adams is developing into a monster. Russ is already a beast. We should keep Grant instead and develop T Ferg into a 3&D monster and develop Abrines into a spot up shooter(by actually giving him the minutes to get into a groove). We'll still have Melo, and he needs to come off the bench. Donovan is gone next season(I think). It would be idiotic to keep BD. He's too mild mannered and won't get on Russ when he's making poor decisions. 

Anyways, this isn't a shitpost, I swear I'm not retarded. I just really think we could make a better team without Paul George. I'd say without Melo too, but we're stuck with him. I wish we had just kept Dipo, Sabonis, Kanter, and McNuggies. If Dipo had trained like he did and still played for us I honestly feel like we'd be at 50+ wins right now. Not the way it worked out though. Whats done is done. I think we need to cut our losses and build shooters/defenders around Russ and Adams. If you disagree let's discuss it. I know it's not popular to say 'just let PG go', but that's how I've felt since all this drama started.","Build the team around Russ/Adams. Don't make PG an offer in the off-season.

"i think one reason why we are underperforming is because the OK3 just isn't working as seamlessly as we'd like it to be. Russ wants to set his guy up for the perfect shot and he wants that guy to shoot.

when melo is on the floor, we get mad at him because the ball sticks. he wants to try to go one-on-one and we want him to catch and shoot.

i feel like paul does the same. so many times i feel like in the last 2 games, he's overplaying. he gets a wide open shot but choose to put the ball on the floor and try to create on top of a created play. just shoot the simple shot.

this is why it hink russ and the bench work so well together. abrines/grant/pat dont desire to put the ball on the floor and create. they will quickly take a shot. that kinda rhythm matters. last year's team was effective because they moved up and down the court at a ridiculosu pace. now we just dribble dribble dribble.

paul is great defensively but idk if it's this slump or not, but it seems like he's been trying to do way too much with the ball and he just needs to play the simple way.","we talk alot about melo not fitting into his role, but is PG? i think one reason why we are underperforming is because the OK3 just isn't working as seamlessly as we'd like it to be.

"I rewatched the game this morning, and from the 2nd quarter on the Spurs interior is a brick wall. Adams couldn't get going. Russ got smacked any time he tried to drive in. We didn't adjust at all. We kept running the same offensive sets over and over and it was clear that it wasn't working. Honestly, we can't blame this one on WB's airball. It was bad, yeah, but we shouldn't have been in that position to begin with. The Spurs are bigger than us, and we should've had Grant and Dakari in the lineup if just for defensive presence. I'm not so much angry at our players as I am at Donovan. His lack of in game adjustment competence is just legendary at this point. Go back and watch the game again. I swear we never try anything different. 

Hopefully we whoop the Nuggets tonight. If it hasn't happened already, I think Presti needs to sit BD down and talk to him about this. I know I'm armchair coaching here, but I just feel like there were so many things that could have been done differently coaching wise. He's gotta have the balls to take some players out in favor of the ones playing better.","Why didn't we adjust to the Spurs crowding the paint last night?

I swear we never try anything different. 

Hopefully we whoop the Nuggets tonight. If it hasn't happened already, I think Presti needs to sit BD down and talk to him about this. I know I'm armchair coaching here, but I just feel like there were so many things that could have been done differently coaching wise.

"I believe BD is a good coach in his own regard, but he cannot coach this team. We should be way better than we are. 

Reasons:

-Terrible play caller
-Lack of team identity
-Offense is very stagnant, lots of iso ball besides Russ & Adams pick & roll
-Still experimenting with lineups this late
-Doesn’t seem to reprimand Russ and others for their blunders
-Abundance of coaching mistakes throughout the season
-Doesn’t make adjustments when they need to be made
-Can’t galvanize team for consistent effort

"I would like to preface this by saying that Russ has been my favorite player in the league since this team moved to OKC, so I don't think I need to point out what makes him great and all of that jazz.

That being said, I want to have an honest conversation about his defense. Last night he was really bad. I know he's never been considered a lockdown guard defender, but games when he's truly locked in (i.e against golden state and houston) it elevates (obviously) the team defense. I hate when you can tell from the first possession that he's taking the night off on defense. He won't fight over picks (which I think forces us to switch when we probably shouldn't be), he'll wander around the baseline, leave his man open from 3, not closeout on shooters. Of course, Roberson made up for a lot of those mistakes the same way Ibaka used to as a rim defender. 

Last year I gave Russ the benefit of the doubt because of the load he was carrying on offense, but man, this year there have been games where he is just not locked in at all.","The Brodie I would like to preface this by saying that Russ has been my favorite player in the league since this team moved to OKC, so I don't think I need to point out what makes him great and all of that jazz.

"I'm not trying to rain (no pun intended) on everyone's parade here, but after reading a few posts in the last few days about playoff seeding and winning a title I decided to look something up.

A seed lower than 3 has only won the NBA title twice, last happening in 1995 when the 6 seed Houston Rockets won the title. The other time was the 4 seed Boston Celtics in 1969. No 5, 7, or 8 seed has ever won a championship.

Only 7 3 seeds have ever won a title, the last being the 2011 Dallas Mavericks. 

59 out of 68 NBA Finals have been won by a 1 or 2 seed.

It is totally realistic and fair to expect a second round or WCF playoff run, but I'm just trying to think rationally.

"At this point, the 3 seed looks out of reach.  I think that it is to our advantage to be in the GSW’s side of the bracket, as I think we match up better with them than with Houston, and also it would be so sweet to beat KD.  If this is true, then our options are reduced to the 6th seed and the 7th seed.  As the sixth seed, we play Portland in the first round, and while optimistic, that’s not a series I want to play.  If we get the 7th seed, we can play the warriors likely without Curry, being led by the reptilian self-proclaimed non leader.  I like our chances in such a series, and it would give us a ton of confidence heading into round two.  I hope those in the Thunder organization are at least thinking about possible ways to make this happen… I realize that gunning for the 7th seed is playing with fire, but I just think it is the ideal situation.

"I am worried about The Thunder, not yet, but can not be happy with the development right now. Theres a buch of stuff that doesnt seem to work.

Assists.   Yesterday agaist Portland for example, is like they stop sharing the ball and play only ISO.

Shoot selection.  Bad choices. Example: Anthony shoot two 3 in less than a 3 seconds,  common stop and make a play, if you have a bad night dont force it.  

Plays.  Dont have one. Even Hawk play is not there anymore.

If Felton doesnt have a good day. The bench is like out.   Sometines Grant is haveng a good day.   

There have been like a lot of games with bad ""luck"" with the score. Its like the ball doesnt whant to go in,  that frustrate the players and do dumn stuff.

Adams is so consistent, maybe the best player with RW.

Need to trust more in Felton, Pat, Grant, Evem Abrines. Sit more players that dont have a good night,  they can survive one game sitting down. 

The record hurts bacause OKC have lost games because dumb shoot selecction in the last shoot ( agaist Detroit lost by 1). Or because the refeeres are blind ( Bucks, Min, Etc)

The losts agaist Portland and Celtics it wasnt because Anthony.  All the team was like zzz.  

I know they are good, with or whitout AR. But they need to focus better.  

Give them some time?  Mmm. They already have that.    I hope they wake up in playoffs,  if they reach them because playing like that we are in danger.  And positions 7,8,9 are not a good spot to play in the first key.

"Just curious, because obviously Melo is a negative asset, but at least he's coming off the books. Griffin on the other hand is still probably worth his money (or at least *way* more than Melo) but probably won't be by the end of the contract. Similarly Westbrook will take up tons of cap and probably won't be worth his salary by the end of his contract either.

Griffin isn't a better shooter than Melo (but Melo has been garbage this year), but he's at least a much better facilitator (and not a black hole), more athletic, faster, better rebounder, and better defender, which are also big improvements over Melo.

So would you do the trade?","Even though Melo would waive his NTC for this, would you trade Melo for Blake Griffin in the upcoming offseason (assume PG stays and signs either a full max or a 2 year deal) Just curious, because obviously Melo is a negative asset, but at least he's coming off the books.

"Ferg puts up yet another empty stat line 0-0-0 with 14 big minutes.

"Why the fuck is he playing Paul George for like 15 straight minutes of game time in the regular season? The last couple times I watched you guys he didn't come out until the 9 min mark or so of the 2nd quarter. He seemed to be missing shots and turning it over quite a bit since he was probably gassed being the only one of the Big 3 out there to end the 1st quarter and start the 2nd quarter during that stretch. 

Is Billy Donovan just not a good coach? I'm starting to believe this since he also never changes his defensive scheme. Since the start of the year, it seems like you guys just switch on every pick and roll or off ball screen so that Steven Adams has to chase elite guards and Westbrook can continue to put in little to no effort on defense.

"Thunder still have no clue how to beat a team that packs the paint.

And it sucked most because I don't think the bigs of Boston are that great. Horford is an amazing stretch 5 but he's not a rim protector. Baynes is big and a great shot but not a phenomenal defender.

I thought we did a ton of settling for jumpers BUT we also missed some really makeable, open shots. Idk if this ends Corey Brewer hotness but I've got no clue how we just can't hit a shot even when wide open. I mean Melo and CB had some great opportunities.

Anywho, if we can't figure that out for the post season, it will be a quick one for us. I've not seen us play a great game where a team goes to protect the paint.","The biggest problem I noticed... Thunder still have no clue how to beat a team that packs the paint.

"Everyone has been saying throughout all the season that this team can win against anyone, and this is potentially true. To be honest, at the moment I find myself among those who tend to think that this team can lose against everyone, rather than win. The fact we have 3 superstars (even if they're not always playing as their status requires them to play) bring us to believe that this team will be able to make a deep playoffs run. What I'm worried about is the terrible attitude that this team has consistently shown on multiple games this season. Think about all the blown leads and all the losses against trash teams. Last night game against the Celtics was the worst game of the season (and I would say this even if we won), they seemed to play to do someone else a favour. Even if this team has a huge potential, even if we had some great win, even if we've been able to put up some solid winning streaks, I never had that feeling of dominance I had in the past years. When KD and Ibaka were out there, you just knew they were going out there and closing the easy games in 3 quarters. This Thunder team is a big question mark every night, regardless the team we're facing. Honestly I don't see how we can win 4 out of 7 games against either the Warriors or the Rockets, especially with this embarassing bench (outscored 35-10 by the Celtics' bench last night smh). I hope our guys will prove myself wrong. I have faith but at the same time I have to be realistic.

"Probably gonna get downvoted considering the state this sub is in rn, but I really find the “Practice free throw” posts and comments annoying.

I know some players are just really bad at free throws like Roberson(or the whole Thunder team right now). I was devastated to see Melo miss the free throws, too. But hell, even players like Harden misses free throws.

Everyone in this sub can make free throws, but in a game there are a lot of factors to take into account. Fatigue, physical intensity of the game, minites played, mentality, and luck.

You can miss a ft when you’re up 25, you can miss 2 clutch fts when you’re up 2 late in the 4th quarter. That’s just how it is.

It’s like most people really think these players don’t practice free throw at all.

"Saw a post on r/nba about the all NBA teams and OP had Kyrie over Russ for 2nd team. That's his opinion and that's fine but I started making my case for Russ and well got long winded...


**Just the stats**: 

Kyrie 24.4/3.8/5.1

Westbrook 25.3/9.7/10.2

Russ has 3x as many rebounds (best rebounding guard in the league bar none even if you take out any ""stat padding boards"" he's easily over 8 a game). Russ also has TWICE as many assists (they're both point guard remember?) and *leads the league in dimes* while still averaging more points. 


**Efficiency**:

Kyrie does have better percentages across the board but aside from 3p% Russ is league average or better at the basic % numbers.  Certainly the edge goes to Kyrie here.


**Clutch/Leadership**:

Kyrie benefits from having a FAR superior coach. He's really clutch but at best he's equal or slightly less clutch than Westbrook. Any argument such as Russ ""isn't fun to play with"" or ""he dribbles the air out of the ball"" doesn't hold water here. Kyrie is a much worse passer & does as much pounding the rock and jacking shots. 


**Advanced Stats**:

Pretty equal PER's and win shares while Russ has a higher FT rate. 

In regards to Usage Rate. Russ is at 34% and Kyrie 31%. Both top 8 league wide. So I don't want to hear any lazy ""Russell has the ball the entire time"" arguments. 

While Russ doesn't have his historic VORP or box score plus minus he had last year he's still markedly ahead of Kyrie (8.0/6.4 to 6.4/4.1). Kyrie is 12th in VORP and 8th in BPM while Russ is 3rd and 4th respectively. 


**The random shit**: Did you know Russell is *5th in total rebounds this year*? He has more rebounds than AD, Giannis, Lebron, Embiid & Jokic. I don't give a damn about a few ""rebound hunting boards per game"" this is a 6'3 POINT GUARD being top 5 in the league in rebounds. 

Brodie has nearly 100 assists more than second place. (717 to Lebron's 631... 3rd highest is Harden with 542). That's a ridiculous lead especially for a guy putting up 25+ ppg and thought of as ""selfish"". He's one of the league best passers and playmakers and miles better at either than Kyrie. (Remember the usage rates are nearly identical and Kyrie puts up less than half of Russ' assists).


**Defense**: Russ is *3rd in defensive win shares*. It's a weird stat with a lot of factors going into it but 3rd is 3rd. 

Russell is 4th in steals. He's 7th in SPG. Kyrie isn't even top 50. 

Basically on defense neither guy is considered good. Russ is bigger and doesn't get killed on the block or abused in switches as easily. Russ also creates more turnovers (most times leading directly to a fast break basket) and absolutely soars for rebounds any other point guard in the league could only dream of. I'd give the definite edge to Russ in terms of defense. 


**Team Success**: This certainly matters but with the injuries the Celtics have right now they may very well only be 3 games ahead in the win column after tonight. It's certainly fair to point out OKC is in the much more difficult conference and don't forget about the divisions. The division opponents you play more than any other team... OKC has Portland, Utah, Denver and Minnesota... all playoff caliber teams in division. Boston has Toronto, Philly and the lowly Nets/Knicks. Boston is 10-3 in division. Meanwhile the northwest division is a bloodbath.


All things considered if OKC finishes <5-7 games behind Boston while playing in the much harder conference with the toughest division I'd call that a push. 


**Health**:

This is the biggest factor for me and clearly puts Russ ahead. Westbrook has played in 97% percent of his teams games (70/72). Kyrie has missed 10 games (60/70) and will likely miss a handful more if not the rest of the regular season. With 12 games to go and the Celts up 6 games on the Cavs and down 5 on the Raps it wouldn't surprise me if Kyrie plays at most a couple of ""knock the rust off"" games to finish the year. Meanwhile the West will likely come down to the final game. 

So we have one guy likely playing in 79-80 games and the other playing 60-65. That's a BIG DEAL. I get you can be dominant and not play the entire year (see Joel Embiid ROY debate just last year) but in regards to ALL NBA missing a quarter of the season is just too much in a discussion this close.  

Edit: So Kyrie could play as early as this week but he's risking getting reinjured and would be playing less than 100% anyway. He's getting a second opinion and if he gets the screws out he's basically done for the regular season.

https://twitter.com/TonyMassarotti/status/976198335433465857


**Highlight Reel**: It shouldn't matter in terms of All NBA but honestly guys, who's more fun to watch? Kyrie gets buckets. Westbrook makes plays no other player in the league can make. Kyrie can finish as well as anyone but NOBODY can get to the bucket like Russ. He'll turn a 1 on 3 into an and 1. He'll leap over centers to grab second chance points. He just has so many more ""holy shit that stat line!"" games or ""dear god what a move/rebound/steal/hustle play"". This isn't meant to discredit Kyrie either. He probably has the leagues best handles and is an unreal shot maker. Other than basically iso scoring he doesn't hold a candle to the incredible things Russ can do.

**In Summary**: Both guys can absolutely light it up and carry a team by scoring. Both guys have huge usage rates and the teams runs through them especially at the end of games. 

Kyrie *is much more efficient*. That's the biggest factor in his favor. Aside from that though...

Russ is not just a better passer, he's *leading the league by a wide margin*. 

Kyrie may not even be a league average rebounder for a PG. Russell on the other hand is *a historically great rebounder for his position* and stud on the boards regardless of position. 


Basically other than Russ being less efficient than Kyrie he's better in every regard. FTR, BPM, VORP by a solid amount and steals, assists and rebounds by leaps and bounds. If Boston had continued to win at it's early season pace and Kyrie not gotten injured then i'd certainly buy into a pro Kyrie argument but Kyrie might play 20 less games and while both teams have had ups and downs when the dust settles OKC could very well be only a few games back of Boston despite the schedules. 


Edit: Last point. Kyrie is sick ok... don't come at me with some ""ur a h8tr crap"". I like Kyrie's game. Russ is just a better player. 

When talking about top 5 or so players its' Lebron, Harden, Curry, KD with Russ, AD Giannis in some order. When was the last time you saw a post, heard a podcast or argued with a buddy that seriously believed Kyrie is better than Russ. He's top 10-15 or so for sure. But this is the ALL NBA TEAM. One of the biggest historical markers we have. Simply put whether this year or 10, 20 years from now when you look at this season as a whole and ask yourself honestly ""who was a better player in 2018 Westbrook or Irving"" you would have a tough time reasoning Irving.

"Maybe I’m just a little biased because I really want A3nes to do well on this team, but I feel like he has really stepped it up in the past couple of games. He’s not fouling as much on the defensive end, and he’s also making some great defensive plays (a couple of blocks recently if I recall correctly). On the offensive end, his shooting has been okay, but he has also kept the ball moving. It’s not necessarily passing, but he isn’t playing as just a catch and shoot player with the bench unit. I think that’s been really useful in helping the bench be more successful. He also just looks like he is full of energy out there. We all talk about Westbrook’s drive, and now Brewer’s raw energy, but Abrines looks like he’s giving it 110% every time he steps onto the court. 

He’s not the best player, but I think what he has been bringing to the table recently is perfect for the Thunder.","Has anyone else noticed huge improvement from Abrines?

"We visit the 5 teams with better records than ours once each before the end of the season. And Celtics and GSW have some nagging issues that will allow us to probably catch a really depleted team. And then we meet the Blazers at home. And then we meet the Rockets 2 games before the end of their season. If they've clinched first they might be resting guys.

The other 6 teams, I think we're much better than. Talent-wise, I think we have a lot more options and we're on a much better roll right now. Miami twice? Spurs? Pelicans? Nuggets? And then we close with Memphis. I think they'll be good games, but I just think we have more talent. Last we played the Nuggets and Pelicans we didn't have Corey or Robes. Spurs we just demolished with Roberson. 

I think they'll be great games, much like the Clippers games, but I think we'll probably pull them out.

Shit, I think the Blazer's schedule is worse. They have LAC twice. HOU twice. And then they have to close out to potential seed-helping games with the Nuggets, Spurs, Utah. May not be able to rest much (depends if the other teams are fighting or not). Not to mention, I just don't think the Blazers are that great.

Anywho. We're back to looking like we should look. We are the 4th seed. We're on a 5 game winning streak. Still a top 6 record in the league. Top 10 defense. Our bench is coming around. PG is snapping out of suckiness. It's a fine time to be positive, pals.","I look at our remaining schedule and don't think it's that bad...

"I'm not gonna lie I severely underestimated the impact Corey Brewer has on this Thunder team.  When Roberson went down, the Thunder struggled to adjust to Roberson's absence on both offense and especially defense.  They were a different team.  Roberson's length and elite defensive abilities along with his constant off ball movement perfectly complimented WB and PG.

Brewer IMO has been the perfect Roberson substitute so far.  

Is Brewer as good as Roberson defensively?  No he's not.  But Brewer's defense has been good enough and pairs perfectly with WB and PG.  He averages 2 steals a game with the Thunder allowing the Thunder to wreak havoc again on defense.

Offensively is where Brewer definitely outshines Roberson.  Brewer has shown he can hit that corner 3, cuts just as well, as is a speed demon the fast break.  WB and Brewer might be the fastest backcourt on the fast break in the league.  Brewer has also been able to hit his free throws.

I originally thought starting Heustis saved the season but I started realize Heustis serves best as a defensive specialist off the bench.  Outside of Heustis, the wing player defense off the bench drops dramatically.  Now with Brewer, that is not the case.  Your GM pulled off another with this Brewer signing.  I am excited to see how your team rides this momentum going into the playoffs.  If this team manages to reach 50 wins with the hardest finishing schedule in the league, I am will be confident enough to say they can beat any team in the playoffs.

Since the fall of Andre, Son of Robes, our heroes have faced many obstacles, much adversity, and very, very few successes.  Lady Luck has seemed to turn her head every chance she gets, forcing our heroes to act alone, or fall.  And that's not very nice of her.  Since their friend Andre had fallen in battle, it feels as though an eternity of hell has passed them by.  Fighting tooth and nail among many men, wizards and warlocks, knights and barbarians, the dreary eyes of Sir Brook of West scream ""Why can't we catch a fuckin break!""

The trials of our men are as follows:  A loss to the yellow shirts and Lonzo of the Lakes, a grizzly battle and triumph over a pack of bears, another skirmish, but unfortunate loss to King James and his Caveliers, and another win over the same bears who came trodding back for revenge. 

Two of our men were invited to a shindig out West for a parry among the greats of the nation.  Sir Brook of West shined of the sun, while Saint PG, 13th of his name returned home shell shocked.  To this day, no single soul knows why, however, his spirit which was once broken, seems to be mending. 

A win over a squad of kings, a hard battle and failure over the stupid ass warriors, a win against mages, a success over wild stallions, and yes, They even fought the fucking Sun and won!

However, this is where the story gets interesting.  So pay close attention. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Our men were in the Northwestern part of their land.  They traveled far in search of a missing piece to their unfinished puzzle of a squad.  Upon entering their town, they were tired, hungry, and thirsty and decided to rest for the eve.  Before retiring, however, they stopped at a local tavern.  They approached the bar and seated themselves as the bar tender came and gathered their drinks.  

He was a tall, slender man built like a seedling.  His hair was nonexistent except for a patch around his jaw.  His eyes were bright and filled with hope, and a smile stretched across his face for miles.  He looked at Sir Brook of West and said ""Can I interest you in our local house brew?  I make it myself in back!""

Sir Brook hesitates but ultimately agrees to the drink.  He tips the bar tender a pence and the gentleman comes back with a pint of hard corn liquor.  Sir Brook tastes it and immediately winces. ""Aye, bar keep!  This drink is mighty spicy!  What is it made of?""

The keep smiles once more and reiterates, ""It's made of corn sir.""

Squire Kiwi reaches out for a sip.  Upon touching his lips, he opens his throat and seems to swallow the drink whole.  He slams it on the counter, wipes his mustache, looks at Sir Melo and Saint PG and exclaims ""Aye! Bottoms up, Mate!""

Kiwi looks back at the bar keep, and asks for one more.

""What do you call this firey drink anyway?""  Squire Kiwi asks. 

The bar keep turns in a dramatic way that can't be represented by writing so just imagine that his face is lit with candlelight and you can only see half of his face.

""Well sir, I simply call it a Corn Brew.  Made by me, Corey the Brewer.""

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Time has passed and our heroes had grown pissed with alcohol.  Joking and laughing with the bar keep, he reflects once more on his evening and looks again at the exhausted gentlemen.  He asks if they're in town for the festivities due to the arms they are packing.  He proceeds to tell them stories of his time in the field. 

""I don't get much action any more due to my age, but I have been aching for a chance to wield once more.""  Corey the Brewer States. 

A drunken Sir Brook looks at him through droopy eyes and says while laughing, ""Well Corey the Brewer, if you travel with us, I will ensure you many battles in your near future.""

Corey the Brewer smiles, yet remains silent.  While cleaning mugs and listening to the stories Sir Brook and His men are telling, he continues through his evening routine of bar keep.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

A few days passed since that night at the tavern.  They lost the competition to the local Trail Riders of the Northwest and were back at home.  On the outskirts of town, our heroes were in the middle of diffusing a space ascending jettison device, but were failing due to their lack of knowledge on the damn things.  

Our men were in a full panic.  The rocket had a timer that wouldn't shut down, and unfortunately, they knew nothing of the aftermath if they couldn't diffuse it.  All of our men were feverishly working at dismantling this propulsion device to the point, once more, of exhaustion.  

After hours of hard work, sweat, blood, and lots of bull fuckery, a friendly voice speaks behind them.

""You're too far gone men, but I've worked with enough of these things, I may be able to set it off course at least.""

Sir Brook turns around and smiles at the sight of Corey the Brewer.  

""Be my guest"" Sir Brook says as he shimmies away. 

Corey the Brewer kneels by the device, and with the magic of motion pictures, hacks the main frame.  With sweat dripping from his forehead, he stand and steps back.  He turns to our heroes and calmly says ""Okay men, it's time to run now.""

Our heroes retreat back to Castle Chesapeake with haste while the rocket begins to smoke and roar.  With the shout of banshees, it launches towards the evening sky.  Our men turn to look as the device explodes and showers the town with sparks and fire that read:

 ""#WhyNot""

Sir Brook and His men cheer and laugh while the message fizzles out and falls back down to earth.  He then turns to Corey the Brewer, who is smiling from ear to ear, extends a hand, and proudly welcomes him to join his men in battle...

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The rainy days are nearing their end with the addition of Corey the Brewer joining our heroes.  Equipping himself with whips, he brings a heat to the battle that is reminiscent of Andre, Son of Robes.  He is quick like a cobra, light as a feather, and has found his place in the field once more.  He fights as though he has a something to prove and has given hope to our heroes once more.

With four recent battles notched under his belt, I would say Corey (the Score Settling Brewer) has found life again and is eager to journey once more, hoping to help win a sought after victory over the warriors once and for all. 

To be continued...

So to everyone who was at least a little upset we didn't make a move for him, you can rest a little easier knowing Presti wasn't just being lazy or stubborn.

"If the playoffs started tomorrow and the seeds stayed how they are we'd be the 4th seed and would have to play New Orleans. Then the next round we would play Houston.

He really might end up being that glue guy like Roberson was, playing great team defense, getting steals, cutting to the rim, running on the break—and if he can hit those corner threes like he did tonight, well, shit, things might REALLY be looking up.

-Westbrook played much more under control tonight. Only TWO turnovers all night, shot a high percentage, and didn't take any threes. That's the ""good"" Russ that we need!

-PG shot the three ball better than he has in weeks. If he gets that stroke working again consistently, it changes the effectiveness of our offense tremendously.

-BALANCED scoring from the starters. Everyone in double digits. And then in the fourth, watching from the bench, Melo and Russ looked engaged and like they were actually having FUN. It was great.

This really felt like a game that we can build upon. Saturday's game at home against San Antonio is very winnable, then we have two games next week against basement dwellers to further develop chemistry with Brewer in the starting lineup before the schedule gets tough later in the month.

"I've been chewing on this for a few weeks. 

We had Scott Brooks. That was in the good ole days when we had KD and Russ as our 2 man show. Scott Brooks was often criticized for his use of ""Scotts Secrit Plays"" which was basically ""give the ball to KD or Russ and let them ISO"". We also had a better bench and supporting cast in those days so the flaws of going to ISO in tight situations could be better hidden, not to mention KD is unguardable and one of the best shooters of all time so that doesn't hurt. 

Now, Scott and KD are gone. Russ' shooting has *never* been his strength. It has always been his ability to pick apart a defense, or just drive in with raw power and get it done. Now, last year we saw Russ hit an ungodly amount of clutch shots and I think it has skewed our perception of him as a shooter. He has never had a high TS%. This season isn't so much his shooting falling off, but more just regressing to the mean imo. His free throws is another story, but that's unimportant for this post. 

So last year we didn't play team ball either. It was a ton of Russ iso which resulted in a top 5 all time season for any player in league history. Russ went bananas. We didn't have high expectations so we weren't being *too* critical of the ISO ball. In this sub last year we all thought ""That's what we have to do. Nobody else can do anything."" Regardless of all that, last season was a lot of fun, but the ISO was still heavily present. 

Now, in the offseason, we literally sign King ISO and Prince ISO to go along with our own ISO King and all of us seem to be confused as to why we run so much ISO. It is my opinion that the Thunder front office absolutely 100% wants to play ISO ball. There's just no way that we've been accidentally playing ISO ball for damn near 5 years. It can't be just the coaches fault. It can't be just the players. I think it is and has been intentional from the top of our organization. For some reason, I have no idea why, they want us to play ISO ball. That's why KD left. He said it himself. The system isn't good. 

I'm thunder for life, but I'm sick of ISO ball. The league has evolved to team ball and 3 pointers and we've been left behind in ISO land running nothing but pick and rolls and post ups trying to sham god our way into a 1st round exit. I'm not being reactionary or negative about our team. I'm just calling it as I see it. The Thunder has been and will continue to be an ISO ball organization, and until we move past it I don't think we will win a championship. We have a player capable of dropping 20 dimes in one game and I just don't think we're running the right system for him *in the slightest*. Worst of all, we're stuck with King ISO next season because nobody else will pay him what we *have* to pay him. 

I personally hope Melo goes ring chasing and PG goes to LA so we can try to build a spot up shooter and defense lineup around Russ. I hope BD is fired and an actual coach is brought in instead of his ABC 123 scarecrow lookin ass. I hope everyone will wake up and see that this playstyle and coaching style doesn't work. Everyone in this sub can see that, why can't the ownership?

I'm sorry if this post is reactionary or seems like I hate the team. I promise I dont. I try to be as positive as possible in each game thread and I'm the 1st guy to tell people to give us time to get in a groove when we're down instead of saying we're gonna lose. I just don't think this experiment has worked, and I think the disease of ISO ball goes much further than our players and coaches.

Literally the worst thing that can happen to us is be a 7 or 8 seed. ",38,7,I'll be the one to say it,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/82lx00/ill_be_the_one_to_say_it/

"I'm not a writer, have been a big OKC fan 2 years before OKC was OKC. This is my frustration with Billy Donovan. 

I have seen people backing Donovan and people knocking him. I was excited when he was hired but now feel like we need to move on. I would love to know what Billy does that no other coach can.

I've heard 3 arguments supporting him. His success in college, he is playing chess not checkers with the line ups, it's players and  he's doing the best with what he has.

Success in college doesn't translate to NBA as everyone knows. Billy Donovan coached at a major school. I'd argue his ability to recruit was just as important as his ability to coach. Being at a Flordia he could get talented players that could carry the team. The 06 07 team that won the championship had Horford, Brewer, Noah, Speights. All players that made names in NBA. I understand someone still has to coach that team and put it together but you don't need the Midas touch to win the NCAA tourney with that team. Recruiting is just as important as coaching in college. 

The idea that Donovan is playing chess not checkers and  is waiting out the playoffs to play a Russ, pg , melo, pp, Adams line up doesn't add up. Limiting a special playoff line up is understandable.Not ever testing it doesn't make sense unless you're at the top aka GSW/Rockets. No matter how much you practice something or try to make practice harder than the game it isn't.  

Players obviously impact the game and it's not all about the coach I don't want to direct blame unfairly, but what does Donovan do for the Thunder? 

Player development?  He hasn't had many players to develop since coming to OKC so it's hard to judge, but it's hard to expect development from Abrines or Ferguson given their seemingly random playing time and hard to understand role,from a fan perspective.

Controlling the huddle? I haven't heard any stats or praise for how strong OKC is out of a time out, or after a quarter, let's not mention starting the 3rd quarter after half time. Some coaches excel at half time adjustments or great shots out of time out. Where does Billy fall.

Player adjustments? Donovan seems to shift players around all the time. Early in the season it wasn't just bench, it was Russ, pg, melo. 3 players not only learning to get along but being given different minutes every night. I never understood how that was beneficial. Let the get comfortable then start make adjustments. The big question of why there hasn't been a Russ, pg, melo, pp, Adams line up. If people watching the game see the potential why hasn't it happened for at least a quarter. I'd give some slack if it wasn't for watching last year when oladipo wasn't used at the point that spot until it was too late. 

I want to know where the team is better for having Billy coach because I can't see it on my own. Even with success in the playoffs if Donovans importance isn't proved I think the organization needs to take a hard look at him.

"**2017-18 Salary Cap**: $99,093,000

**1. Trade Alex Abrines and Patrick Patterson for Danny Green.** 

**Green**: one year left (‘18/‘19) with a player option in his contract worth $10,000,000 exactly.
**Abrines**: one year left as well in his contract worth $5,455,236. 
**Patterson**: two years left on his contract. In the ‘18/‘19 season, he is guaranteed $5,451,600. In the ‘19/‘20 season, he is guaranteed $5,711,200 with a player option. 

**Pros**: At an acceptable 30-years-old, Danny Green is averaging 1.5 catch-and-shoot 3s per game on 40.1% which would prove to guarantee quick points and chip away at our irritating habit of dribbling around before taking a shot. In fact, Green is at his best from deep without dribbling at all. I’m not the best at finding defensive statistics, but Danny’s ‘17/‘18 DBPM is 2.3 so he can defend. Financially, this move would knock off $906,836 in the ‘18/‘19 season and $5,711,200 in the ‘19/‘20 season. 

**Cons**: Two players for one and no draft picks (the Spurs don’t have any) is never ideal. As far as Danny Green’s age, 30 is neither old nor young which is tricky and potentially detrimental if he were to worsen with age and we re-sign him. 

**Why would the Spurs do that?** Alex Abrines is a young player with room to grow and an already serviceable 3-point shot. He’s shown flashes of defensive ability and athleticism that can be molded to Pop’s standards. Patrick Patterson is only 28 with a proven role-player resume and enough left in the tank to be apart of a potential future San Antonio trade. 

**2. Stretch Carmelo Anthony’s contract or trade him to a contender he’s approved.** 

This one’s difficult. While the road has been bumpy at times, Carmelo Anthony is still Carmelo Anthony. But money is tight and we can’t have ‘Melo’s contract weighing down on us, preventing future opportunities. It is more likely that ‘Melo will not agree to stretch his contract so let’s explore a trade option. 

**Toronto Raptors**: While they’re not as impressive as the some contendors, the Raptors are not to be overlooked as they’ve shown promise over the last few years. Toronto is also a lot closer to home for ‘Melo and the city’s fun. I say **Carmelo Anthony for C.J. Miles and Pascal Siakam**. 

Both Miles and Siakam are signed until the ‘19/‘20 season, but since we’re trying to figure out next year only for the time being, here are their salaries for ‘18/‘19 season. 

**Miles**: $8,333,333
**Siakam**: $1,544,951

**Pros**: C.J. Miles is another threat from deep at 39% (his current statistics: 10.3/0.7/1.9). Pascal Siakam is extremely young (23) and another big man that would help us off the bench. Can he defend? Yes. He’s also averaging 7 points and 4.5 rebounds.

**Cons**: Miles isn’t young and is not the best defender. Siakam cannot shoot from 3. 

Continuing on.

**3. Trade Kyle Singler, Dakari Johnson, and Terrance Ferguson for Justin Holiday and Robin Lopez.**

Obviously, we all want to get rid of Singler, but not everyone wants to see Ferguson go. Why do I not mind letting another team have him? We’re in win-now mode even if we re-sign Paul George and Ferguson becoming a star on another team is a chance I’m willing to take to snag a ring. Dakari has been thrown into the mix because he’s young, to somewhat match salaries, and despite Ferguson’s talents, a Ferguson/Singler combination is not enough in my opinion talent-wise. 

Holiday and Lopez are both free agents at the end of next season. Chicago is not going to become a contender overnight so I imagine their front office is going to want something in return for them as opposed to letting them walk after the 2019 season. 

‘18/‘19 salaries for everyone aforementioned:
**Singler**: $4,996,000
**Johnson**: $1,378,242
**Ferguson**: $2,118,840
OKC total: $8,493,082

**Holiday**: $4,384,616
**Lopez**: $14,357,750
Chicago total: $18,742,366

**Pros**: Justin Holiday would be a fantastic bench shooting guard and obviously no one would complain about Lopez coming in after Adams. Their statistics speak for themselves (Holiday this year: 13/2.3/4.5 on 37/37/82 splits, Lopez: 12.3 points and 4.7 rebounds with both offensive and defensive rebound averages almost equal). 

**Cons**: Expensive. 

**4. Sign Trevor Ariza if Paul George does not re-sign.**

Ariza is only signed for the remainder of this season and therefore could be signed in the offseason with a different salary. His ‘17/‘18 salary: $7,420,912

**Pros**: Trevor Ariza is a 39% shooter from deep averaging 12 points and an okay defender with veteran presence, size. At 32, Ariza could possibly be acquired for even less than he’s making this year due to age. 

**Cons**: Ariza isn’t getting any younger. 

With everything into consideration, our salaries next year would look like this so far: 

**Starters**
Russell Westbrook (PG): $35,350,000
Danny Green (SG): $10,000,000
Paul George (assuming he re-signs) (SF): $20,703,384 
Trevor Ariza (assuming Paul George does not re-sign) (SF): $7,420,912
Andre Roberson (PF): $10,000,000 
Steven Adams (C): $24,157,303

**Bench**
Justin Holiday (SG): $4,384,616
C.J. Miles (SF): $8,333,333
Pascal Siakam (PF): $1,544,951
Robin Lopez (C): $14,357,750

Felton, Grant, Huestis, and Collison are not signed for next year so I obviously I did not include them. 

Before these changes, our guaranteed players for next year with George ran a price of **$137,538,745**. After these changes, our hypothetical lineup next year with George runs a price of **$128,831,337**. Without George, but with Ariza? That price is ** $115,548,865**. 

With these changes, we have either **$8,707,408 (with PG13)** or **$21,989,880 (without PG13)** that we previously didn’t have to resign Grant, Huestis, and Felton or another bench PG. 

Feel free to correct anything I might have incorrect or throw in other suggestions. I realize this isn’t going to 100% fix everything, but it’s a start. Thank you for reading. 

","My Proposition for Offseason Moves **2017-18 Salary Cap**: $99,093,000

**1. Trade Alex Abrines and Patrick Patterson for Danny Green.** 

**Green**: one year left (‘18/‘19) with a player option in his contract worth $10,000,000 exactly.
**Abrines**: one year left as well in his contract worth $5,455,236. 
**Patterson**: two years left on his contract. In the ‘18/‘19 season, he is guaranteed $5,451,600. In the ‘19/‘20 season, he is guaranteed $5,711,200 with a player option. 

**Pros**: At an acceptable 30-years-old, Danny Green is averaging 1.5 catch-and-shoot 3s per game on 40.1% which would prove to guarantee quick points and chip away at our irritating habit of dribbling around before taking a shot. In fact, Green is at his best from deep without dribbling at all. I’m not the best at finding defensive statistics, but Danny’s ‘17/‘18 DBPM is 2.3 so he can defend. Financially, this move would knock off $906,836 in the ‘18/‘19 season and $5,711,200 in the ‘19/‘20 season. 

**Cons**: Two players for one and no draft picks (the Spurs don’t have any) is never ideal. As far as Danny Green’s age, 30 is neither old nor young which is tricky and potentially detrimental if he were to worsen with age and we re-sign him. 

**Why would the Spurs do that?** Alex Abrines is a young player with room to grow and an already serviceable 3-point shot. He’s shown flashes of defensive ability and athleticism that can be molded to Pop’s standards. Patrick Patterson is only 28 with a proven role-player resume and enough left in the tank to be apart of a potential future San Antonio trade. 

**2. Stretch Carmelo Anthony’s contract or trade him to a contender he’s approved.** 

This one’s difficult. While the road has been bumpy at times, Carmelo Anthony is still Carmelo Anthony. But money is tight and we can’t have ‘Melo’s contract weighing down on us, preventing future opportunities. It is more likely that ‘Melo will not agree to stretch his contract so let’s explore a trade option. 

**Toronto Raptors**: While they’re not as impressive as the some contendors, the Raptors are not to be overlooked as they’ve shown promise over the last few years. Toronto is also a lot closer to home for ‘Melo and the city’s fun. I say **Carmelo Anthony for C.J. Miles and Pascal Siakam**. 

Both Miles and Siakam are signed until the ‘19/‘20 season, but since we’re trying to figure out next year only for the time being, here are their salaries for ‘18/‘19 season. 

**Miles**: $8,333,333
**Siakam**: $1,544,951

**Pros**: C.J. Miles is another threat from deep at 39% (his current statistics: 10.3/0.7/1.9). Pascal Siakam is extremely young (23) and another big man that would help us off the bench. Can he defend? Yes. He’s also averaging 7 points and 4.5 rebounds.

**Cons**: Miles isn’t young and is not the best defender. Siakam cannot shoot from 3. 

Continuing on.

**3. Trade Kyle Singler, Dakari Johnson, and Terrance Ferguson for Justin Holiday and Robin Lopez.**

Obviously, we all want to get rid of Singler, but not everyone wants to see Ferguson go. Why do I not mind letting another team have him? We’re in win-now mode even if we re-sign Paul George and Ferguson becoming a star on another team is a chance I’m willing to take to snag a ring. Dakari has been thrown into the mix because he’s young, to somewhat match salaries, and despite Ferguson’s talents, a Ferguson/Singler combination is not enough in my opinion talent-wise. 

Holiday and Lopez are both free agents at the end of next season. Chicago is not going to become a contender overnight so I imagine their front office is going to want something in return for them as opposed to letting them walk after the 2019 season. 

‘18/‘19 salaries for everyone aforementioned:
**Singler**: $4,996,000
**Johnson**: $1,378,242
**Ferguson**: $2,118,840
OKC total: $8,493,082

**Cons**: Expensive.

C: Literally played a dude who got to know the team for less than 24 hours.

"The reason these games are so close is because of our defense allows players to get into a good rhythm, so they start making shots even we do start playing good defense. Melo can’t defend. Seriously watch him on D. He doesn’t rotate well and he’s so slow that he has to leave so much space so he doesn’t get blown by. He’s our Curry, meaning that teams trying to take advantage of him by getting the switch, but he’s scoring 17 ppg on 16 shots. Those are rookie numbers. Seriously there is no excuse for that. He should not be playing 32 minutes while PPat is only getting 15 when he can actually defend. And when do start well, Melo starts going iso every time he gets the ball. For example, when Russ sat at the end of the first vs Dallas, PG and Melo were still there. Two times in a row Melo walks up the floor, iso, brick, and doesn’t get back on D and they  cut the lead down by 5. With no Roberson we NEED a solid defender to set the tone, not a liability who also can’t score.","We need start setting the tone defensively.

"Billy has been talking all season about improving ball movement and in the first quarters we usually seem to build a considerable lead due to our better ball movement. 

But as the game continues we become more stagnant!!! Why is this? It can't just be fatigue which causes us to lose our way. 

SCOTTY BROOKS was berated continuously in his last couple of seasons as Thunder coach because lack of ball movement seemed to be our biggest problem and the only plays he ever seemed to call were iso's for Russ and Snek. 

If anyone has watched the Wizards lately you will see they move the ball around phenomenally for 4 quarters and are doing really well in the east. Which makes you wonder was Scotty as terrible as we made out when it came to incorporating ball movement in the team or was it the players at his disposal?

The playing cast has changed significantly since Brooks was the coach, pretty much just Robes, Russ and Steve remain and of course Nick. 

So I ask you all, why the Thunder can't get this part of the game worked out? Does Russ kill ball movement in our offense? Is it a Presti directive that coaches are following? What is it?

"Obviously, we have yet to see how Corey brewer fits with this group of guys, but do you think he would be most effectively used coming off the bench, or starting?

From what I've seen from Corey Brewer over the years, I know hes a long 6'8""-6'9"" which makes him a versatile and active defender. He's athletic and is still only 31 and brings good experience (averaged 11 ppg off the bench in 17 playoff games for Houston in 2015). He's by no means a standout defender but he's a nice body to have out there, has the length similar to Roberson, and can switch 1-3 comfortably and 1-4 in certain lineups. Offensively, he gets a massive bulk of his points in transition. I think he plays well in a faster pace and flourishes when he catches the ball either on the move in stride on the wings or as a cutter. I don't think he's someone we can give the ball to in halfcourt situations and expect to go get a bucket. He's a decent spot-up three-point shooter and is by no means a liability -- probably just about as good as Huestis as a shooter. 

I personally think starting Brewer makes sense as I really think he could have an opportunity to shine offensively and give us some transition baskets, provide value as a cutter, and knock down spot up threes at a respectable rate. As a defender, I think his length and activity could complement that of PG and Westbrook well, in a manner similar to, but not quite at the same level as Roberson. But, starting Brewer means putting Huestis back with the second unit, which I'm honestly not a huge fan of, as Huestis really struggles to create for himself offensively and does not get the same open looks with the second unit as he does as a starter.

If Brewer we're to come off the bench I think he could occasionally take some of the load of Raymond Felton as someone who can just get a bucket when we really need one and could also provide defensive value to the second unit -- but I don't think he fits quite as well.  

I personally would like to see Brewer start, and I think that could provide us with a formidable 8-man rotation for the playoffs (Westbrook/Brewer/PG/Melo/Adams--Felton/Grant/Patterson; play Huestis and Abrines in certain situations/matchups), but I would not be totally opposed to him coming off the bench to provide some spark to an otherwise weak bench unit -- thoughts?

Edit: not talking about Brewer starting right off the bat -- moreso looking a couple weeks out from now","Should Corey Brewer start for this team?

"I'm pretty excited about the addition of Brewer so I looked into his stats, here's a few things I noticed:

1. He's only 31 (almost 32), I thought he was in his mid 30's like Tony allen.

2. While it's true that he's not a strong 3pt shooter (career 28%), he only attempts 2.2 threes per 36min, so he seems to know his limits and doesn't shoot them often, for reference, Roberson shoots 1.2 per 36.

3. Around the basket 0-3ft he's a career 61.7% shooter/finisher, Robes is 66.3% for his career and Pg13 is at a career 62.7%, so not bad at all.

4. With his height (6'9"") and length , he's capable of playing the 2, 3 and *sometimes* the 4 (he's a bit too skinny to bang down low with true 4's), he's yet another long, athletic, switchy athlete on our roster.

5. He's regarded as a hustle/energy type of defender, where as roberson is more of an iq/stay on your hip the entire night defender. 

My synopsis (if you care) is that he's a lengthy athlete who is at least a capable defender unlike abrines/ferguson who can put the ball on the floor to score (unlike abrines/huestis/ferguson) and gives us even more length. He's not a strong jump shooter (or catch and shoot) in really any area of the floor, but seems to know this and scores in transition or on cuts. He honestly reminds me of Jerami Grant if he was more perimeter oriented instead of a springy 4 who can shoot a little bit. Bottom line is that he helps fill the gaps we have at the 2 between abrines/ferguson/huestis.

My hopes are that we can attach him to the other teams best perimeter scorer and let scoring take a backseat like roberson did and let PG13 rest for a bit. At the absolute very least he's an extra defender we can use against harden/klay, etc, another body is another body.

"I was one of the ""reactionary"" post guys that was hoping BD would get the boot up the pooper after our teams woeful start to the season. 

Just wondering how everyone feels about him now. The last ""how do you feel post"" came about after our win streak so it was hardly representative. I feel like it's a better time to assess now. 

I've been a 3 year Billy denier - so I'll try and present some neutral points along with the bad: 

- He has had some success in establishing a lesser role for Melo whilst keeping him happy. 

- Our ball movement and spacing is better. 

- His shitty experimental rotations are the reason why we dropped some easy games (at least 5). We could easily be a comfortable 3 seed at this point. He still seems to be experimenting (maybe a moot point because of injuries). 

- Seemingly ignores lineup data (Melo was statistically better with the bench unit than PG). 

- Our permiter D still sucks. 

- We still constantly switch our bigs onto guards and watch them get burned without making adjustments (see upcoming Portland game). 

- Refuses to bench players that are playing terribly and single handedly blowing the game (Abrines on a number of occasions, Ferguson a few times) etc. 

- Doesn't seem to have a contingency plan if Adams gets injured. Dakari seemed to earn his minutes but has sat next to Singler since. 

- Actually seems like a nice guy and always has intersting things to say in interviews etc. 

Like I said, I'm biased af. Would be good for some others to assess amd maybe draw some more positives. I'm not calling for his head anymore, I just hope he can work with the team on the above before playoffs so we can make a decent run. 

P.S If my opinion is different to your, keep it civil. We are all Thunderbros.","Billy Donovan I was one of the ""reactionary"" post guys that was hoping BD would get the boot up the pooper after our teams woeful start to the season.

"In his 20 minutes, Huestis had a plus/minus rating of -1 which sounds underwhelming but comparatively, Melo and Melo were -26, Abrines was -30, Russ was -19, Adams was -6 George was -12.

I believe Huestis ' defense in the starting lineup is going to be key to us having any chance moving into the playoffs. What do you all think about the possibility he receives more minutes in the coming schedule?

After Dre's injury I've been searching for some optimism to suggest we can hang with the Rockets or Warriors. I definitely think we have a chance against any other Western conference team in a playoff round match-up but unless Huestis is given more opportunity and succeeds within a more substantial role, I am concerned about what options we have left or what tricks BD has up his sleeve.

"Despite the ugly score, we can take solace in the fact that our defense can be great even without Roberson. Huestis has really stepped up and according to Fred Katz the big 4 + Josh is our only net positive lineup right now. I'm pretty sure we have the worst half-court offense in the top 5 teams in the west. We NEED to get stops so that Russ can play in transition and that's where he's at his best and in turn the team is at it's best. 

Russ has really been struggling the last 10 games, with 22.8 ppg on 41%. It feels like he's been giving the ball up to PG and Melo too much kind of like earlier in the season and that's just not going to do it. PG doesn't need the ball in his hands as much as Russ does. It's not even about gsw's defense, he was also really bad vs the kings and had a lot of TOs. 

Now onto the odd rotations that we got in the Kings game. I think it's just Billy trying to get Abrines and T-ferg as much experience as possible to prepare them in case we need them. He saw that we were up big after that 1st quarter and thought hey why not? But the problem is that we didn't take control of the game even when Josh came back in sort of like the team had forgotten how to, and given the fact that we're one game away from being out of the playoffs I doubt we'll see T-ferg again except in garbage time and I think (hope) Josh will get more minutes. He has to get used to it because Abrines and T-ferg could end up being unplayable in the playoffs. Also there was a quote from Billy in one of the interviews about why sometimes he'll have Abrines play with starters and Josh withe the bench that I can't find now but it was something along the lines of Sometimes we need to think about other team second unit more than their starters depending on matchups or something like that. 

Three out of our next 4 games are vs tanking teams. No excuse not to go 3-1. We have our backs against the wall now so we better step up.

"I'll be honest, I didn't expect to win last night's game but I thought it would have gone much different. I thought GSW would come out and smack us in the mouth and we'd never be able to catch up.

Instead, we shot 29% in the first half and trailed by 7. That's it.

Russ and PG were missing WIDE OPEN SHOTS that they normally make. Hell, Westy missed about 3 layups that I can remember.

GSW had some better energy than the other games, but they didn't break it open until late in the 3rd. And they ran up the score because PG couldn't make a single shot as he manned the 4th quarter unit.

We sucked more than GSW was great, man and I really believe that. I didnt mind the rotations or the game plan -- we shot less than 40% for the game -- that won't win a lot of times.

"OKC has found the best replacement for Roberson in Josh Huestis. They have a 119.1 ORTG and 101.5 DRTG. Good for a fantastic 17.6 net rating.

OKC has the best starting 5 in the Western Conference. However, Presti and Donovan has been playing 10-11 man rotations every single game. 

Thus, OKC has alot of crap players outside of  Felton and Grant. This will be an interesting post season to see how OKC plays in the playoffs.

"NOTE: My post was deleted by the mods in r/nba despite it being well formatted/non shit post. Thought I’d share here for some opinions.

&nbsp;

Scrolling through the comments, I saw an unfortunate number of people who believe Zaza’s bodyslam was a mere accident. This is nothing but false. To refute the doubters, here is photo evidence along with in depth analysis to prove my case.

&nbsp;

[The Hook](https://imgur.com/a/D0pCZ)

&nbsp;

  In this photo it is clear that Zaza gets hooked by Swaggy P’s right foot. So yes, it’s true Zaza didn’t fall on his own. But don’t relax just yet since this offense just gets more blatant.

*****
&nbsp;

[The Hesitation](https://imgur.com/a/ElnCH)

&nbsp;

  Here you can see Zaza lose control of his balance. But from this view I believe he could withstand the pull from Nick Young’s foot. Besides he is a 7 ft 270 pound (122 kg) man. This is still arguable so let’s proceed to the next photo.

&nbsp;

[Hesitation Pt.2](https://imgur.com/a/dcF2A)

&nbsp;

  This is the biggest argument IMO. It is clear that Zaza could land with BOTH hands so he would avoid hitting Westbrook or at least soften the blow. But since he’s Zaza he predictably [leans toward his side](https://imgur.com/a/TMfQA) in order to maximize the damage done to the defending MVPs knees.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

  Hopefully this clears all the suspicions. Not sure how someone can defend a *basketball player* like Zaza. His career should’ve ended long ago but instead he’s given the easiest starting Center job in the league.","Analysing the Westbrook x Zaza incident NOTE: My post was deleted by the mods in r/nba despite it being well formatted/non shit post.

"League needs to do something about this...

Watched the replay 10 times. Zaza ""stumbles"" untouched and fell straight onto Westbrook's legs with his 250 pound body. If you watch the replay, Zaza clearly had complete balance, and he saw Westbrook on the ground and magically lost his balance. He is a master of making his dirty intent look as if it were a game play.

Pop has came out and legit named 10 dirty plays he's committed over the course of 3-4 years. For Pop to come out and trash someone, you know its gotta be bad.

Oh, and for those Warrior fans saying it was a game play, he did not try to break his fall, nothing. He saw Westy's legs and took aim. Just like he magically got right under Kawhi with the most unorthodox close I have ever seen in my life, he got this one right. Unlucky for him, Westy is fine.

League needs to legit do something about this. Its pathetic that the ""mighty"" Golden State Warriors who have assembled a ""dynasty"" have a bounty hunter on their team to intentionally go out and injure other teams star players.. just sad. 

You never hope injury on anyone, but I legit hope Zaza has a career ending injury soon. He needs to be kicked out of this league.

Sure enough, I do not expect the NBA to do anything about this either. They are too scared to do anything to potentially hurt their baby the GSW.

"Alright guys, I know we are all super hardcore thunder fans, and we all love this team a lot so it’s easy to overreact, but let’s take a step back for a minute.

Yes, both Russ and (especially) PG didn’t have the best game tonight, but these things happen. I want to applaud the hustle that I have seen from both Adams and PG in the fourth quarter, even in the face of overwhelming defeat. Of course I already had a lot of respect for these players before tonight, but these actions reinforced my thoughts. 

We are still up 2-1 against the warriors this season. I hate the warriors and KD as much as the next OKC fan, but we have to admit they are a good team, and the fact that we are 2-1 against them this season is still impressive. We had a rough game, but guys I promise our players will fight. Russ will fight. Adams will fight. PG will fight. And after tonight, Melo will most definitely fight.

Adams played super well. The man is a blessing not only to our team, but humanity as a whole. With us not having a bad shooting night, we would have been right in this game. I know our bench isn’t the best, and we most definitely have problems, but the fact that we were competitive through the 3rd quarter with a combined under 20 points from Russ and PG shows that we can still fight and stay close in a bad game. 

I guess this is all to say, THUNDER THE FUCK UP GUYS. It’s one bad game, but there are some positives we can take from it. This team needs us. We have a chance at the conference finals at least. Let’s stay behind this team. They need our love, let’s give it to ‘em! We recover, we look at went wrong, and we come back. We love this team, and I’m confident that they love us all back, let’s show them that we will stay with them in the thought times! 

Also, fuck Zaza. Definitely an intentional fall on Russ to try and injure him, but glad Russ is alright. The NBA needs to do something about that dirty shit. Good thing Russ is too tough for that dirty shit.

"So with the news that Rose's agent has OKC on the phone and that we're interested in Noah (we obviously want to be the Oklahoma City Knicks), would you try to buyout Dakari or some other roster spot to get these guys?

We're also interested in Tony Allen and Ilyasova (but last I heard, Ily wasn't into us). Also Bogut is available.

We owe Dakari about 2.1m. I figure we'd sign a SG and a C for that combined.

I don't think it takes us 'over the top' in a sense of replacing Robes but I do kinda like the idea of this bench line-up

Ray/Rose(or Allen)/Grant/2Pat/Noah(or Bogut)

I like having two ball handlers that can create on a broken play. If Noah has any bit of defense in him, that'd be awesome next to 2Pat, who can stretch the floor. Jerami is always a mismatch nightmare wherever he plays and his post up game is so much better.

It leaves Ferg on the bench (hopefully), and Abrines sees less minutes. We've got a decent amount of defense (moreso in the frontcourt).

Injuries for anyone left on the market are going to be a thing. So my question is stand pat or get some guys to help us make a run. Do you think it's enough tho?","Would you buy out Dakari to sign a SG + a C?

"We could get him for extremely cheap. The FA market is garbage right now. He can play SG, we literally have rookies starting at the 2 right now so we cant say that its not an improvement. 

He wants to play for a contender and knows this might be his last shot. He's gonna play as well as hes able to. He can also play with the bench and be competent. Our bench guys just seem scared 75% of the time but I can tell you D rose will shoot that shit unafraid. 

I think hes the best thing we can get right now unless Tony Allen get 4 years younger and is no longer recovering from a broken leg. 

We also wouldnt have to deal with Rose next year if it doesnt work out, but I think its definitely worth a shot considering the massive hole at the 2 now.

"Hi All,

Hope you don’t mind me posting here and if it needs moving somewhere else then mods, please feel free. 

I’m a Huge Thunder fan from the UK and have been toying with the idea of making a pilgrimage to the Peake with my sister who lives in Colorado. Ive decided if I’m going to do it then this may well be the best season to do so as I don’t know how long we can keep the band together! 

I thought about coming over during the regular season but figured if I’m gonna make the trip I want to experience loud city at its loudest, 

PLAYOFFS BABY!!!

Problem is I have absolutely no idea how ticketing for the playoffs works! And if I’m going to have enough time to organise a trip once the playoff schedule has been released (date?) I Especially don’t know how the ticketing allocation works for international Thunder fans (although I can use my sisters US address if I need to) 

I wondered if anyone would be able to give me any insight into how I can make this possible. If anyone can help make this dream a reality then let me know and there’ll be a limitless (within reason) supply of beer on game night for you!

 Seriously though I’d love to come and see the Thunder and if possible grab a beer with some resident Oklahomans. 

Also any other cool places to see/go/eat/drink in OKC whilst I’m there would be much appreciated! Keep up the good work guys.

Non contact injury.

I hope he is ok, but with him gone let's hope the Thunder capitalize and move  up the standings over the next 2 weeks.

Edit: too soon?  It's not gloating fellas.  It's just facts. 

When Russ got hurt, you think opposing coaches waited a week to start planning how to exploit the thunder?

Houston isn't happy he's hurt, but they are feasting on the wolves at the moment, and with a vengeance.

I'm not happy dude got hurt, but the reality is what it is.  Their loss should be our gain.  That's all I'm saying.

Edit #2: the replies to this post have interested me.  

Half of you guys say too soon, half are just absorbing it as news.

I think these are situations that show how we as fans view the game so much differently than those who directly participate in the NBA.

I'm thinking of when we lost Robes recently.  It shook us to the core, and you could tell that it threw OKC into chaos.  Detroit and their fans were shaken up too.

But as soon as he was off the floor, they tried to beat us.  They are first and foremost competitors, and they were willing to exploit any advantage given to them.

You don't have to be happy that butler was hurt.  I'm not.  He's a great player. 

I want the Thunder to dominate a healthy wolves squad.  But if they are down a player, I want the Thunder to dominate a depleted wolves squad.

Like Russ says, the only friend on a court is the basketball.","Jimmy butler just hurt his knee Had to be carried out of the game.

Non contact injury.

I hope he is ok, but with him gone let's hope the Thunder capitalize and move  up the standings over the next 2 weeks.

Edit: too soon?  It's not gloating fellas.  It's just facts. 

When Russ got hurt, you think opposing coaches waited a week to start planning how to exploit the thunder?

Houston isn't happy he's hurt, but they are feasting on the wolves at the moment, and with a vengeance.

I'm not happy dude got hurt, but the reality is what it is.  Their loss should be our gain.  That's all I'm saying.

Edit #2: the replies to this post have interested me.

"If it doesnt happen, ill bet its been explored or will be.

Pop can get the most out of melo and can likely develop ferguson to the point where this might eventually turn the trade SA's favor, especially if kawhi is on the downside because of injury, but ridding of melo might be worth it.

Man that would be a monster defense with pg, kawhi, and adams, and next year robes. and because of a higher fg% kawhi should be first option on offense if healthy. Sacrificing a little bit of future for dominance now though.

The downside... maybe pop wouldnt trade kawhi to the west. What do you do with both Gay and Melo (well they can switch with each other between sf and pf) and put la at center for a small ball lineup. Most of all, the spurs wouldnt be tanking but they would probably be giving up a chance for the championship until melo is aged out or gone. I dont know if thats in pops dna, but having melo and ferguson and assets is better than kawhi not playing, and alot of espn people say that relationship is fraying. 

If i was  presti i would roll the dice on kawhis health, considering he is actually cleared to play this year but chooses not to. Maybe a move to okc will change his mind. Salary cap and the tax are gonna be huge for okc but it was already that way next year for them, and could they keep both pg and kawhi, and also adams 25m also. Tax bill over 200m.

I guess there's no way to tell and he also says it's more so mental, so probably not. It would be interesting though.

"we have 3 days of nothingness. let's debate.

Let me first start off by saying I still think PG will give us a 1+1 --> there's no real rush to get to LA right now, they'll have most of that cap space next year. i also think if he sees LBJ give the cavs another chance, he may give OKC one. again, Lonzo/BI are really talented guys but they're not ready now. we could get into a convo about whether or not PG wants to win or not, but I think he was a lot upset in Indiana cuz they weren't winning and they pretty much took everything away from him that won.

Worst case scenario: Pg + Melo opt out -> Melo does it because he realizes he's not worth the money and decides to go ring chasing to a place with money/better team available.

Basically leaves us with another MVP Russ season, but I think we have way better pieces esp if Melo frees up enough money to bring Grant/Huestis/Felton back.

"So many ""lol stop being so reactionary"" posts/comments, but, although this sub has overreacted to many things earlier on, this is not one of those times. 

&nbsp;

* The Thunder bench is a very serious problem. It is not good by any metric. Terrance Ferguson is not ready. Huestis isn't ready. Alex Abrines *should* be exactly what OKC needs, and maybe post-ASB, he'll find his rhythm again. But it's hard to bank on that, and none of these players shows serious signs of major growth.

&nbsp;


* OKC has lost 6 of their last 9, and nearly blew a 22 point lead to one of the worst teams in basketball last night. The Thunder are currently tied in standings with LAC (5-1 since the trade) in the loss column for the 9th seed (with the Jazz on an 11 game winning streak at 10th).

&nbsp;



* OKC has lost a DPOY starting SG, and cannot replace his impact. Our sample size with him out both before his first injury, and after his last one, is very telling. OKC plays very poorly without Roberson, and he was very key in wins against teams like GS/HOU. Replicating the win we recently had against GS will be hard to do without Robes in a 7 game series. 

&nbsp;



* *Kyle Wagner from FiveThirtyEight writes:* ""Since Roberson went out, Oklahoma City’s defensive rating has been 112.3, **which would rank 27th in the league**, ahead of only the Cleveland Cavaliers, Sacramento Kings and Phoenix Suns.""

&nbsp;

* No one was buying what Presti was selling at the deadline, and that's not good. He's an excellent GM, and his track record shows that. If he held on to Ferguson in hopes of him being a good player 3 years down the line, I think that's a mistake, but we don't know *what* happened, and there's nothing that can be done now. The Thunder needed a big off the bench and bench scoring *before* Roberson went down. A trade allows opportunity to receive multiple players, and with essentially one season left with Huestis and Grant (due to money they'll get and our cap issues nest season), it would have been great to ""exchange"" rentals for better ones. (I'll note that Grant looks great right now, though his BPM is not great).

&nbsp;


* We have 1 open roster spot that likely belongs to Tony Allen. Sam Presti hasn't been known for buying out players. Ideally, a Tony Allen/Bogut/? pickup on the market could help plug holes, but again, we have one slot.

&nbsp;



**Now look**. I'm (probably dangerously) obsessed with this team, more than most of my hobbies. It's probably unhealthy, the amount of research I do on them and how closely I follow the NBA. I am ride-or-die with OKC. But you/me/we HAVE to be realistic. This season is *massively* important and many insiders **really** believe that PG will re-sign with a successful playoff run. 
But these circumstances the Thunder finds themselves in now, they're different than earlier on. This season is different because it has massive implications on the next 5 years of this franchise. The path forward before was ""give them time."" The path forward now is ""change...something.""

&nbsp;

**IT DOES NOT MAKE YOU A ""BAD FAN"" OR A BANDWAGONER TO ACKNOWLEDGE THESE THINGS.** It makes you a fan with awareness. That does not mean we can't be hopeful.

&nbsp;

*I think the ASB will be great for the Thunder. I think rotations will be tuned, I think Presti will be active in the buyout market, and I think a permanent lineup shuffle will be in the works. I think (hot take) that Melo off the bench will be a conversation that will be had internally.*

&nbsp;


**TL:DR;** I think good things are ahead of the OKC Thunder post-All Star Break, but they're not guaranteed, and things are not good right now. And that's perfectly ok to be aware of. There's a line between over-reacting and under-reacting.

"Ever since Roberson went out our boys have clearly had some growing pains. Specifically, our defense has struggled to adapt. Simply replacing Roberson with Abrines or TFerg in the starting lineup has yet to work. Starting Huestis seemed to help but he struggles on the offensive end. My question is why haven't we attempted to start Jerami or at least give him more playing time? He always seems to be very effective in his limited minutes, providing a spark and holding his own on defense. Starting him would also allow us to slide PG to the 2 to fill Roberson's spot.

"So the new Cavs are no joke. This might be a bit established by now, but OKC's issues don't majorly lie on the starters but rather the bench. If Melo is only getting around 15 points, Russ and PG can step in and get around 25 each.

But you can't rely on just starters and the fact that Adams just played 41 minutes against the Cavs is a testament of this, the bench is where most inconsistency lasts because the only consistent bench player (and you might disagree) is **Grant**. Abrines had an amazing game against the Grizzlies but it seems as if Billy D will have to switch the starting SG every game because they can't seem to contribute enough offence-wise on a day-to-day basis. 

Felton had a good run during the winning streaks and he is still decent but when 3 other bench players who all get more than 10 minutes of playing time get 0 points and as a collective get the same amount of rebounds as Westbrook (sorry this is a bit irrelevant) it makes you wonder.

Edit: Another Grizzlies game, maybe Melo and Russ can have an easier re-integration game against them before ASW Thunder Up!","Random rant: The Bench needs some milk So the new Cavs are no joke. This might be a bit established by now, but OKC's issues don't majorly lie on the starters but rather the bench. If Melo is only getting around 15 points, Russ and PG can step in and get around 25 each.

But you can't rely on just starters and the fact that Adams just played 41 minutes against the Cavs is a testament of this, the bench is where most inconsistency lasts because the only consistent bench player (and you might disagree) is **Grant**. Abrines had an amazing game against the Grizzlies but it seems as if Billy D will have to switch the starting SG every game because they can't seem to contribute enough offence-wise on a day-to-day basis.

"I'll be honest and say that I've always been more so a fan of players rather than teams. So Russ was the initial pull to watching OKC, but that quickly changed. I saw a team with an immense amount of talent, but my love for the team grew even more after KD's departure. 

I saw them as the underdogs. A team that stuck together through adversity and a group of guys fighting to prove the naysayers wrong. A locker room with grit, passion and heart. Guys that came out there and sacrificed their bodies every night regardless of the narrative that Russ was carrying the team on his back. I saw guys with incredible work ethic and toughness.

I've also realized that I'm drawn to defense. While everyone else would oh and ah at a guy splashing a 3 pointer, I get more excited over a block or steal. I just admire the effort and discipline it takes for a team to be great on that side of the ball. 

I've never had an appreciation for an entire roster the way I do with OKC. I obviously have my favorites in Russ, Dre and Steve. I like to call them the OGs of the team.

"Any skills or qualities that you feel the players don't get recognized enough for or isn't talked about at all. 

Russ: His leadership role. It says a lot when a guy can come out on the court and control the entire tempo of a team. The team usually feeds off his energy. If he's having an exceptional night on the court, his teammates will usually elevate their game (very obvious in those GSW games this season). 

Dre: His dunks. Im a chick, so I'll never be able to dunk and I'm extremely jealous. Lol They're just pretty dunks, I don't know how else to describe them. Lol He goes up effortlessly and they usually have a bit of finesse to them. I'll also add his aggression and physical strength. People know he's a great defensive player, but I don't think the amount of physical strength he displays gets highlighted enough. This strength becomes apparent when he has to defend players with very athletic body types like Kawhi, Lebron and Giannis (can y'all tell I really like Dre, lol). 

Steve-O: His basketball IQ. I just think he has great awareness out on the court and plays off his teammates very well. I really try to pay attention to what guys are doing when the ball is not in their hands(setting screens, etc). People talk a lot about his chemistry with Russ and it's great, but his chemistry with Dre is also on another level. In past games, I usually notice them communicating the most. They're both the defensive anchors for the team and if anything he should be praised for his defensive efforts just as much as Dre is.

PG13: That man got some handles though! Lol I feel like his ball handling skills don't get talked about very much. I know some fans have beeen saying for years that he's just an underrated player in general. I think he gets his props though, I've heard a lot of people  (including commentators) mention he's one of the best 2 way players in the league.

"First off, we were without 3/5 of our starters.  The reigning MVP, Carmelo Anthony and a player who was on pace to compete for dpoy.  Stop saying we would have won if we would have made a trade, we wouldn’t have.  The lakers aren’t a bunch of scrubs.   Our bench may be weak, but any team that loses 3 starters isn’t going to be very competitive in today’s NBA.  
Secondly, as far as PG goes, who cares?  Literally nothing we post on here matters to him.  If he already has his decision made, then so be it.  If he doesn’t have his decision made, then let him have the year.  It wasn’t his choice to play here.  He does not owe us anything.  Enjoy him while he’s here.  If he leaves, then we will have a hell of a lot of cap space to work with this off season.

"The Thunder didn’t make a trade. So what! Who do you think they could’ve gotten for guys like Grant, Huestis, and Abrines? It was obvious they don’t want to get rid of Ferguson. There’s no doubt in my mind that Presti was very busy during the last week. Trying to get Hood, Evans, Bradley, or Smart. But what the Thunder could offer wasn’t good enough. I’m glad that he didn’t just make a trade to make one. Evans is likely to get bought out so he should be the number 1 target. If they don’t get him Belinelli is also very likely to be bought out. He could add some good consistent outside shooting that they need and keep Huestis in the starting line up for athleticism and defense. And if all else fails pick up Tony Allen for the defense but he shouldn’t be number 1 priority. I still believe George will resign as I think it’s his best option if he wants to win now.

"Please guys hear me out before downvoting this as nonsense.

The Thunder are high off a blowout win against the Warriors and  replacing Ferg with Heustis in the starting lineup was a very large part of that.  Losing Roberson sucks but seeing that WB/PG/Heustis/Melo/Adams lineup and especially that WB/PG/Heustis/Grant/Adams lineup made me realize you guys have found your answer.  Let me explain.

Remember that thread I made a couple of months ago explaining how the Thunder's defense was built for the Warrior's offense?

Thunder lead the league in causing turnovers.  Warriors are top 5 in turnovers per game.

However, it was the cumulative collection of Russ/Roberson/PG/ and Adams that made the defense special.  PG had a defensive wing running mate with Roberson and Westbrook is a pest with quick hands and Adams is a mountain. 

Then Roberson got injured and the mistake that your coach made was replacing him with T-Ferg.  T-Ferg has unknown potential but his effort cannot be questioned.  Sadly like most rookies, his defense is terrible.  As a result, PG became overworked on the perimeter, Russ and Melo get exploited on defense, and Adams is also overworked.  The culmination of this was represented by the statistical fact that your team had the worst defensive rating in the league without Roberson.  Not starting the ""appropriate"" substitute for Roberson was the problem.

From what I have seen, Heustis should have been in the starting lineup from the beginning.  I believe another poster said Heustis was a Roberson lite in terms of defense and I agree.  Heustis played lock down D on Beal and now Klay Thompson and I don't think that's an anomaly.  He made guarding Klay Thompson off ball look easy.  

Now that PG has found a defensive running mate, the Thunder can now emulate the defense they were playing before and get close enough to that defense to go on that tear they were on before.

I think the WB/PG/Heustis/Melo/Adams lineup is the way to go for the rest of the season.  We are starting to see just how good (great actually) Heustis is defensively  and now is the time to build his confidence going into the playoffs. 

I am still concerned about the issues your team failed to address via trade, but, your team killed other teams despite these issues because of their elite defense as well WB, Melo, and PG figuring it out together.  

I really like the WB/PG/Heustis/Melo/Adams lineup and this lineup along with your other defenders will give you guys a chance for a deep playoff run without Roberson.  

TLDR; Losing Roberson fucked up your defense-->Starting Ferg was not the answer-->Starting Heustis is the answer because  the starting lineup of WB/PG/Heustis/Melo/Adams is close enough defensively to the WB/Roberson/PG/Melo/Adams for your team to dominate again.

Singler - 4.996



Ferguson - 2.11884m


Johnson - 1.378242m

OKC could also add picks + cash to the deal. Singler is the only bad contract there but he's an expiring deal so it wouldn't be too difficult to take the last year of his deal on.

"I posted this in a comment, but anyways I wrote way too much for this to be a comment and just have some thoughts on the whole PG situation.


Right now, the ball is in the thunders court. How well the playoffs go determine if he leaves or stays. If we perform poorly, this is all some failed experiment. If we win, OKC is a significantly more attractive destination for PG. Here’s why.


A. Sam Presti. Magic Johnson is an unproven GM. Meanwhile Presti has been a premier GM in the league for awhile now. By staying in OKC, PG will always be in a position to win no matter what.


B. Russ. Russ has shown(despite what the horseshit media wants you to believe) that he is a great leader. Most former and current players on the thunder love him. First off, he consistently stands up for his teammates. Secondly, and more importantly, he always puts blame on his own shoulders and no else’s. Even when he was the only goof player against the rockets last year, he interrupted a reporter who tried to ask Steve-O about every one else’s shitty opinions. No way I see any other player do that.


C. Drama. While Russ goes out on a limb to protect his teammates constantly, Lebron willingly calls out his teammates in the media and constantly has beef with someone in his own organization. I’m a Lebron fan, but it’s undeniable the dudes always got something going on. First he has a problem with David Blatt and gets him fired, replaced him with a puppet in Ty Lue, and now apparently Lue’s on the Hot seat. Rumors are always floating around that he and K Love have beef. He’s got such bad problems with Kyrie that it factored into Kyrie’s trade request(remember folks, kyrie didn’t just leave in free agency, he ASKED to get traded). Now there’s locker room drama with IT. He’s reported as having recently yelled at two team executives. He’s bitched about his teammates in the past, publicly. The list goes on and on. Now throw LaVar Ball into the mix. This guy has publicly criticized Luke Walton to the media. He distracts from basketball and creates problem. Compare it all to the stable locker room of the thunder and the strong leadership of Russ. PG needs to take this into consideration.


D. Adams/Roberson. The lakers have yet to prove that its roster is composed of winners. Sure, they have potential, but no one really knows what these guys can do and when they’re gonna do it. Hell, we don’t even know if Lonzo will ever learn to shoot properly. If PG is trying to win a championship, this team is not on his timeline. Meanwhile the thunder have two young players that are known commodities who have proved they can contribute. Adams is pretty much an all star now. He consistently scores 20 a game on incredible efficiency, is strong as all hell, sets monster screens and is a defensive force. On top of that all he is one of the best rebounders in the league, and unequivocally the best offensive rebounder(additionally, I think Stevens stats severely underrepresent how good of a rebounder he is. On the defensive end, russ and pg typically get the boards because it ignites our insane transition offense. But all that comes from Steve-O’s boxing out. If it wasn’t for this I see Stephen easily being a top 3 rebounder in the league). Now let’s look at Dre. The best defender in the league. Only Kawhi and that donkey looking dude on Golden State are on his level. He also sets screens, grabs boards and has all around incredible hustle. So, if PG signs with us, that guarantees we have a line up with not just 4 solid starters, but 4 elite ones. Even if Lebron signs with LA, that’s still just a roster of a bunch of kids and two all stars. And that ain’t shit. Everybody has two at least two all stars these days. I don’t see LA competing with Golden state, but we sure as fuck can.

E. Billy D. Now I know we all have complaints about him from time to time, myself included, but Billy D is a good coach, and those don't just grow on trees. In my opinion, in the current NBA landscape, a good coach and system is 100% necessary to win. Pretty much all other contenders have good coaches(except cleveland, but there a fucking mess anyways). The team with the best players doesn't always win, but the team that takes those players and creates a system that is better than their opponents. Billy D is actually great at making a system and getting players to accept their roles. When all of our players were healthy and our system was pretty much unstoppable, going on a 9 game tear. And sure, when dre, the central piece of our defensive system was injured, we went a bit off the rails for a bit but came out of it at the end blowing up the warriors. Billy is able to coach great defense and get all of his players to accept their roles. For years, Melo was criticized as a ball hog who played no defense and didn't put in enough effort at the boards. Half way through this season, he comes out saying he's accepted his role and is much more happy as a third option. Adams is willing to give up a shit ton of rebounds(which, btw, would greatly increase his value and land him a lucrative contract down the line) so that russ can get them and ignite the fast break. In the past two months, Russ has cut down heavily on dumb shots and stupid 3s. Billy is clearly a capable coach that can get his players to buy into a winning system. Meanwhile, Lavar is going around saying the Lakers don't want to play for Luke Walton, who almost got fired earlier on in the year. And sure, if the lakers get Lebron and PG they could fire Walton and find someone new, but its not like coaches just grow on trees, especially when you have Lebron's ego in the room, so PG has to take that into account.

Despite everything I just said, the thunder still need to perform in the play offs to keep PG. In Russ we Trust.","Regarding PG, the ball is in the Thunder's court I posted this in a comment, but anyways I wrote way too much for this to be a comment and just have some thoughts on the whole PG situation.

Hell, we don’t even know if Lonzo will ever learn to shoot properly. If PG is trying to win a championship, this team is not on his timeline. Meanwhile the thunder have two young players that are known commodities who have proved they can contribute. Adams is pretty much an all star now. He consistently scores 20 a game on incredible efficiency, is strong as all hell, sets monster screens and is a defensive force. On top of that all he is one of the best rebounders in the league, and unequivocally the best offensive rebounder(additionally, I think Stevens stats severely underrepresent how good of a rebounder he is. On the defensive end, russ and pg typically get the boards because it ignites our insane transition offense. But all that comes from Steve-O’s boxing out. If it wasn’t for this I see Stephen easily being a top 3 rebounder in the league). Now let’s look at Dre. The best defender in the league. Only Kawhi and that donkey looking dude on Golden State are on his level. He also sets screens, grabs boards and has all around incredible hustle. So, if PG signs with us, that guarantees we have a line up with not just 4 solid starters, but 4 elite ones. Even if Lebron signs with LA, that’s still just a roster of a bunch of kids and two all stars. And that ain’t shit. Everybody has two at least two all stars these days. I don’t see LA competing with Golden state, but we sure as fuck can.

E. Billy D. Now I know we all have complaints about him from time to time, myself included, but Billy D is a good coach, and those don't just grow on trees. In my opinion, in the current NBA landscape, a good coach and system is 100% necessary to win. Pretty much all other contenders have good coaches(except cleveland, but there a fucking mess anyways). The team with the best players doesn't always win, but the team that takes those players and creates a system that is better than their opponents. Billy D is actually great at making a system and getting players to accept their roles. When all of our players were healthy and our system was pretty much unstoppable, going on a 9 game tear. And sure, when dre, the central piece of our defensive system was injured, we went a bit off the rails for a bit but came out of it at the end blowing up the warriors. Billy is able to coach great defense and get all of his players to accept their roles. For years, Melo was criticized as a ball hog who played no defense and didn't put in enough effort at the boards. Half way through this season, he comes out saying he's accepted his role and is much more happy as a third option. Adams is willing to give up a shit ton of rebounds(which, btw, would greatly increase his value and land him a lucrative contract down the line) so that russ can get them and ignite the fast break. In the past two months, Russ has cut down heavily on dumb shots and stupid 3s. Billy is clearly a capable coach that can get his players to buy into a winning system. Meanwhile, Lavar is going around saying the Lakers don't want to play for Luke Walton, who almost got fired earlier on in the year. And sure, if the lakers get Lebron and PG they could fire Walton and find someone new, but its not like coaches just grow on trees, especially when you have Lebron's ego in the room, so PG has to take that into account.

Despite everything I just said, the thunder still need to perform in the play offs to keep PG. In Russ we Trust.",6,15,"Regarding PG, the ball is in the Thunder's court",https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/7w7acf/regarding_pg_the_ball_is_in_the_thunders_court/

"This may be reactionary to both last night and the Breakaway podcast on Roberson but I *don’t* want the Thunder to make a trade and here are my reasons why.

1. **Chemistry:** Most Thunder fans would admit that our culture isn’t necessarily the easiest to fit into. Even though guys enjoy Russ as a person and competitor he doesn’t give his trust too willingly and I worry that guys who don’t match his expectations would be swallowed up in his wake. Even Billy D has been prone to that at times. Regardless the chemistry is starting to click and adding another piece this late would be a tough change to re-calibrate to. I think the fact that they have looked so good at times in this “year one” is largely due to Melo and it would be a lot to trust him to bring another guy in while it would most likely limit his own opportunities further.
2. **Value:** Our two most likely traded contracts, in my opinion, are Abrines and Singler, and both of those guys would be expirings next year and may be *worth* the second rounder that it would cost to move them now (more so in Singler’s case). They would at least function as some sort of trade exception to take on a midsized contract that runs longer.
4. **Long View:** On the Breakaway podcast Rob Mahone noted how playing without Roberson was something of an inevitability, due to playoff gameplans/ Hack-a-Robes. While I disagree to an extent it is true that the internal development opportunities this gives to Ferg, Abrines and even Roberson to an extent could be much more valuable than a few seed lines this year. (I didn’t include Grant and Huestis because their contracts are up this year.) TFerg has been rather awful so far but if the coaching staff can see improvement from the reps it could lead to a much better and confident second season or second half of this one.

I hold only a few exceptions to this and a one year, even a two year (Courtney Lee), rental to push for a championship is *not* one of them.

1. **Flexibility:** Earlier I mentioned the futures of Grant and Huestis and if there is a trade that changes in a big way their ability to retain those guys I would deem it worth it. Basically, if Singler's 5mil needs to be moved to reduce the tax and make the ownership comfortable to resign those guys if something above the minimum is needed (a certainty for Grant.)
2. **Convince PG:** This angle seems to have quieted after the Rachel Nichols interview and everyone seems to think a PG one-and-one is a likelihood now. But I remember a certain other superstar who I was sure would go that route and didn’t, I’m sure Presti does too. I hope this isn’t the main rationale for doing a deal because that would most likely mean it isn’t a good one and would probably have the opposite effect but it is a very real motivation.
3. **The Lou Williams Extension:** After seeing the Lou Will 8mil a year extension it may make sense to trade for an impending restricted free agent and play the game with them. I understand that Lou is 31 and the market will be different for a younger guy but with limited cap space this summer you could get a steal if you play your cards right.

Would love to hear your guys’ thoughts, I’ve been wanting a trade for weeks and now I am anxious that one would only make things worse.

**TL;DR:** I don't want the Thunder to make a trade unless it is for next season and beyond, not this one.

"The last few days for our heroes had been tough.  Their spirits had been broken and battered from a series of events and they felt as though they'd never reach their goals.  They traveled to the Dwarven Hold only to fall short from retrieving the nugget the Wizards told them about.  The dwarfs were too strong and held our heroes off from entering.  On the way home, a flock of birds mercilessly attacked our heroes and left them tired and bloody.  The pelicans too showed no mercy when pecking at the men, taking chunks away from their flesh and bruising their minds.  Our heroes managed to flee home, battered.  However, once they reached the safe haven of Castle Chesapeake, an annoying group of yellow shirts were there to greet them and make fools of Sir Brook and his men. The Yellow Shirts were really what did them in.  After their leader, King Kobe the Tyrant, retired to his own private estate, the group of Yellow Shirts were still riding the high of the fear they instilled in people across the land.  The truth is, they were no more scary than a group of mosquitoes.  However, every once in a while, a swarm of bloodsuckers prevail, and unfortunately, that was their time.  

Our heroes were nothing short of stunned at their outcome of events.

Sir Brook was the type of man that didn't take kindly to failure.  He understood it was a necessity, but so is death, and just as he hated the old friend that had taken lives of his kin before, he hated failure just as much.  For failure can be overcome. 

But to know true hate, you must also truly love that which you despise.

-break-

The morning following the onslaught of the Yellow Shirts, Saint PG, 13th of his name, Sir Melo the Hooded, and Squire Kiwi sat at the breakfast table, merely poking around at their food.  

“We are nothing without Andre, Son of Robes, our brother.” Squire Kiwi Said. 

“Bah” Sir Melo speaks.  “He is a great man, and shall recover soon.  We shan't be mourning the loss of a man who isn't gone.”

Squire Kiwi looks at his plate, head hung low. “Aye, but without him, I feel a hole in us.  His lack of presence is felt and we are unable to take care of ourselves...We fight like mere children!” 

“Adversity is great, Squire Kiwi"" Westbrook said, walking through the doorway to the breakfast nook. ""Me personally, I love adversity. It gives us, as a team of champions, an opportunity to become closer, bring every man together and look forward to positive things. Throughout our lives, there's going to be a lot of ups and downs, however, we must never flinch. That's one thing about this kingdom, about our men, and about us: We never flinch. We always stand together.""

Squire Kiwi looks up. His look of despair disappeared and a glimmer of hope shined in his eyes.  

“Gather your things men.  We have a trip we need to take.” Sir Brook says.

And gather they did!  With Raymond the Thicc carrying the packs, our men march with new confidence.  Sir Brook managed to increase his party with a few fighters from the area as well.  A few young men with various skills of their own, Sir Brook feels they will be an asset to their journey.

“I never asked where we were traveling to” Sir Melo asks Sir Brook.

“Well Sir Melo, if I told you, how would we keep the readers in suspense?”  Sir Brook responds.

“If I recall...this is just a recap of an event that already happened.”  St PG says as he looks at both the men. “By the way, Sir Melo, you may want to take care of that ankle.  It may be sore in the morn.”

After a few days travel, our men approach an area in the west.  Golden Gates separate our heroes from the coast.  Behind the gates, lay a city paved with gold.  This is land men travel to when they need to rest.

“Oracle.”  Sir Brooke of West says.  “Men...with all that has happened...with the downfalls and short comings, I believe the Gods are with us.  I have faith in what we are as a unit, and as individuals.  The barbarians that are the Warriors have yet to face what we have.  With that, I've brought you with me here... as teachers, to take these boys to school.”

Our heroes overlook Oracle.  Silence overcomes the group.  They feel an energy among them.  With racing hearts, weak knees, sweaty palms and mother's pasta, Squire Kiwi raises his fist to the air and shouts.  The rest of the men follow suit, slamming their arms to their shields.  Sir Brook paces back and forth yelling vigorously.  As the look on, they see flags waving over the horizon.  A team of Warriors run towards our heroes with swords pointed onward. 

“Ready men!”  Sir Brook shouts.  “Keep your focus!  Today is our day!”

“How will we beat them?” Kyle Singler the Singing Bard asks.

Sir Brook turns towards him, with a wry smile of excitement and hatred.  He speaks “...how do we defeat them?...you tell me.”  

Sir Brook draws his weapon, and with the speed of a champion horse, runs towards the Warriors.

“you fight every battle the same way.” Kyle says...

The group of men sprint behind Sir Brook and begin fighting their battle as they've never fought before. 

-break-

It is unclear how we got here.  The fire that fuels these two groups of men is undeniable.  They have a disdain for each other that burns with a thousand suns and every time they meet, it seems as though the universe around them implodes on itself.  The clash of their swords can be heard from towns away.  The tension can be felt around the kingdoms.  Despite fighting other men, their ultimate goal is always to destroy the other.  

Rumors have it, the tensions between the groups arose when a man that calls himself “The Snake” decided to wander alone.  He once fought beside Sir Brook.  They were a duo set to conquer the world.  However, one day in the middle of Summer, The Snake decided he had enough.  He found himself traveling for days on end until he reached a town on the coast.  With warm welcomes, and showers of gold, the Town of Oracle promised him everything he had always wanted....and they delivered.  He was a great man that had succumbed to the poison of greed.  He remember not of where he came from, nor how he got there.  He only remembers himself...

Sir Brook is a man of humility.  He feels life should be lived, not handed on a platter.  The treachery from losing his right hand man struck him worse than most wounds he has faced in the past...second to death...He understands that death can be forgiven.  Memories of loved ones stay with a man forever.  Greater men take those memories with themselves on their drive for greatness...

But treachery...

Treachery can never be forgiven.

The swords of our heroes clash with those of the Warriors.  The smell of metal fills the air as sparks fly from the impact.  Shields are collapsing under the pressure of intense combat leaving both sides exposed.  This fight is not for the feint of heart.  These men are fighting for life and death. 

After hours of blood soaked wounds, kicks, punches, and the clamoring of arms, the Warriors waive their flag of defeat.  Their men lay on the battlefield, exhausted and bloodied.  Our men, too, are short of breath, gasping for air, sore and tired.  Sir Brook of West kneels, resting on the hilt of his sword of The Snake.  

“You were my brother...” Sir Brook says to The Snake. “You were my family...”

The Snake, clenching his stomach, looks back at Sir Brook.  “...I still have love in my heart for you...but...you must understand...”

“I do understand.” he responds. “I understand that greed bested you.  When I needed you the most, you refused to extend your hand.  When Castle Chesapeake was at it's worst, you turned your back.  When the pressure was on us, to take us to the top...you ran like the coward you are...”

“It's not like that....” The Snake winces.  

Sir Brook stands, and looks down at the snake.  “You mean nothing more to me than a cupped cake, Snake...now slither back to your hole with the rest of your worms...”

Sir Brook points at his men.  “Men! Gather your things.  Bard!  Play us out!”

Kyle Singler the Singing Bard unsheathes his instrument and begins to play the song of our [men](https://youtu.be/VGcsYEODJNg?t=29) as the final blow to the warriors.  Our men gather, and begin to head south toward the land of lakes where King Kobe the Tyrant once reigned.

"Hi guys. Two things.


One: Watching you guys thrash the Dubs last night was the only comfort I could find after Zinger went down. I've been pulling for you guys all year regardless because of the Melo connection but now I am really putting all my emotional eggs in the Thunder's basket. Please. For the love of God please give Knicks fans **something** to enjoy this year as we live  vicariously thru Melo and thru Thunder fans.

Now, onto the main thing - we are shopping Lee. What is the most you would be comfortable with giving up for him?

One: Watching you guys thrash the Dubs last night was the only comfort I could find after Zinger went down. I've been pulling for you guys all year regardless because of the Melo connection but now I am really putting all my emotional eggs in the Thunder's basket. Please. For the love of God please give Knicks fans **something** to enjoy this year as we live  vicariously thru Melo and thru Thunder fans.

Now, onto the main thing - we are shopping Lee. What is the most you would be comfortable with giving up for him?

"Let me preface this by saying that I like Melo. I think in several ways he has made an honest attempt to fit in and I've seen him make several extra passes. And I think for this team to be as dangerous as possible in the playoffs, Melo has to be involved. He can't just be an afterthought. He was a big part of why we won eight straight games. 

However, it seems like the last few games he has went back to old habits. He's been calling for a lot more post ups and has taken some bad contested jumpers. It also feel like he is missing a lot of open threes. He is 43/126 over the last nine games. He is now shooting 41/35/77 splits on the heat. 

Last night, he missed all four shots he took before leaving the game, which included two straight bad postups against draymond fucking green. I really do think we need Melo to beat the warriors in a series, but he's gotta know that he has to play within the flow of the offense for him to be helpful.

Anybody seeing this lately or am I just being too hard on him?

"Hi there from Australia :)

I have watched nba only once playoffs started, got into NBA just a week before Christmas. I am getting used to the how the league works with free agency, trades etc (I am an avid football -soccer to most Americans and yeah in European competitions no such thing as salary cap, draft existing) also starting to get used to the competition however this will take me a long long time but that’s all good :)
Decided to go for Thunder because blue is my favourite colour and yeah Russ is perfect. 

Was looking at past players we had and seen harden played for us and so did KD (his probably easier to understand, chased a ring and personally I do not blame him) sorry if that last part angered anyone but winning the ring is do all for probably 99% of players instead of becoming the city’s legend. 

Why did Harden and KD leave IF the reason for KD was not due to success, was it simply salary?

Can someone also tell me how this free agency shit works, how come we have a chance of losing PG when we just signed him. From a soccer fan no club in the world and I mean no club would sign a player for a 1 season contract unless the player is 32+ years old. Contracts are generally 3-5 years long. Did PG only sign a 1 year deal or is this the free agency thing that I will slowly learn and understand and that a contract means nothing or something?

"Adams is better than DJ. Yes. Adams is younger than DJ. Adams and Russ chemistry is amazing. All the yes.

Here's the problem. If we want to get better, we don't have many assets. If a package that includes, say Adams and Ferg get you DJ and Lou, and we can still get another wing (Hood or Joe Johnson) and/or even a center in Dedmon, doesn't that kind of make this team deeper?

DJ can do about 70-85% of what Adams does. I don't like DJ cuz he can't pass and he doesn't have a back to the basket game, but is it 100% necessary in this offense? We need rebounding and someone to catch the lob.

You guys have been salivating over Lou Williams.

And here's the thing. DJ can either opt out or we can extend him (ideally for cheaper per year). Imagine if we can do that with he and Melo,pay less and have a team competitive against the top teams in the West when Robes returns. Imagine being able to put together a solid team that can still compete the remainder of this year so we can keep PG.

We loved Kanter and were excited about Dipo, but we traded them and in turn got really good guys and convinced Russ to extend. What if these help keep PG and get Melo to renegotiate his deal to stay and ring chase?

Idk. Maybe I'm just convincing myself.

"Bulls fan here, who lurks around here sometimes bc Russ is my favorite player

Not to be that guy but guys....some of you are taking things for granted

After every loss i notice so many of your fans just straight shitting on the team, players, and some even saying they’re done with this team

You guys have had nothing but success the entire time this franchise has been a live. Theres teams that never even make the playoffs and fans still ride with their team and support no matter what. Dont take this the wrong way, but you guys have been spoiled with a lot of success in the last 10 years and the minute things go bad, some of you are out there giving up. It makes some of you look very weak and shows that you really dont know how it feels to be reeaaally bad and a constant lotto team year in year out. No appreciation

Seen my Bulls go thru so much, and definitely a lot of shitty times so when they’re having some success im there enjoying every minute of it regardless if things go bad during that time.

Appreciate what you have now, because it can be gone real soon. Dont give up. Remember that going thru the bad times, adversity, ups and downs, is what makes the reallly good times even sweeter as a fan. Dont be a fair weather fan, its just not a good look. 

Again, dont take this the wrong way, just my 2 cent and what ive noticed during November and now during this bad stretch. 

Remember that some fans would love and wish to be in your shoes and have such success year in and year out, dont take things for granted. 

That being said, good luck with the rest of your season.

"I've watched around 70% of thunder games this season (cause of Melo).  I know Terrance has put out around 2 or 3 phenomenal games (which is what you ask for from a rookie) which show a TON of future potential.  That said, *he's a rookie* and he's playing like a very green rookie (a ton of non-factor games and a good/great game here and there).

&nbsp;

Thunder (and its fans) need to decide if this is a year to just ""go for it"" with George and Melo out there along with Russell and Adams or to keep Fergusen, even if he only has 2 alright games, 1 awesome game, and a ton of nonfactor or bad games in a month.  

&nbsp;

Oquinn would shore up that backup C position which, imo, has looked pretty weak and risky with Patterson manning it.  PPat is a PF, not a C imo.  Lee would give you slightly above average defense and can shoot the ball damn well.  I truly believe these two players would help the team A LOT more over having Ferg and a combination of Huestis/Abrines out there.  Both are defensive players and both can shoot it.  Oquinn is a MASTERFUL passer too.

"This is definitely reactionary, but also seems pretty logical. Starters and bench are both terrible right now and I feel like this move would benefit both the team and players from this role change.

Patterson is a better, more active defender and natural fit with the starters offensively and defensively than Melo. Patterson moves the ball well, sets good screens, and hustles(something we need with Dre out). He would get more looks from 3 playing alongside Westbrook, which is another positive of this.

Another key part of this move and probably the biggest is that Melo would help the bench immensely, as the bench sorely lacks scoring and another offensive threat other than Felton. Melo could have a more important offensive role(6th man), other than spotting up 90% of the time and having the occasional post-up.

"Hi everyone. Knick fan here checking in.

Obviously with things that have transpired over the last few days, a number of scenarios have come up for potential replacements for Andre Roberson's defense production. ""Avery Bradley"", ""Marcus Smart"", ""Justice Winslow"" etc. To tell you the truth, OKC simply doesn't have the right assets or cap flexibility to acquire any of those players, so I'm interested in hearing your feedback on the possibility of Lance Thomas reuniting with the Thunder. Thunder management obviously still has a ton of respect for Lance Thomas for his short time there. He's respected by all teammates for being a consummate pro where ever he goes, for providing veteran leadership on and off the court, and for his defensive smarts and tenacity every game. He's also one of Carmelo's closest friends.

Those of you who haven't paid much attention to Thomas' play on the court in the last couple of years, allow me fill you in a little bit. Over the last few seasons, he is still very much relied on anchoring the Knicks' defense on the perimeter: preventing drives, providing effort on closeouts, and bringing invaluable help defense. At **6'8""** and **235 lbs** with terrific strength and lateral quickness, Thomas gives solid size to the perimeter, and is perfectly capable of switching onto positions 1-4 (ideal when facing a club full of ball-dominant shooters in the playoffs such as the Warriors). While Thomas may not be the slasher that Roberson is, he does bring an attribute that Roberson lacked: long-distance shooting. Ever since joining the Knicks, Thomas has indeed molded his game into the prototypical 3&D player, increasing his 3 point shot percentage wise and volume wise, shooting at a respectable **.409 3P%** over the last 3.5 seasons. With a low usage rate, Lance can still fill the hole in OKC's perimeter defense without the team sacrificing touches for the Big 3.

**Here are some intriguing stats and footage for you to review and consider:**

Season | Opponent FG% Differential
---|---
2014-15 (OKC/NYK)|Opponents shoot **-1.3 FG%** from league average when guarded by Lance Thomas
2015-16 (NYK)|Opponents shoot **-3.3 FG%** from league average when guarded by Lance Thomas
2016-17 (NYK)|Opponents shoot **-5.1 FG%** from league average when guarded by Lance Thomas
2017-18 (NYK)|Opponents shoot **-9.6 FG%** from league average when guarded by Lance Thomas

Footage 2: [Knicks Film School: Lance Thomas Defense vs Kemba Walker and Hornets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTLWLrIDkSk)

**TLDR:** OKC can acquire a defensive stopper in Lance Thomas to play along side Westbrook, George, Adams, and Anthony, **without** giving up an arm and a leg. The Knicks might even throw in O'Quinn if the package can net them a younger prospect and a 2nd rounder.","Lance Thomas - Cheap replacement for Andre Roberson? Hi everyone.

"Why does losing Andre have such an effect on how the entire team plays? The answer is losing Andre has a massive effect on how Russ plays, which in turn has repercussions for the entire team. Without Andre, Russ's defensive weaknesses are exploited. Andre's help defense isn't there when Russ loses his man, leaving shooters wide open on the perimeter and Adams is quite often having to cover this leaving the rim open inside. Without Andre, Russ is having to expel more energy on defense which means he has less energy on offense, so we're seeing Russ make stupid plays on the attack.

"Some Thunder fan over on r/nba insisted to me that Billy doesn't run any plays, which is not true. It's O.K. to not like Billy, but let's at least not like him for the right reasons. 

Anyhow, I have decided to show the wonderful users of r/Thunder the basic sets that Billy usually runs. To me, knowing the plays make the games more fun to watch, and it's interesting to see when Billy throws in a random set play that we haven't run yet. 

**NOTE:** This doesn't include High pick-and-rolls (which we run ALOT), inbounds plays, or isos, because who cares. 

**HORNS**

""Horns"" is a play that pretty much every NBA team runs. Westbrook is at the top of the key, usually Steve and PG (or Melo) will be on the elbows, and shooters (and Dre) will be in the corners. Russ will run a brush screen with Adams while Adams rim runs, and PG (or Melo) will slide up to the perimiter. 

https://streamable.com/aq5ya


**PG PINDOWN**

A very simple play. PG comes off a pindown screen set by Adams. George will read his defender to see if he trails or cheats. George can either shoot the jumper or attack the basket. 

https://streamable.com/5s4h4

If the defense cheats up, Steve will slip it for an easy lob.

https://streamable.com/qu7z0

**PG SWEEP**

Another play that gets George going. Comes across the court with a brush screen from one of our big men. The big man then re-screens George and runs a Pick-and-roll on the weak side.

https://streamable.com/0729f


**HAWK**

This one's my favorite, and probably our most versatile set. It gives multiple options for our guys, mostly Westbrook (the ballhandler), Melo, (strong side pick-and-roll), and George (comes off a weakside double pindown.) This is a reliable play to run down the stretch of a close game on multiple possessions. 

If the hedge defender cheats up, Melo is open

https://streamable.com/bm6kv

Of course Russ has free reign to use the initial pick-and-roll to his advantage:

https://streamable.com/ylq9l

If the initial pick-and-roll is played well, George is still coming off the double screen on the weak side:

https://streamable.com/gtfax

**SCREEN THE SCREENER**

This is one of Billy's go-to after timeout plays, and we mainly run it for Steve. Russ runs a pick-and-roll with Adams. While that happens, another player will set a backscreen on Adams' man, freeing up the lob. 

https://streamable.com/6przt

Those are just the basics. There are other ""pet"" plays and simple motions that Billy runs. The fun part is during the playoffs. These plays set the foundation for better execution come April. NBA offenses as a whole get more intricate, and these plays (especially Hawk) will get more complicated and more options will become available.

"Hello, I want to start by saying I haven't seen much melo slander here, but on r/NBA. People seem to think Carmelo is ""Washed up"" over there because he doesn't stuff the box score like he did in New York. Other than maybe when he was with AI or the last year in NY, Carmelo has always been the best player on his team.


On this new Thunder team obviously Billy Donovan hasn't run many plays to Carmelo Anthony, instead electing to run plays with him as a second option. I really like this by BD, because no team in the league will leave Melo open in a corner, switch a small onto Melo,or give Melo a lane to cut. Obviously this leads to Melos stats tanking when teams don't leave him like we saw tonight. 


The easier and much more effective way to play Melo would be to try and give him more minutes with the bench units,while PG and Russ are off the court. If you look at [this minutes chart by Alex Wainger](http://alexwainger.github.io/NBASubstitutionPatterns/) you can see Carmelo gets almost no minutes without Russ or PG on the court. 


IMO if you give Melo more minutes with the good defensive bench Unit you'll see great production and more Ws. I'm not saying I think Carmelo Anthony should come off the bench. It would very likely demoralize him and it would hurt the starting unit badly. Instead I think they should elect to check him out earlier in the 1st Q and put him in earlier in the 2Q and do the same thing in the 3rd & 4th Qs. Instead of this, BD has been trying all season to get Carmelo to play off the ball more like Paul George has been doing lately. Unfortunately the transition has been taking Carmelo a lot longer than George and we're 52 games in. Ultimately I am not a NBA head coach and can't say what's best for a team,but I do think I have a very valid point. I also think the Thunder have lost numerous close games and could easily be the 4th or 3rd seed, and have no reason to panic. 


**TL;DR:** Carmelo would be more effective if he got more minutes when PG and Russ rest.","Why Carmelo Anthony is struggling Hello, I want to start by saying I haven't seen much melo slander here, but on r/NBA.

"Man not thunder related but if the rumours are true that Lebron would meet with GSW, and he eventually signed, first of all his legacy would be ruined, secondly, if i was another team in the NBA I'd just refuse to play them. Not because I was afraid or anything like that, but they've just ruined the competitiveness in the NBA. I think that's the reason I despise the Warriors and KD so much, and if Lebron was to go there too well jeez, I couldn't see the point in following the NBA anymore, what a weak ass move :/","Lebron to GSW Man not thunder related but if the rumours are true that Lebron would meet with GSW, and he eventually signed, first of all his legacy would be ruined, secondly, if i was another team in the NBA I'd just refuse to play them.

"Nuggets - Away - L

Pelicans - Home - W

Lakers - Home - W

Warriors - Away - L (This is going to be extremely hard, the warriors are 19-6 at home plus they will be coming for revenge after our last spanking blowout we served to them, that could go very good for them or very bad)

Lakers - Away - W

Grizzlies - Home - W

Cavaliers - Home - W/L? They lost K.Love, it can go either way, it depends who they picked up before then and if they're starting to gel. But based on our last meeting i'm going to give us the slight advantage W. (Melo takes LeBron game very personal, which leads to good games for him)

Grizzlies - Away - W

Kings - Away - W 

Warriors - Away - W (Maybe we can pull an upset after losing early in the month to them?, this season shows that we show up in big games, plus by then we should have filled the SG role or C role, or even better both! Don't sleep on Presti, hes the deadline magician)

Magic - Home - W

Mavericks - Away - L (Because we wouldn't be the Thunder without losing to another sub .500 team after beating the warriors)

Prediction: 9-3 //// Record: 39-24 (I wouldn't be mad if we dropped another game than predicted, 8-4 is still a success and i'll still take that, but we could also be better than i predicted! 12-0 BOIS!)

"Right, so fresh of our blockbuster trade with the Pacers, maybe they'd be down to hand over one more asset in exchange for a brighter future?

A few points:

Lance and PG have a LOOOOOT of experience together.

Lance is a great player when he's not busy being too flashy. I think of Dion Waiters and the role he played for us two years ago. Talk shit about Dwait all you want but he was CRUCIAL for that team. 6th-ish man who can fucking hound a guy like Klay or Ariza... Gimme that dude.

If we're gonna trade a player, its gonna be Abrines. Abrines best friend in the NBA? Domas. Domas' team? Pacers. Honestly the Pacers could be a great place for a guy like Alex to blossom... Domas and Vic sure have.

It makes a lot of sense. What is everyone's thoughts? I haven't gone to the trade machine or anything but I also know they have Al Jefferson who could be a killer back up center when playing a team like the Spurs. We also have Jeremi as an asset and Vic is like his best friend, I'd rather try and keep him in FA tbh tho.

Also, Lance is on an AMAZING contract. I dont know if Pacers would want to give that up but honestly he has a great trade value right now if they're open to it. I'd rather have him than Tyreke.

"With Andre, Son of Rober unable to walk, the worries from the others and the anger Sir Brook of West was feeling, the journey home was long.  Any time one of his men tried to calm him down, or tell him everything was fine, all he would say was “I swear on the heavens, the next man to attempt conversation is getting a testicle full of fist.” 

Upon entering the gates, a commotion stirred from a nearby tavern.  A mixture of yelling and laughing filled the evening air, when suddenly, a young man careened through the front doors.  He saw our heroes and immediately fell out in tears asking for help.  A gang of men had been causing problems the last few days and refused to leave.  This is where Sir Brook shined.  Through his rapier, he let his anger speak. 
	
Kicking open the doors, Sir Brook laid eyes upon a man Joel and his band of 76-er-so men. The people through the land knew them only as the 6ers, shortened from 76ers, which was shortened from 76-er-so since there were 76-er-so of them that always traveled together.  (This was really really hard to come up with if I'm being completely honest).  With Andre lying in the arms of Squire Kiwi, and the deprivation of sleep laying among our heroes eyes, Joel knew he had an opening to speak however he pleased.  He approached Sir Brook, looked him up, then down, spit in his eye and spoke “I knew Andre was but a baby.  I did not know his mother was a wench from down under.”  

Without saying a word, Sir Brook [stares down](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5Ub2WVj7W3g/maxresdefault.jpg) Joel.   Then, with lightening fast cat like reflexes of a lightening cat, strikes twice below the belt, leaving him on the ground.  “Aye.” Sir Brook Speaks, “And I, as your father, have come to ground you, son.”  He looks around the room.  “If any other children have come for a spank, come forth, or step on.”  The band of 76-er-so men frantically scoop up Joel and run through the tavern doors with their tails between their legs. 

***********************

Our heroes enter Castle Chesapeake and quickly begin finishing tending to Andre's wounds.  With doctors standing by, they promise to heal him and treat him well.  Unfortunately, for our heroes, the healing process may take several months.  In the mean time, Andre, Son of Robes has sworn to continue working on his inner chi, heal properly, and come back to our men to fight another day.  

A rapid knock appears at the front gates.  The four heroes run downstairs to see who waits.  As the gate lowers, the see a small messenger boy with a scroll.  He clears his throat and reads:

“Sirs.  We enjoyed our last practice session so much, that we ask for your company once more.  We have heard of your misfortune with Andre, Son of Rober, as we have had our own misfortune as well with John the Wall.  We are nervous for your future endeavors and would ask for you to accept our invite for one more fighting session.  We hope to better prepare you for what is in store with the Warriors.  Please travel to Wash Town District with haste.  We hope to see you soon.”

The men agree with the absence of their brother, it may be a good idea to skirmish with the powerful mages once more.  They gather their things, a few extra men, and load up on Sir Raymond the Thicc who carries them north to meet the Wizards once more. 

************************

They arrive in Wash Town District.  Standing in amazement at the statues and monuments that portray the land, they are approached by a hooded assailant.  He exclaims he is there to help guide them to the Wizard's Guild and to follow him.

He guides them down a set of stairs which leads to a series of underground tunnels that take them to separate parts of the city.  “This way” the mage says, and scurries away, nearly leaving our heroes behind.  They pick up pace and try to keep up with him listening to the shuffle of his quick feet in the darkness of the tunnels.

Upon the first turn, Sir Raymond, the Thicc trips over a wire that was laid in the tunnel.  He gathers himself, dusts off, and tells the men to stay alert.  “Surely it was a root of sorts” Squire Kiwi speaks.  “Regardless, keep you eyes down low in case another 'root' appears” Sir Melo the Hooded says to the group.  

They continue on, as the hooded mage's voice echoes through the tunnel. “This way men!  We're not far!”

Sir Brook pick up pace, eager to catch up to the hooded man.  His hand lays on the wall to help guide him through the dark tunnel.  As his fingers scrape the stone, a lone square on the wall pushes in, releasing a door filled with dust above him, dropping dirt among his face.  He grabs his eyes, red from irritation, and tries dearly to clear them of debris. 

Raymond the Thicc says once more, “I really think these tunnels are laden with traps men!  We need to play it smart so we don't get hurt as well!”

Our heroes continue on.  Every time they catch up to the hooded man, he would take off once more, leading them through a maze of traps.  Some fire, some water.  Some traps contained spikes, and others shot arrows at our men.  Eventually, the finally made their way through, catching up to the hooded one in an underground temple of sorts.  The man stands in the middle of the room, greeting our heroes with ten other Wizards.  Simultaneously, they begin firing their wizardry upon our men, hitting almost all of them with every spell.  St PG, 13th of his name was the only unscathed brother standing since he believed magic was nothing more than smoke and mirrors.  The other men, however, already beaten from the traps in the tunnels, took quite the beating unfortunately.  However, right before what seemed to be the death of them, the Wizards stopped. The hooded mage they met earlier holds his hand up, approaches our men, and unsheathes his face. 
	
I am Grand Master Markieff.  “I was with John the Wall when we met a few days ago.  You men have a great power among you!”

“Is that why you had to cheat us, by using traps?!  You knew we were too strong for you!?” Sir Brook shouts. 

“Not at all.” Grand Master Markieff says.  “It is to show you that your foes will have no mercy on you in the future.  With what you learned today, you must go forth, prepared.  Prepare for dirty fights, and understand that you may subtly have to fight dirty as well.  If you so choose to be noble, and defeat your foes properly, then use your senses, your stomach, and your heart, to help you see the path to defeat thine enemy.”

Grand Master Markieff begins a prayer to heal our heroes.  After minutes of magic, they collect themselves once more, and stand gracefully at the feet of the Wizards.  Grand Master Markieff puts his hood on once more and under torchlight, shows our heroes a way out of the tunnel so they can be on their way.  

Before leaving for good, Grand Master Markieff speaks once more.  “There is a land of gold south west of here.  A group of mountain dwarfs have mined those tunnels for centuries.  Among their presence, lies a mass of gold that will give you mental strength.  The dwarfs will not hand it over lightly, however.  You must play your cards smart and take it when they least expect it.  Good luck men...and we hope to see you again soon.”

*************************

As our heroes begin their journey onward, Sir Brook quietly speaks to St PG.  “I don't like being tricked.  And I feel he is setting us up for failure once more should we travel to the mountains.”

“He is right though, Sir Brook.” St PG says.  “Everything you learned here today needs to be taken with you.  In order to get where you want to go, you must shutout your thoughts, and listen more to your body.  If you close your eyes, and let the world speak for you, the steps you take will always be in the right direction...”

"He played a really good game on the defensive end. He was keeping up with Beal around screens and providing good help defense as well. His mistakes at the end were costly but so were Russ's, Adams and Melos and they're veterans.

The more important thing tonight was that Huestis provided us with some of the defensive relief Roberson did and I think he needs to be in the starting lineup instead of Ferguson. Ferguson gets mismatched a lot because of his thin body and it forces everyone to work more to cover for him.","Despite his late game mistakes, Huestis was terrific defensively tonight.

I have season tickets (1 seat, Section 309, row K, seat 17) and I won't be making the game Friday against New Orleans. I'd like to give away my ticket in a creative way so I came up with this idea for a charity ticket auction.

The Rules:

-Bidding starts now and ends 11:59PM Thursday 2/1/2018

-Each bid must be made in increments of $1.00

-A proof of donation is required for each bid

-If two bids of the same amount are submitted, the one with the earliest time stamp gets the bid. (If by some crazy chance this happens, the person who lost that bid can donate $1.00 to take the bid.

-I am judge, jury, and executioner of this auction

-The first bid will be for $1.00, the second for $2.00, the third for $3.00 ect. If you bid $1.00 when the current bid is $4.00 your bid doesn't count but thank you for your donation.

I will be matching the winning bid (up to $50) and donating it to the winners charity of choice.

**EDITED RULE** If the bidding is still ongoing on thursday at midnight, I'll let bidding continue until there isn't another bid within 10 minutes of the last.
--------------------------

All donation can be made to any charity of your choice, but if someone could find what Dre's favorite charity is I think that would be a good place to donate.

But these Warriors man, seems like they drew in the most insufferable of ppl for their fan base. It's crazy.

Cavs - 28k
Rockets - 22k
Spurs - 20k
OKC - 20k

Lakers - 50k

But the Warriors.. a team who's fan base was non existent prior 2014...

GSW - 95k

Fuck KD. ","Who else finds this Warriors era bandwagoners insufferable? Man I remember how badly I wanted the Miami Heat era to finish. But at least people were fans of Bron and Wade prior to merging. 
But these Warriors man, seems like they drew in the most insufferable of ppl for their fan base. It's crazy.

I feel like Collison could bring some good backup defense for drives. He would also help Adams with rebounds.

"They are a defensive powerhouse, rivaling the best defensive teams of all time in any sport.

However, without Roberson can they still win the title? Going into the season, most had them pegged as the #1-#3 seeder and they could have easily surpassed Houston ever since Houston started declining with that huge losing streak, lack of effort, injuries, and general apathy towards the game of basketball.

Without Roberson, does Houston have a shot over them? Playoffs Melo, Playoffs PG, and regular Westy + Adam. Can GSW take OKC to 6-7 now? 

It has always been my opinion that Roberson is the 2nd most important player on the team after Westy and #1 defensively, and a top 20 player in the NBA currently in terms of impact. It's like if KD went down on the Warriors or James H went down on the Rockets. Make sure you recognize the effect this has on the NBA going forward, and for all sports everywhere.

Real recognize real. Roberson finna come back, perhaps as good or 80% as before and I'll take it.

"The Kid's got all the talent in the world and the 2 that this franchise has needed since Harden was traded. I believe Presti knows the kids potential and spent our only 1st rounder for years on him.

But we shouldnt want to trade him. It is difficult to find such a willing defender that is windmill dunking in game and can shoot the 3 as a rookie and is 6'7.

Yes he needs more muscle, and development, but he's also a rookie. 

He has star potential labeled all over him. It is not worth it. 

The downside to trading him is someone we could get like courtney lee could fall off as easily as next year, then Paul George is gone. Robes also may not fully recover so hell be a slower defender and has no offensive game to rely on. 

Melo could easily leave as well If LeBron tries to recruit him to a championship contender. 

We need someone who can be the future and we are definitely not finding better the Terrance Ferguson. We could easily have an all star level lineup 1-5 as early as next year if he develops quickly. 

The downsides to trading him for a barely above average player are too great. 

The pros are all short term and these players may not even be nearly as productive in our system when sharing the ball with the players we have now. 

Scoring 20 on the knicks is alot different than scoring 20 with us. 

Also whoever you trade for needs to be able to play offball well and I havent seen any discussion on that. 

Overall, T-Ferg's ceiling is way, way, too high to trade for courtney Lee who might, be good for us and might end up disappointing us and then losing our future. Meanwhile Ferg really isnt all that much worse than him at 19.

"Sir Brook of West bids good morning to the men as they meet in the mess hall ready for what the world has to offer.  He looks around and notices something is off, Saint PG, Squire Kiwi, and Sir Melo have arrived, but Andre, Son of Rober is nowhere to be found.  Sir Brook asks his men if they have seen him.  With a collective “No,” Sir Brook searches.  

It wasn’t hard to figure that Andre was probably still in his resting quarters.  He’s quite the sleeper after all.  Sir Brook knocks on his door but there is no response.  He raps once more, “Andre, the Sun is awake, our day is ready!”  Still nothing.  With a twist of the handle, the door creaks open and Sir Brook steps, still no sign of Andre.  He investigates the room.  Everything seems to be in order except for some parchment on his bed.  Sir Brook reads the note:
“Men,
I’m unsure what this world has in store for me.  The wizards spoke a truth that was fairly hard to swallow, and I feel I am of no help to you all unless I can truly find myself.  I have packed my things and began travelling north, alone, as some peace and quiet may do my mind some good.  I hope you understand.
Regards,
Andre, Son of Rober”

Sir Brook clenches the note and takes it down to his men in the mess.  Hunger is broken as he slams it on the table for all to see. 
“Our brother has left us!” Sir Brook shouts. “He is shaken.  I fear he has left for good but we shan’t let it happen.  Pack your things men, we’re bringing him home.”

With haste, our heroes pack rations and clothes, and begin their journey to find Andre.

********************************
As Andre Travels, he knows not where he is going, nor where he will end up, but I bet he lands in Detroit since this is still an underlying recap of last night’s game.

As the days pass, he grows weary from his travels.  His thoughts have become harder to manage and he knows he must break soon.  He sees a pass up a hill and decides to hike it.  A few more strides and he will reach a destination he feels the universe has called him to.  Tired legs continue to shuffle under him until finally, he finds himself on the top of a cliff overlooking a river.  To his left, Lake St Clair, to his right, Lake Erie.  It’s a beautiful sight.  With plains as far as the eye can see, and lakes that look as large as oceans, he feels himself overcome with calm emotions and decides to make camp.

With smoke bellowing from the campfire, Andre takes time to rest his feet.  His soggy shoes from the northern snow rest beside the fire to dry.  He toys with the idea John the Wall has planted; relax, clear your mind, and summon your inner chi.  As he meditates, falling deeper into his thoughts, the silence of nature is broken.

“Ho there, traveler.” A voice beckons.  

Andre opens his eyes to see five horsemen trotting towards him.  “HO!” he responds.

“What is a gent like yourself doing alone up here.  It is freezing!”

“Just admiring the beauty” Andre says. 

“Well sir, judging by the colors of your flag, it seems as though you have come a long way. Are you alone?” 

Andre feels uneasy with the questions…“Nay…My men are yonder, searching for food.” 

The horsemen look around briefly, then back at Andre, “Why must you lie? We have patrolled the area before noticing your signal fire.  Why don’t you gather your things and come with us?”

“That isn’t necessary,” Andre says. “I will be on my way soon.  I’m just passing through.”

One of the horsemen speak. “Why would a lone traveler from the south just pass through?  It looks as though he may be sent from his king to spy!”

Distraught, Andre stands up in preparation of defending himself.  “I am not a spy, nor preparing for a battle of any kind.  If you could so kindly leave me at peace, it would be appreciated!”

The horsemen draw their swords. “You can come with us for questioning, or you can lie here in peace until the gods come find you.” 
“If this is how you want to die,” Andre says, collecting his sword and shield “then I suggest you pray for forgiveness now.”

Meanwhile, Sir Brook of West and his men are not far behind.  Over the horizon, our men see smoke in the snow laden fields.  “That must be him!” Sir Brook shouts.  “His tracks lead right towards it!”

They pick up speed and trod quickly through the powder.  As they near the smoke, they hear shouts of despair, and the clamoring of arms.  Worried, our heroes begin running.  Following the tracks Andre had left behind, on the pass, up the hill, just a few more steps and they should be reunited.

As they grow near, the shouting gets louder.  Among all the voices, one is distinguished truly as Andre, Son of Rober. “I fear he is in dire trouble men!” Sir Brook shouts.

“I don’t know if we can make it in time!” Squire Kiwi shouts back, “But we can’t let our brother fall!”

The last few agonizing minutes of their journey were hard to bare.  The clamoring of swords became a whisper.  It sounds as if only two were left and they hoped one of them was their brother.  With blistered feet, and burning legs, they finally reach the crest of the overhanging cliff.  The sight they see is both amazing and terrifying.  Andre, Son of Rober, stands tired as enemies and horses lay scattered around him.  
He is locked in arms with one of the mounts, tired and bloody. 

Andre, unaware that his men are near, begins relaxing under the pressure of the horseman’s sword. The world around him begins to fade to black.  He breathes heavily and looks deep within himself. Remembering what John the Wall had said, he immediately snaps open his eyes.  The lone horseman quickly turns from anger to fear upon making eye contact with Andre. With the strength of a bear, Andre pushes back against the Horseman, knocking him from his mount.

“Today is not the day I die…” Andre says to him. He points at the scared horseman and shouts for the world to hear. “TODAY… I LIVE!” A ray bursts from the tip of his finger.  With a light emitting from the ray, it seems to dim the world around him.  His blood is filled with rage as he continues to sear through the horseman’s helm.  

Until finally…quiet…

Andre, Son of Robes falls to his knees.  He is shaking.

Our heroes run to him in shock and awe of what they witnessed.  After minutes of silence, Andre speaks.  “I am sorry…I shouldn’t have left you guys.”

 Saint PG, puts his hand on his shoulder and looks around at the bloody battlefield.
“I…think I’m ready to go home.” Andre pants.

Sir Brook begins to gather Andre’s belongings. Squire Kiwi and Sir Melo help him up off the ground and Saint PG attempts to heal his wounds.  With Andre slumped over Squire Kiwi and Sir Melo, they begin to walk off when suddenly, Andre lets out a loud shriek of sheer pain. 
Sir Brook turn towards him and screams. “NOOOO!” and runs to him “NO! NO NO NO!!!” As Andre falls to the ground, his men see an arrow pierced through his leg.  They look up to see a horseman, crossbow in hand, readying another bolt. Squire Kiwi quickly picks up Andre who is writhing in pain, shaking from shock, trying his hardest not to bleed out.  Sir Melo and Squire Kiwi, Andre in arms, quickly flee with him. 
Sir Brook of West runs to the downed horseman, and out of sheer anger begins hacking away with his sword.  With blood showering the land around him, Saint PG barely pulls him away from the soldier.   The horseman lay, looking as though a pack of hungry wolves attacked him as Sir Brook and Saint PG begin trailing the group.

“This isn’t fair…” Sir Brook says under his breath…

Saint PG with calming eyes looks at Sir Brook and speaks. “Life isn’t fair, Sir.  Andre, although the wound looks fatal, will return.  Until then, we must continue.”

Our heroes hastily begin their travel home. Sir Brook walks alone thinking…”Life isn’t fair.  But we will get what’s ours.  For Andre, Son of Rober, my friend and brother, I will get my revenge…”

To be continued...


","Gathering for breakfast...(Thunder vs Pistons) Sir Brook of West bids good morning to the men as they meet in the mess hall ready for what the world has to offer.  He looks around and notices something is off, Saint PG, Squire Kiwi, and Sir Melo have arrived, but Andre, Son of Rober is nowhere to be found.  Sir Brook asks his men if they have seen him.  With a collective “No,” Sir Brook searches.  

It wasn’t hard to figure that Andre was probably still in his resting quarters.  He’s quite the sleeper after all.  Sir Brook knocks on his door but there is no response.  He raps once more, “Andre, the Sun is awake, our day is ready!”  Still nothing.  With a twist of the handle, the door creaks open and Sir Brook steps, still no sign of Andre.  He investigates the room.  Everything seems to be in order except for some parchment on his bed.  Sir Brook reads the note:
“Men,
I’m unsure what this world has in store for me.  The wizards spoke a truth that was fairly hard to swallow, and I feel I am of no help to you all unless I can truly find myself.  I have packed my things and began travelling north, alone, as some peace and quiet may do my mind some good.  I hope you understand.
Regards,
Andre, Son of Rober”

Sir Brook clenches the note and takes it down to his men in the mess.  Hunger is broken as he slams it on the table for all to see. 
“Our brother has left us!” Sir Brook shouts. “He is shaken.  I fear he has left for good but we shan’t let it happen.  Pack your things men, we’re bringing him home.”

With haste, our heroes pack rations and clothes, and begin their journey to find Andre.

********************************
As Andre Travels, he knows not where he is going, nor where he will end up, but I bet he lands in Detroit since this is still an underlying recap of last night’s game.

As the days pass, he grows weary from his travels.  His thoughts have become harder to manage and he knows he must break soon.  He sees a pass up a hill and decides to hike it.  A few more strides and he will reach a destination he feels the universe has called him to.  Tired legs continue to shuffle under him until finally, he finds himself on the top of a cliff overlooking a river.  To his left, Lake St Clair, to his right, Lake Erie.  It’s a beautiful sight.  With plains as far as the eye can see, and lakes that look as large as oceans, he feels himself overcome with calm emotions and decides to make camp.

With smoke bellowing from the campfire, Andre takes time to rest his feet.  His soggy shoes from the northern snow rest beside the fire to dry.  He toys with the idea John the Wall has planted; relax, clear your mind, and summon your inner chi.  As he meditates, falling deeper into his thoughts, the silence of nature is broken.

“Ho there, traveler.” A voice beckons.  

Andre opens his eyes to see five horsemen trotting towards him.  “HO!” he responds.

“What is a gent like yourself doing alone up here.  It is freezing!”

“Just admiring the beauty” Andre says. 

“Well sir, judging by the colors of your flag, it seems as though you have come a long way. Are you alone?” 

Andre feels uneasy with the questions…“Nay…My men are yonder, searching for food.” 

The horsemen look around briefly, then back at Andre, “Why must you lie? We have patrolled the area before noticing your signal fire.  Why don’t you gather your things and come with us?”

“That isn’t necessary,” Andre says. “I will be on my way soon.  I’m just passing through.”

One of the horsemen speak. “Why would a lone traveler from the south just pass through?  It looks as though he may be sent from his king to spy!”

Distraught, Andre stands up in preparation of defending himself.  “I am not a spy, nor preparing for a battle of any kind.  If you could so kindly leave me at peace, it would be appreciated!”

The horsemen draw their swords. “You can come with us for questioning, or you can lie here in peace until the gods come find you.” 
“If this is how you want to die,” Andre says, collecting his sword and shield “then I suggest you pray for forgiveness now.”

"I'm an OKC fan living in Detroit now, so a fan of both teams I'd say. Based on my own opinion and the opinions of others on the Pistons sub, getting Bradley shouldn't be too hard for OKC. 

From what we've seen so far, we've actually played better with Luke Kennard on the starting lineup both offensively and defensively. He's only 21 and already the best shooter on the team. No need to stop his development and force Bradley to keep playing. Plus since Kennard is a SG, we don't truly need Ferguson since they play the same position. 

Also Bradley can walk at the end of the season and is most likely going to leave us and look for $20mil+ so I don't think expecting a first rounder is realistic (unless Cleveland ends up wanting him for their own pick).

Abrines would be good for us as a backup SG and hopefully he gets his shot back and keeps improving. We are lacking at both SF and PF, so either Huestis or Grant would be nice young prospects there. Throw in a second rounder to sweeten the deal and I'd like it as a Pistons fan. 
 
What do yall think?

Send: Abrines + Huestis + 2nd rounder

Receive: Avery Bradley

Edit: as a Thunder fan and someone who's watched Bradley this season, here are some downsides. He seems to have lost his shot and keeps bricking long 2s while taking like 16 of them a game. He can't dribble whatsoever and has trouble making wide open layups on a fastbreak. His defense hasn't been consistently good like it was on the Celtics, maybe because he was injured for a few weeks. Him being injury prone is also a negative. Also I don't think OKC can afford to keep him after this season, so he'd be a rental. 

On the plus side, he won't have to shoot as much on OKC and can focus on playing great D the entire game. Plus, he's a good spot up 3 shooter. I don't know why he takes so many long 2s but hopefully he takes the wide open 3s he would get next to 3 superstars.

"You cant replace Dre. If he was a bigger name he'd be a forrunner for DPOY. Hes 2nd in DRPM after tonight in a position that does not rate highly in that stat in general (next SG is Victor at 27th a massive % rating wise behind), Dre is elite and he makes the teams D hum. 

I think its clear with a view to being competative in the play offs Ferg and abrines are not viable options - both are far to poor on that end of the floor at this point in there careers and going forward with them = no chance I think. 

In house I think Heustis would be the best option but positionally its not a great fit but it wouldnt take too many shenanigans to make it work. Its not perfect but I think better than the above options. 

Outisde players - I've seen courntney lee being mentioned but I think thats a non starter both with his contract and hes also had some alarming drop in any def metrics this year. 

Personally I think I would be in contact with the Jazz and see about maybe bringing Thabo back - financially I think it fits and hes still very close to elite def. He isnt dre but I think in terms of the def effort bought would be as close as you can find. Familiar with the place and people etc and is a guy who knows his role and could continue to enable PG to wreck havoc on lesser players.

"Before tonight we were only after a bench wing. Abrines + 2nd round pick would have got us someone like Alec Burks. 

Now we need a starting quality wing with good defense the question is whether we can get that player without a 1st to trade. Bradley would be perfect but we simply won't get him without a 1st, but we could get him with Ferguson.

Would Presti trade Ferguson to get Bradley as a rental? 

I really hope it doesn't come to that because Ferg is showing a heap of potential and hopefully we can get someone like Garrett Temple for Abrines + Singler + 2nd round pick.

"This looks bad. They’ve got the stretcher out, he looks likes having a tough time moving his lower body. Could be a broken pelvis or leg, something like that.

He’s just returned from an injury, as well, this is really saddening. Dre appears to be crying as they carry him out. Here’s hoping for a speedy recovery! 

**Update:** *Roberson has ruptured his patellar tendon, and is looking at 6 months on the sideline, possibly more as he’s just returned from patellar tendinitis in the same knee. Thunder medical staff will be cautious to put him back in until he’s 100% ready, so he might end up missing some of next season.*

"A few days had passed since our heroes have defeated the fisherman pirates who called themselves the Nets.  A feast ensues for the return of the heroes which included plenty of fish.  Everyone among the city was invited to Castle Chesapeake to enjoy with our heroes.  

Few travelers were there, however, those who traveled through the land were welcome.  Among those who traversed their way through the center of the state were a small group of mere magicians.  Intrigued by their presence, Sir Brook of West confronted them and asked to perform a few tricks for him and his men.  As a form of payment, our heroes offered to give them lessons in melee combat. The magic bunch agreed and joyfully entertained the guests. 

Throughout the rest of the feast, these mages kept everyone's attention with mere party tricks; card tricks, rabbits, and scarves were passed throughout the party-goers and joyous laughter filled the halls. 

As Sir Brook of West sat in his chair, a mage had made his way to him.  Towering over our hero, he politely introduced himself.  “They call me John the Wall.”  He reached out with the hand of a giant to gracefully make Sir Brook's acquaintance. “May I sit with you sir?”

Sir Brook of West glances at the chair next to him and nods.  

“We have relished in the kindness of your city” John the Wall states.  “However, we didn't come here to parlay.”

Sir Brook looks on quizzically. 

“No sir, we came to help.  We heard how you defeated King James and his men who terrorize our district.  Your men and yourself are very strong individuals.  Word traveled throughout, stating of the men who defeated King James and the motivation behind it.  We, the Wizards, feel we may be of help.”

Sir Brook of West laughs lightly.  He looks at John the Wall.  “...Wizards?”

“Aye, Sir.  Like Mages except we truly are Magic.  We summon our powers through the energy among ourselves, and the energy that surrounds us.”

“Pardon for the disbelief, but if you care to demonstrate, I'm quite curious.”  Sir Brook of West says. 

Pondering for a moment, he points to a candle stick in the corner.  “You see that candle?  I shall blow it out from here.”

John the Wall presses his lips, puts his palms together, and with a gentle stream, his air pushes through the tips of his fingers.  The air cools around them as the breath travels many yards away, and just as the flame was birthed, it suddenly dimmed, and quickly died.  Smoke circles from the freshly quenched wick and Sir Brook of West sat in disbelief.

He finally speaks, “It is a bit drafty in here, wouldn't you say mage?”

John the Wall chuckles and tells him to look again.  He snaps his fingers and as soon as the sound reached Sir Brook's ear, the candle was lit once again. 

“Tis a small trick indeed, however, we as a group are capable of much more.  You and your men have the blood of a wizard among you that has yet to discover his true power and potential.  We wanted to offer OUR services to YOU in hopes that you truly are the chosen ones to defeat the Republic of California's Warriors and reign over the West.”

Sir Brook sits as confused as I sit writing this.  

“It sounds crazy, Sir Brook,” John the Wall states “but it is true.  Meet us in the morn.  We will be waiting by the gates as the sun begins to rise.”

“Let me discuss with my men, John the Wall, and we will find you.”


Morning comes, and the men find themselves tired, yet hastily walking to the gate on the out skirts of The Town of Bricks. 

“Who do you think they're talking about?”  Saint PG, 13th of his name asks. 

“OY, I think it is you, Saint!”  Squire Kiwi says hastily. 

“No no! I am but a saint.  I don't perform in such trickery as wizards do.  Maybe Sir Melo the Hooded?”

The group laughs as they approach the waiting Wizards.

“You have come! Greetings!”  John the Wall booms.  “With Haste, hail your arms, and let's practice.”

Our heroes wearily draw their weapons, unaware they would battle this day.  As soon as the last weapon is drawn, a fireball emerges from John the Wall and quickly shoots towards the middle of the group.  Andre, Son of Robes, quickly pushes his team aside.  

“You're trying to kill us!”  Andre shouts.

“Not kill, Son of Robes.  Teach!”  John the Wall summons a quick bolt of lightening and fires at Andre.  
The Wizards gather round each other, their energy seeming to spark.

Our heroes stand, compose themselves and proceed to deliver an ass whooping for for thirty minutes.  Despite getting the shit kicked out of them, however, the Wizards fail to fall.  With magic that stimulates the air, the group of Wizards manipulate the earth and weather around them.  The skirmish continues among a thunderstorm and their power continues to grow.  Firing lightening bolts, small tornadoes, and conceiving claps of deafening thunder, the Wizards seemingly begin to overpower our heroes. 

Batter and bruised, our heroes stand soaked, bleeding and out of breath.  The Wizards group together once more, placing their hands together to deliver what would seem to be a final blow against our heroes.  As the ball of energy grows in power, the rain suddenly stops.  The weather clears to a light mist, and the Wizards weapon of choice begins to shrink.  Raymond the Thick suddenly emerges from the fog, smiling.  “Hi Guys!  Need some help?”

“Raymond!” Sir Brook of West shouts.  “You're the one with wizard blood?”

“Huh?  Yeah I thought you knew...”

Sir Brook looks at John the Wall confused.  Face in hand, John the Wall points.  “Not him...HIM!”  and immediately directs toward Andre, Son of Rober.  

“Me? There's no way I have wizard blood in me.  I can't cast any spells!”

“Yes you! Your great great times 13 great grandmother was a grandmaster.  It's in your blood child!  You need to look deep within you, breathe, relax, and summon your chi...”

“It's not me.  You've got the wrong guy.” Andre says as he begins to walk away. 

John the Wall grabs Andre's shoulder.  “Listen to me!  I've come to he-”

“NO!” Andre shouts.  As he does, a whirlwind pushes the Wizards backwards.  Andre, Son of Rober begins his trek back to Castle Chesapeake.  Stunned, both groups of men lay on the ground, watching him walk away, and once more it begins to rain.  

“Quiet and somber sweeps over them.  John the Wall slowly approaches Sir Brook and speaks quietly.  “Take care of that boy.  Among you five, you will defeat the Warriors.  However, to truly sweep them, Andre needs to understand who he is.”

Sir Brook of West pauses briefly, then nods in approval.

“Until we meet again, John the Wall...”

to be continued...","Sitting in Castle Chesapeake...(Thunder vs Wizards) A few days had passed since our heroes have defeated the fisherman pirates who called themselves the Nets.  A feast ensues for the return of the heroes which included plenty of fish.  Everyone among the city was invited to Castle Chesapeake to enjoy with our heroes.  

Few travelers were there, however, those who traveled through the land were welcome.  Among those who traversed their way through the center of the state were a small group of mere magicians.  Intrigued by their presence, Sir Brook of West confronted them and asked to perform a few tricks for him and his men.  As a form of payment, our heroes offered to give them lessons in melee combat. The magic bunch agreed and joyfully entertained the guests. 

Throughout the rest of the feast, these mages kept everyone's attention with mere party tricks; card tricks, rabbits, and scarves were passed throughout the party-goers and joyous laughter filled the halls. 

As Sir Brook of West sat in his chair, a mage had made his way to him.  Towering over our hero, he politely introduced himself.  “They call me John the Wall.”  He reached out with the hand of a giant to gracefully make Sir Brook's acquaintance. “May I sit with you sir?”

Sir Brook of West glances at the chair next to him and nods.  

“We have relished in the kindness of your city” John the Wall states.  “However, we didn't come here to parlay.”

Sir Brook looks on quizzically. 

“No sir, we came to help.  We heard how you defeated King James and his men who terrorize our district.  Your men and yourself are very strong individuals.  Word traveled throughout, stating of the men who defeated King James and the motivation behind it.  We, the Wizards, feel we may be of help.”

Sir Brook of West laughs lightly.  He looks at John the Wall.  “...Wizards?”

“Aye, Sir.  Like Mages except we truly are Magic.  We summon our powers through the energy among ourselves, and the energy that surrounds us.”

“Pardon for the disbelief, but if you care to demonstrate, I'm quite curious.”  Sir Brook of West says. 

Pondering for a moment, he points to a candle stick in the corner.  “You see that candle?  I shall blow it out from here.”

John the Wall presses his lips, puts his palms together, and with a gentle stream, his air pushes through the tips of his fingers.  The air cools around them as the breath travels many yards away, and just as the flame was birthed, it suddenly dimmed, and quickly died.  Smoke circles from the freshly quenched wick and Sir Brook of West sat in disbelief.

He finally speaks, “It is a bit drafty in here, wouldn't you say mage?”

John the Wall chuckles and tells him to look again.  He snaps his fingers and as soon as the sound reached Sir Brook's ear, the candle was lit once again. 

“Tis a small trick indeed, however, we as a group are capable of much more.  You and your men have the blood of a wizard among you that has yet to discover his true power and potential.  We wanted to offer OUR services to YOU in hopes that you truly are the chosen ones to defeat the Republic of California's Warriors and reign over the West.”

Sir Brook sits as confused as I sit writing this.  

“It sounds crazy, Sir Brook,” John the Wall states “but it is true.  Meet us in the morn.  We will be waiting by the gates as the sun begins to rise.”

“Let me discuss with my men, John the Wall, and we will find you.”


Morning comes, and the men find themselves tired, yet hastily walking to the gate on the out skirts of The Town of Bricks. 

“Who do you think they're talking about?”  Saint PG, 13th of his name asks. 

“OY, I think it is you, Saint!”  Squire Kiwi says hastily. 

“No no! I am but a saint.  I don't perform in such trickery as wizards do.  Maybe Sir Melo the Hooded?”

The group laughs as they approach the waiting Wizards.

“You have come! Greetings!”  John the Wall booms.  “With Haste, hail your arms, and let's practice.”

Our heroes wearily draw their weapons, unaware they would battle this day.  As soon as the last weapon is drawn, a fireball emerges from John the Wall and quickly shoots towards the middle of the group.  Andre, Son of Robes, quickly pushes his team aside.  

“You're trying to kill us!”  Andre shouts.

“Not kill, Son of Robes.  Teach!”  John the Wall summons a quick bolt of lightening and fires at Andre.  
The Wizards gather round each other, their energy seeming to spark.

Our heroes stand, compose themselves and proceed to deliver an ass whooping for for thirty minutes.  Despite getting the shit kicked out of them, however, the Wizards fail to fall.  With magic that stimulates the air, the group of Wizards manipulate the earth and weather around them.  The skirmish continues among a thunderstorm and their power continues to grow.  Firing lightening bolts, small tornadoes, and conceiving claps of deafening thunder, the Wizards seemingly begin to overpower our heroes. 

Batter and bruised, our heroes stand soaked, bleeding and out of breath.  The Wizards group together once more, placing their hands together to deliver what would seem to be a final blow against our heroes.  As the ball of energy grows in power, the rain suddenly stops.  The weather clears to a light mist, and the Wizards weapon of choice begins to shrink.  Raymond the Thick suddenly emerges from the fog, smiling.  “Hi Guys!  Need some help?”

“Raymond!” Sir Brook of West shouts.  “You're the one with wizard blood?”

“Huh?  Yeah I thought you knew...”

Sir Brook looks at John the Wall confused.  Face in hand, John the Wall points.  “Not him...HIM!”  and immediately directs toward Andre, Son of Rober.  

“Me? There's no way I have wizard blood in me.  I can't cast any spells!”

“Yes you! Your great great times 13 great grandmother was a grandmaster.  It's in your blood child!  You need to look deep within you, breathe, relax, and summon your chi...”

“It's not me.  You've got the wrong guy.” Andre says as he begins to walk away. 

John the Wall grabs Andre's shoulder.  “Listen to me!  I've come to he-”

“NO!” Andre shouts.  As he does, a whirlwind pushes the Wizards backwards.  Andre, Son of Rober begins his trek back to Castle Chesapeake.  Stunned, both groups of men lay on the ground, watching him walk away, and once more it begins to rain.  

“Quiet and somber sweeps over them.  John the Wall slowly approaches Sir Brook and speaks quietly.  “Take care of that boy.  Among you five, you will defeat the Warriors.  However, to truly sweep them, Andre needs to understand who he is.”

Sir Brook of West pauses briefly, then nods in approval. 

“Until we meet again Sir...” John says.

John the Wall gathers his men and they begin to continue their journey onward. 

Sir Brook and his men stand in the rain, glance at Andre, Son of Rober once more before he disappears in the thick sheets of rain...

“Until we meet again, John the Wall...”

"This was something that was never brought up until a video was made about it by BBALLBREAKDOWN earlier in the season when we were having our struggles. Ever since then it seems like people are constantly bringing it up. Even now when Russ is playing arguably the best basketball of his career, Thunder fans are still claiming he needs to add it to his game, when in reality, it's bullshit. It's another fake narrative that people have made popular as an attempt to knock Russ's game, just like the ""Russ doesn't make his teammates better"" narrative.

&nbsp;

If Russ thought off-ball movement could elevate his game, don't you think he would do it? Or at least try it? Russ is a superstar, he has done and will do whatever he can in order to be the best player possible. Russell's game is based around attacking the rim, no other player burns as much energy as him, attacking the rim, non stop every single game. If he ran about like crazy off ball running through screens and so on he would be completely exhausted toward the end of the game.

&nbsp;

The reason players like Steph Curry run like crazy off-ball is because his whole game is based around running through screens and shooting threes, it's what he's good at. He also doesn't use most of his stamina attacking the rim most posessions. Let Russ do what he's good at instead of trying to change his game. The man just won an MVP, averaged a triple double and is now playing in my opinion better than he's ever played in his career over the course of the last month and a half.","Can we stop the whole ""Russ needs to move more off-ball"" narrative now?

"The journey home was long for our heroes, but riding the high of the skirmish they endured days prior kept them full of vigor.  After a few days travel, with little rest, they found themselves on the outskirts of home.  Smiling from ear to ear, they continued onward towards Castle Chesapeake. 

Walking through the suburbs of the Castle, lay a town built solely of bricks.  Upon seeing our heroes return, the people began shrieking and yelling towards them.  As our heroes proudly walked onward, they felt very uneasy. 

As they walked under a bridge crossing outside of their castle, they noticed a mob of villagers shouting.  Andre, Son of Rober puts his hand on the shoulder of a nearby drum playing popper and asks what the commotion is.

“Sir! Sir!” the pauper shouts. “A group of pirates from the east has come for you all!” 

St George, 13th of his name pushes through the crowd to better seat himself in front of the castle. After a quick glimpse, he immediately understands.  He pushes back to his group to relay the details.

“A group of pirates indeed.” St George proclaims.  “Have we met them before?.”

“Aye.” Squire Kiwi says.  “But you, St George, we're not with us at the time.  It was on our journey south, to the land beyond the wall of nonexistence. 

The group recalls together.  A band of pirates set up a surprise ambush in Mexico's Capital.  After a hard fought battle, the pirates left our heroes for dead.  However, before falling unconscious, Sir Brook of West recalls the last words murmured to him before blacking out. “Don't forget our name...we are-”

“The nets...” Sir Brook of West proclaims.  

“And they're not pirates, they're rogue fishermen.” Sir Melo the Hooded says.  “They are from a city among the outskirts of my old home.  A small coastal region surrounded by water.  They were once a group of hard working men; however, after years of being abusedby my home city, they had enough.  They became angered and proceeded to separate themselves from the New City of York, to become the “pirates” they claim to be today.”  

Squire Kiwi booms with laughter.  “The nets have no right to be here, let alone in our castle.  Who let them in anyway?”

The uneasy pauper tells the heroes of the raid. While squirming to free himself from under Andre's continuous grip, the pauper tells the story of how the nets raided the city while our heroes traveled to the land of Cleve.

Andre, Son of Rober chuckles. The pauper, finally free from his grip, begins to trot off.  “Pauper!” Andre shouts.  “Tell the nets we have arrived.”  He tosses the pauper a 'Thunder Cares' shirt as a form of payment, turns back to the group, and speaks.  

“We need to formulate a plan gents...  For back then, we were without St. George!  This time, we have the upper hand.”

“Those poor bastards.” Sir Brook of West whispers under his breath...


The day quickly turned to eve.  Our heroes had gathered a plan and were ready to take action.  Confidently, they reach the front gates of the castle.

Walking through the corridors of Castle Chesapeake, they find themselves once more, in the middle of a dimly lit arena.  Echos surround our heroes.  They quickly press themselves back to back. 

Suddenly, a single set of foot steps fill the air.  Our heroes proceed to look in all directions when a snake haired man steps forth. 

“Sir Melo the Hooded...”  A voice clamors. “I thought I left you for dead many moons ago.”

Sir Melo looks at the direction of the voice.  “Child!  Come forth and let me see who speaks!”

Out of the shadows, a 6'5 man approaches.  “Child!” He yells.  “I am grown! It is you who wept like the child when I left you to the buzzards!”

“Russel the Angel...”  Sir Melo says. “You have beaten me but once and that was merely by surprise!  I see you've delivered yourself to my home for swift kick in the pants!” 

Russel the Angel unsheathes his sword.  “I will do the kicking Sir Melo the Hooded...And after I'm done here, you will run away from these gents, just as you have in the past...Now take out your sword and fight me IRL.”

A fishing pole lowers down and rests upon Russel the Angel's sword.  Russel the Angel looks up to see St. George, 13th of his name with a wry grin on his face.

“What is the meaning of this?” Russel the Angel shouts.

“House rules, bitch.”  St. George says.  

Andre, Son of Rober explains. “To win, you must fish.  If you all are so good at your craft, this should be no issue. However, where you have a team of pretend pirates...we have an actual skilled fisherman in our small brigade.  The group with the highest weight in fish, will be chosen as the winner.”

“If you win,”  Andre explains, “you keep our fish, and your fish.  You claim our territory as your own.  We pay your fee's home and never step foot in your land again for probably a few months.  However, WHEN you LOSE, you leave our land, the fish you caught, your coin, and you have to go home and tell everyone that you lost which really really sucks...”

Angel thinks heavily...  “Aye...that sounds like a plan...”

7:15PM approaches quickly.  Our heroes emerge at the canal armed with fishing poles. They make their way to the bank and proceed to set bait on their hooks.  

The Eastern pirates show up with nothing more than their fishing nets.  Sir Melo objects stating they need to fish with poles.  Angel argues back “Whoops...you must have looked over the rule where you said we FISH.  You never told us HOW to fish.  We'll use our nets while you catch only one at a time.”

Our heroes cast into the river.  A single fish being caught with every net load the pirates seem to beach.  Over and over our heroes find themselves glancing towards the pirates as they haul in more fish.  With every net load they drag up, our men continue to get more and more flustered.  

Squire Kiwi approaches St George.  “This is ignorant!  We'll never win by fishing this way!”  

Sir Brook of West pipes in, frustrated.  “He's right! With nothing but the hooks on our poles, we won't catch as many fish as the Pirates.  We should cut holes in their nets.”

St George looks at them with calm eyes and says “There are two types of fisherman, Squire.  Those that fish for sport...and those that fish for fish. And sir Brook of West...I would prefer we lose with honor, than win by cheating.  There is a time to fish...and a time to dry the nets.”

“Well, St George, I think it's time to dry my nets then...”  Sir Brook of West and Squire Kiwi walk up the bank to sit. 

Suddenly, the water in the river begins to bubble.  Our heroes stare on as the bubbles get bigger and faster.  Soon the water begins to splash ferociously as a HUGE fish breaks the surface.  Thrashing rapidly back and forth, this fish is suspended in midair with what looks to be a human hand in its mouth.  The commotion grows as our heroes jump at the bank.  Curiosity and disdain quickly turns to celebration and disbelief as Raymond, the Thick emerges from the river holding a TWENTY-ONE pound catfish!  Excitedly, our heroes jump in the river to grab the two.

As they haul the two on shore, Sir Brook of West and Kiwi run down the bank excitedly, and with a new breath of life, picks up his rod, casts into the river, and yells to his Brothers to do the same.  Raymond, the Thickness continues to count the weight of the fish, while our heroes suddenly find their luck in catching and reeling in a copious amount. 

The last few minutes are upon them.  The nets continue to bring in large amounts of small fish while our heroes reel in between one and three pound fish.  Raymond, the Thick begins the countdown.  Within the last thirty seconds, as night has fallen, the fish have stopped biting.  The last our heroes checked, the were losing to the Nets by a few pounds. 

All of the sudden, with seven seconds left in the the tournament, Sir Brook of West's line began to tug.  “I've got one!” he yells through the banks.  “I've got a fish!” 

Russel of Angel yells through the evening air that it will not count unless he can land it. 

Sir Brook of West, exhausted through the evenings endeavors, begins to reel as quickly as he can.  However, the fish, with the strength of twenty, fights back.  Sir Brook pulls as hard as he can as the time counts down....

Raymond the Thick continues to count.  The clock has reached it's final second.  With one finishing sweep, Sir Brook of West lets out a warriors scream so loud that the lightening seemed to summon through his throat.  He whipped the fishing rod back so fast that thunder shrieked through the air.  The fish flies out of the water, through the cool evening sky, and makes a splash at St George's feet.

“...Time...” Raymond of Thick says.

Our men shout and jump with joy as the final weight of the fish reaches One hundred and Nine, to the Pirates One hundred and eight. 

The Nets held up their end of their bargain.  They left Castle Chesapeake with nothing left but the shirts on their back, heads hung low.  As our men gather the rest of the fish, St George reaches out to Sir Brook of West. 

“Patience, my friend, is how you catch the biggest fish...”

"With the Spurs losing to the Pacers today they drop to 30 - 18 and tie with the Timberwolves for the 3rd seed. 

We are now only 3 games behind them at 26 - 20 with another 36 games left to be played.

With the Timberwolves having had a favourable schedule to begin the season and the Spurs having recently lost Kawhi 'indefinitely' again we may actually have a real shot at catching that 3rd seed before the end of the season.

This would be huge as it would allow us to play a much weaker team in the first round with home court advantage (Blazers, Pelicans, Nuggets or Clippers instead of Timberwolves or Spurs without home court) along with avoiding Golden State in the second round.

Hopefully Presti can work some magic at the trade deadline to bolster our bench and the guys continue to become more consistent as closing this 3 game differential over the season may have a massive impact on our franchise.","We are now only 3 games behind the 3rd seed.

"They had just defeated a squad of yellow shirts.  Lonzo of Laker, under his injured breath, has whispered to Sir Brook of West, he was sent to destroy them under the republic of California.  

The republic of California was home to a devastating group of individuals.  Their names traveled across the land with a tremble of fear when spoke: ""The Warriors.""  With members like Stephen of Curry, Sir Klay, The Snek, and few more, there is reason to be afraid.  Ruling the Republic, they had succumbed to defeat very few times.  Once being to our heroes.

""The Warriors sent you?"" Sir Brook of West asked Lonzo of Laker. 

""Indeed.  But if revenge is what you seek, you must travel East.  Find King James and take him out first.  Only then will the Warriors know you've survived and you're coming for blood.""

King James.  He was a generous King.  His people adored him and have for years.  The rumors as of late have stated he is on a quest of his own.  He was blood thirsty with intent on receiving his 30,000th kill.  If he were to reach this, he would be considered an Elite King. 

This did not bode well with Sir Brook of West.  He rallied his troops and began to travel. 

**********

Sir Brook of West, traveled with few and trusted even less.  His right hand man,  Big Kiwi, always had his back.  Sir Robes was rumored to have some of the quickest hands in the West.  Melo of Knicks, came to them recently with open arms, aiding to join them in their journey. With knowledge of King James, he is definitely an asset.  Lastly, PG of 13.  Nobody really knows where PG is from.  With a slick hairline, and arms the length of the Nile, he must be Alien, however, he claims he too is from the East. 

**********

After days of travel, our heroes breached the hillside.  Once atop the mound, they paused to look over the kingdom.  In the distance they could hear chatter of townspeople.  The clatter of transport over the cobbled stone.  They probably heard cows too.  With shouts of praise directed at King James, they knew this was the kingdom.  The land of Cleve.  Home of King James and his squad of Elite Knights.  

As Sir Brooke of West and his men entered town, they heard commotion.  It sounded as though a celebration was about to take place.  As our travelers continued through town, they were greeted with looks of daggers, hisses and boos, they were being shouted at and spit on.  Big Kiwi, the tallest of the group, looked forward and noticed the Arena, King James' Home, was lit with torch light.  

Picking up pace, the reached the doors.  Guards quickly pushed them in, onwards and upwards to the presence of King James. 

""I have been expecting you"" King James said.  ""I've heard rumors you have come for my head!""

laughter erupts through the arena.

""As you know, I'm few lives short of 30,000...and Lucky for me, my prey has landed in front of me, ready to be taken.""

Our heroes look around.  With hearts racing, adrenaline coursing through their veins, they quickly arm themselves for a battle. 

King James and his men stand up.  They reveal their swords, and charge our heroes...

********** 

Big Kiwi pressed his back against Sir Brook of West preparing for the worst.  Melo of Knicks and PG of13 stood within arms length, while Robes, sword at the ready, walked the perimeter of his squire, fending off anyone that came close.  

With swiping blows, quick jabs, and daggers placed with perfect timing, our heroes were making an impact.  However, King James continued to come back for more. Trade offs between King James and his men kept them fresh and ripe with stamina, but our men refused to back down.  

For every wound Sir Brooke of West received, he delivered 2 more. Melo of Knicks, never let his guard down.  Quietly keeping his stance, when someone drew near, he would swing, and almost never miss.  PG of 13 was a sniper.  With his pole-arm drawn, nobody could come within striking distance of him.  If, somehow, one of King James' men were close enough to do damage to Sir Brook of West, Big kiwi, would reach out with his bear sized hands, and deliver a crushing blow.

A battle that seemed to last for hours...2.5 hours to be exact, finally came to an end.  Our heroes, although damaged, were not phased.  King James and his men, however, lied in agony.  Sir Brook of West slowly limps towards King James who is on his back, gripping his side.  With his  sword drawn, Sir Brook of West looks down at King James. 

Standing over him, Sir Brook of West speaks.  ""You have taken many lives.  You were few away from becoming elite.  You have Killed many of my men, and taken lives of people I was close to.  However, this day, the day we were expected to be you last kill, will forever go down as the day King James has Fallen.""

""You may behead me... as I deserve it.  But know that my Kingdom will never fall"" James Says to him. ""We will be back...and in greater numbers...to take back the pride you have stolen.""

Sir Brook of West looks him in the eyes.  ""I am not taking your head.  I want you to live in the shame you have bestowed upon yourself.  Take your squad elsewhere, for even though we are enemies, I need you alive.  You and your Knights are my stepping stone to defeat the Warriors.  Go now!  Travel to Pop of Vic and do your dirty work there!""

Sir Brook of West drops his sword at King James' side.  The King lay injured, drowning in his tears yet relieved to see another day.  

Sir Brook of West gathers his men and they begin their journey home, unaware that Melo of Knicks neighboring enemy will lay there, waiting for their arrival.

"This is starting to be the new thing, so at the very least, I wanted to offer a different perspective with some fundamental and technical analysis. (Im using bballref for all stats).

**The Roles**

I've mentioned this time and time again. Last year, Carmelo was the #1 option on a team and scored 22.4ppg on 43%. He did this while spending 61% of his time as the SF. He played some stretch 4 in NY, but never spent more than 78% at that position in one season.

This year, we're asking him to change his role. We're not just asking him to be catch and shoot Melo, but he's spending 89% of his time at the 4 spot -- that's the most in his career. Where's he spending the rest of his time? **As a center.** Yes. Melo is playing 11% of his time as a center. ***He has played literally no minutes as a SF.***

We are trying to teach an old dog new tricks right now and it's very hard to come out of those habits when you aren't strict in this process. Melo with the 2nd unit makes him Iso Melo that freezes out his teammates. It also requires you to make a decision with positions...if you keep Melo as the 4 or 5 in the 2nd unit, then where do you play Jerami and Patterson? If you play Melo at the 3, then you're back to messing up teaching an old dog new tricks. And then why play Melo as the 3 when you've got a younger, more athletic and defensive minded 3 in Paul George? This helps continuity. (and really this should be the end of the argument, but we'll keep going).


**Lineup data is inconclusive at best**

There are 2 reasons why I think the data is inconclusive. The first is there are not enough stats for a 5-man lineup where Melo is the only starter. We tend to play him with at least one starter, typically a defensive minded one like Robes or someone who sets him up like Russ, both of which make all their teammates better. It's literally not fair to compare. We can see it with our eyes -- Roberson makes defenses better. Russ makes offenses better for catch and shoot guys. Duh.

One of the top 20 lineups with just Melo and bench has only played 36 minutes total. Melo/Abrines/Ray/Grant/Pat are a +5.5 total. This is a lineup, that in total, has played about .81 minutes a game, or 49 seconds a game. That's the equivalent. They have outscored the opponents then, by .125 ppg. 

The top 3 5-man lineups used are some variation of the starters (wherein it's Robes or Abrines or Ferg). The 4th played lineup is PG with the bench (with Abrines). This unit is a -38.2 total in 85 minutes. Switch Abrines out with Huestis and they're a -26.9 in 51 minutes. I'll agree with you that this isn't working...we don't need a break down of why (but my guess is the bench slows things down and turns into iso-pg and it messes up everything).

**What we need to be doing instead: Playing the all bench lineup.** 

The eye test shows me this is the best bench line up we've got. They have no other choice but to share the ball and they do.

If our best Melo + bench lineup is a +5.5 in 36 minutes and we think that's great, then the all bench unit is +5 in 46 total minutes. (sub in T Ferg for Abrines, they're +21.5 in 30 minutes).

This is a bench that brings energy when our starters are just going thru the motions. Every time you guys complain about the bench, it's the bench lineup with PG. And again, I'll agree that PG shouldn't play, but that the bench unit should play all together. They've spent a total of 76 minutes on the floor and have a better net rating than the team with Melo on the floor. They are a decent group.

Now, I'd play it by match-up. I do think when we play better benches (i.e., Cavs/Warriors/HOU bench with starter quality guys playing), we should play one of the big 3, and that 1 should be Russ.




","Here's why we don't play Melo with the 2nd Unit and what we should be doing instead This is starting to be the new thing, so at the very least, I wanted to offer a different perspective with some fundamental and technical analysis. (Im using bballref for all stats).

**The Roles**

I've mentioned this time and time again. Last year, Carmelo was the #1 option on a team and scored 22.4ppg on 43%. He did this while spending 61% of his time as the SF. He played some stretch 4 in NY, but never spent more than 78% at that position in one season.

This year, we're asking him to change his role. We're not just asking him to be catch and shoot Melo, but he's spending 89% of his time at the 4 spot -- that's the most in his career. Where's he spending the rest of his time? **As a center.** Yes. Melo is playing 11% of his time as a center. ***He has played literally no minutes as a SF.***

We are trying to teach an old dog new tricks right now and it's very hard to come out of those habits when you aren't strict in this process. Melo with the 2nd unit makes him Iso Melo that freezes out his teammates. It also requires you to make a decision with positions...if you keep Melo as the 4 or 5 in the 2nd unit, then where do you play Jerami and Patterson? If you play Melo at the 3, then you're back to messing up teaching an old dog new tricks. And then why play Melo as the 3 when you've got a younger, more athletic and defensive minded 3 in Paul George? This helps continuity. (and really this should be the end of the argument, but we'll keep going).


**Lineup data is inconclusive at best**

There are 2 reasons why I think the data is inconclusive. The first is there are not enough stats for a 5-man lineup where Melo is the only starter. We tend to play him with at least one starter, typically a defensive minded one like Robes or someone who sets him up like Russ, both of which make all their teammates better. It's literally not fair to compare. We can see it with our eyes -- Roberson makes defenses better. Russ makes offenses better for catch and shoot guys. Duh.

One of the top 20 lineups with just Melo and bench has only played 36 minutes total. Melo/Abrines/Ray/Grant/Pat are a +5.5 total. This is a lineup, that in total, has played about .81 minutes a game, or 49 seconds a game. That's the equivalent. They have outscored the opponents then, by .125 ppg. 

The top 3 5-man lineups used are some variation of the starters (wherein it's Robes or Abrines or Ferg). The 4th played lineup is PG with the bench (with Abrines). This unit is a -38.2 total in 85 minutes. Switch Abrines out with Huestis and they're a -26.9 in 51 minutes. I'll agree with you that this isn't working...we don't need a break down of why (but my guess is the bench slows things down and turns into iso-pg and it messes up everything).

**What we need to be doing instead: Playing the all bench lineup.** 

The eye test shows me this is the best bench line up we've got. They have no other choice but to share the ball and they do.

If our best Melo + bench lineup is a +5.5 in 36 minutes and we think that's great, then the all bench unit is +5 in 46 total minutes. (sub in T Ferg for Abrines, they're +21.5 in 30 minutes).

This is a bench that brings energy when our starters are just going thru the motions. Every time you guys complain about the bench, it's the bench lineup with PG. And again, I'll agree that PG shouldn't play, but that the bench unit should play all together. They've spent a total of 76 minutes on the floor and have a better net rating than the team with Melo on the floor. They are a decent group.

Now, I'd play it by match-up. I do think when we play better benches (i.e., Cavs/Warriors/HOU bench with starter quality guys playing), we should play one of the big 3, and that 1 should be Russ.

"1st half was pretty much the old Billy Donovan lineups. Alot of things did not work well. 

Fortunately, Billy Donovan was willing to make adjustments this game.

1) He kept Melo in to play with the bench. George was subbed out, and Melo played the whole 3rd quarter. Sure he got hot, but it was noticeable how great the bench played with Melo.

2) When Melo checked out, the all bench lineup was played again. I don't think the all bench + George is any better, so I admit that this was a good adjustment. Let everyone rest.

3) Patrick Patterson has a nice  3 point shot, he just needs to get consistent open looks. Felton just wasn't able to execute that well tonight. And it was awesome that Billy went with Russ + bench. It's easy for Russ to execute the bench offense since everyone is pretty much a 3 point shooter.

I expect to see this going forward. Some combo of Melo and Russ + bench.

4) Huestis finished the game for OKC instead of Ferguson. 
I noticed George and Melo need help guarding the paint. George shies from contact in the paint, and he doesn't really block shots. Huestis is a great fit for certain matchups to just play aggressive defense and take hits in the paint and try to contend shots.

"Just a ""thinking"" post I guess, because I know it's impossible to keep all 3 here for the majority of their careers. These guys are the few left since I started becoming invested in OKC ( I think Collison is retiring after this season so I didn't include him). 

It has been amazing to see how much these guys have grown, especially Dre and Steve. They were drafted here out of college and for the organization to let one go will feel like a parent abandoning their kids. LoL It has been a joy to see all 3 out there together and their bond seemed to only get stronger with KD leaving. I don't feel like off court chemistry translates on the court 100% of the time with every player, but it clearly has with them.

"Upside reasons for melo to bench:
1. Allows more natural staggering of Russ and Melo - the two scorers, particularly isolation scorers, on the team
2. Manages an older player's (Melo) mins in blowouts and a less conditioned player (also Melo) gets run when other players are fatigued
3. Sets cultural tone that winning matters more than anything

Fake Downside reasons
1. Fewer mins for Melo (who is obv still our 4th or 5th best player): This will only happen in blowout games where we wouldn't need him
2. Melo will get pissed off and check out: And then waive his NTC! The whole point of the Melo trade was to raise our ceiling and lower our floor. Lets double down on that strat and either make him a super sixth man or mess things up for a while, so that we can flip him for some prospects that will help us retool for 2018-19!

"Look at this video of Adams describing how the Thunder defends the PnR: https://streamable.com/a9pno

We literally scheme to allow bigs a lane to the hoop. What the fuck is this shit? This right here is why we give up points to bigs and a big reason why we give up open 3s. 


Because our scheme is to: 

1. Allow them to do what they want in the PnR, get the big man the ball on his way to the paint. At best we have a help defender to stop him (if the defender reacts in time, which they usually don't)

2. Leave a man open in the corner so Roberson or Melo can attempt to cover the paint for the rolling big man.

3. Take our best rebounder out of the paint. 


This has been part of our defensive scheme since Donovan got here, and we've been terrible at defending the PnR that entire time. Why is Donovan so set on this? It's terrible. It gives the other team options to do whatever the fuck they want on offense. We only get by because of Roberson's incredible defense. This is why we suck so much without him, because our defensive scheme only KIND OF works with him.

"I'm a Laker fan and I come in peace. So we just mutually parted ways with Andrew Bogut in favor getting a shooter that we definitely need and I was thinking about potential destinations for him. Two of the spots that would make the most sense are the bucks because they could use a rim protector and OKC. I think he would help you guys out a lot freeing up Steven Adams on defense and just improving your rebounding in general. Plus, he would add on to the great defense you guys already have on the perimeter with Roberson being the fantastic defensive anchor that he is on the wing (get well soon). The only downside of Bogut to me is that he is not great at switching mostly because of how naturally slow he is and I know the Thunder do love them some switching.

"I feel like this seasons is an extremely important one for Russ' legacy . This year is probably the Thunder's best chance at a title if they cant secure Melo/George. Would you all agree? 

Side Note:
Am I the only one who thinks Russ get Lebron like unfair criticism? This is not to say he does not have his weaknesses, but it seems to me like most critiques of Russ are false narratives that have been dragged on from his rookie year. It's like the media chooses to ignore how much his game has changed/improved just in the month of December/January cause it doesn't match their narratives. I get its a somewhat small sample size as well but he can probably play this way for the rest of the season and shoot over 46% by the time the regular season is over.","Russell Westbrook's Legacy I feel like this seasons is an extremely important one for Russ' legacy .

"It's pretty simple, they don't play hard enough against mediocre teams. 

It's not that they aren't capable of getting 3rd seed, I actually think they can beat every team in the league if they got time to gel, and if they played like their life depended on it. But it seems like they don't really give that much of an effort unless it's a top team or a division threat (even then it's sometimes... ""meh""..)

This season OKC has beaten teams like GSW, Rockets, Spurs (although that was a cheap one, but the other one would have been different if the toe wasn't on the line), but at the same time they've lost to Suns, Knicks, Nets, Kings and twice to Mavs. It shouldn't be like that when this team is capable of blowing out those teams, but in the end it all boils down to effort. It's arrogance, and the nonchalant attitude isn't helping. 

Tyson Chandler wanted those offensive boards MUCH more than Adams (or anyone else), and in the first half alone Suns had 20 (!!) out of its 23 second chance points in the first half. That alone is not acceptable. That combined with 57% from FT on a decent volume (21 attempts)? 

I can guarantee you Westbrook doesn't miss FT's like that in a clutch match like GSW, as a matter of fact last game against them he shot 88%. The Rockets game you say? He shot 88% in that game as well. 

Watching how Timberwolves play they want it much more, and they play hard against anyone, both good and bad teams. For that reason alone they are gonna win more games, and because we just show up like ""*meh, Suns whatever issa walkover*"", we're gonna lose more games even though we're capable beating a team like Timberwolves easily.

"""Hawk"" is a set that Billy Donovan has been running more and more each game. Here it is in its entirety (With Roberson being the recipient on this particular possession): 

https://streamable.com/ugiqt

This play puts the ball in Westbrook's hands, gives him options, and lets him make the right decision. Whether it's Russell attacking off the pick and roll (which very few teams in the league can stop):

https://streamable.com/tmt9u

OR hitting George for the 3 off the double screen (where he's shooting a career high 44%):

https://streamable.com/gz5r7

https://streamable.com/mdcf5

OR hitting Melo for a spot-up mid range jumper

https://streamable.com/jv9jf

This play caters to OKC's stars strenghts. Westbrook in the pick and roll, Melo spotting up for midrange after the pick, and George coming off a catch-and-shoot.

Here's Westbrook utilizing the initial PnR to shoot his signature shot, a pull-up J on a dime from 15 feet:

https://streamable.com/5knaq

If the defender overplays on the hedge, Russ still has a lane to do Russ things:

https://streamable.com/ui4ur

This play is also tailor-made for a guy like Paul George, an excellent catch and shoot player who loves to come off of screens and either shoot or attack. If the play is defended well and no options seem open at first, OKC uses Adams as a screener in late shot clock situations so George can get a clean look:

https://streamable.com/9hb2a

If defenders hug up on PG and anticipate the screen, Paul can improvise:

https://streamable.com/030wu

Obviously, OKC still has a lot to figure out. But Billy Donovan seems to be playing to the strengths of the stars and it makes basketball easier for them.

"We've been playing great, this is not to take away from that but just to spitball how to improve this team to get deeper into the playoffs.  
One of the missing parts of this trade scenario is the backup center. 

I believe at all costs Tyson Chandler* (IF he reaches a buyout*) OKC must acquire him be to be the backup center. With his demeanor and his rebounding ability in combination with Adams on the offensive glass is statistically a monster duo.  

That being said here is a trade idea to boost the 2nd team, improve the 3pt shooting, maintaining defense as well reuniting with an old teammate. Enjoy, debate. #whynot?

"I was not surprised, due to his athleticism (which I think is STILL underrated despite what we’ve seen), but Josh Huestis finished with 9 rebounds. 

He got some in the third and fourth quarters, but somebody has to play. I think if he and Terrance Ferguson can continue to show more promise in these games without Roberson, it’s time to try and package Abrines and either Grant/Patterson for the missing piece/s we need to go over the top. 

Huestis has displayed, not only equivalent athleticism as Jeremi Grant, but a much higher BBall IQ. Jeremi Grant goes blank, or is out there over thinking things too often. Josh has a better mid range shot, and a better long ball.  Most importantly HE DOESN’T PLAY SOFT. 

Jeremi could be one of the best 3-D players of this era of basketball but he doesn’t seem to understand the realm his physical ability has placed him in.  He could be THE X FACTOR on this team, but doesn’t want to be. You can’t teach that mentality. But I digress...

I think Huestis is honestly making the better case to be retained over Grant so far. Thoughts?

I was a huge supporter for Patterson but I feel he's really lost a few steps. maybe it's a prolonging injury but right now he's gotta get right man.


I feel like we either need to sign the best center we can or keep Dakari as our center. 2pat just doesn't work at the 5.


would rather use money to keep Grant and huestis together rather than keep 2pat which was crazy to say months ago. 

we're gonna have the most athletic bench of all time with ferg Grant and huestis lol. If Ferg can continue this development this bench and team overall could be infinitely greater.","This may need to be our bench lineup felton

1) I've never seen him say the Lakers.  Just Los Angeles.  I would crack the fuck up if he went to the Clippers. 

2) he's playing at home tonight and killing it

3) remember, everyone said Blake Griffin was going to trade to OKC so he could play at home. 

4) obviously the key to his success isn't going home, but being around friends and family. He played excellent tonight in front of his parents. So uhh...let's bring his family here 

---intermission----

Holy fuck those dunks from Ferguson!! 

---and were back----

Anyway, PG isn't going anywhere I don't think. Not this year.  I think he'll stay another year or two because of how much he has given and gotten from this team. Whatever he does though, as long as he's up front, I'll support him like 99% of our precious thunder players.","Paul George and the Lakers I love watching the thunder play and Paul George is fun to watch with Melo and Russ.

"Hear me out.... Highly unlikely we make 3rd seed and unlikely we drop to 6th seed, so right now this sets up a GSW vs Thunder 2nd round matchup.

idk about y'all but I want to make the WCF so it increases our chances to keep PG. The best route to doing so is hopefully beating the wolves first round, then second round we play Rockets and it will be an extremely tough and close series imo, but we do matchup better with them than the Warriors and I'm sure everyone would rather we play the Rockets in the 2nd round than the Warriors... As that gives us a better chance to meet PG's criteria of making the WCF.

Though we now have a new head mod, u/Lolsokje, we assure you that this sub will never be governed by a single moderator ever again. All major changes and decisions will be left to a majority group vote as already decided by Lolsokje and the rest of the mod team.

We always encourage you guys to speak up, privately or publicly when you feel there is anything we can improve on with this sub. Hopefully we can get back to focusing on basketball in this sub. I'd like to remind everyone that though we allow almost all civil conversation that doesn't break sub rules to occur unmoderated in META threads, this sub is not for racial and or political debates. It doesn't matter to us what you look like or who you vote for as long as you Thunder the fuck up!

In the interest of full disclosure, I will be deleting all the META posts on this subject as the issue is now resolved and those threads were largely political and aggressive as well as cluttering up the past week on the front page.

We would also like to welcome u/Dixbfloppin93 to the mod team. You may recognize him as the guy who posts the pre and post game threads. I feel he will make an excellent addition to the mod team.

"OKC is ranked 29th in the league in free throw percentage (71.1%). Westbrook is an 81% career free throw shooter, but he's only making  72% of his FTs this year.  Carmelo Anthony (also an 81% free throw shooter) is only making 76.6% of his FTs. I understand that there are different factors that would affect this, but I think this is an important issue that really needs to be addressed. [In the clutch, OKC is only shooting 61% from the line](https://stats.nba.com/teams/clutch-traditional/?sort=FT_PCT&dir=-1). Shooting in general seems to be an issue, as they're in the bottom half of the league in field goal percentage and three point percentage (in the clutch). We've definitely improved in December, but free throw shooting is something that also needs an improvement.","What's up with OKC's free throw shooting? OKC is ranked 29th in the league in free throw percentage (71.1%). Westbrook is an 81% career free throw shooter, but he's only making  72% of his FTs this year.  Carmelo Anthony (also an 81% free throw shooter) is only making 76.6% of his FTs. I understand that there are different factors that would affect this, but I think this is an important issue that really needs to be addressed.

He feels like a ring and championship is what every player strives for and it's the ultimate level of success in basketball. I agree with this, but I don't think KD will be as respected given how he left and the team he chose to go to.

"So obviously the refs fucked up the Giannis call at the end. They wouldn't be able to review/overturn if they said he was out anyways. But what really annoyed me is how the refs changed the clock from .8 to 1.4 without reviewing. Like the ref said, ""oh, I know it should be 1.4!"" That itself warrants a review, right???? (gives OKC a free timeout, which probably doesn't do much but allows them to organize?)

What really annoyed me was the lane violation hypocrisy in the last minute. Take a look at these [screenshots](https://imgur.com/gallery/aoIJ9)

How does no lane violation get called on Middleton for the Westbrook miss? He's in the fucking lane! And then, my favorite, how does Anthony get called for a lane violation when Giannis is on the opposite end ALREADY BOXING OUT BEFORE IT'S LEFT ADAMS HAND?!?

There was no consistency in the lane violation calls and it felt like they were boning OKC on purpose. Not a fan of either team, but it was so annoying and I honestly hate watch the NBA so I can complain about this shit.

"As a lifetime knick fan, who’s suffered through many terrible coaches; I find Coach Donovan incredibly intelligent. I’m in it this year with Carmelo Anthony, who’s been the best player on the Knicks for seven years. Phil Jackson ruined his chance at a ring in New York. But now this OK3 got together and I see them ultimately winning a championship. 

I went to the game when Me7o came back and watching both teams play was incredible. 

Back to Donovan. This guy knows what he’s talking about. He’s not like other coaches I’ve experienced with NYK. Fisher, Rambis and Horneack who say the same thing. “Players have to play in the system,” or “there wasn’t enough effort.”

Billy actually pinpoints micro problems in the game. He’s targeted Melo spotting up. Problems in the third quarter. Sharing the ball because he wants the other team to scramble so we get open shots. He’s clearly a former college coach because he is so keen on fundamentals. However so far I would say he has mastered the NBA level. 

He knew he needed to get this team to be efficient on defense and offense. He targeted defense first, perhaps realizing these players would be able to click quicker on the offensive end given their talents. Now this has become the most entertaining team to watch in the NBA. Steals and fast breaks. Lobs. A Kiwi. 

Cheers to Billy Donovan.

"1) I now own 2 Russell shirts and a jersey and don’t have to worry about them going out of style

2) EVERY SINGLE LOSS would be accompanied by a million threads about how Russ and George are going to the Lakers. ESPN would have so much content about it’d be ridiculous.

You have no idea how annoying it was to hear, from the OKC haters, that PG is literally here just to convince him to go to the Lakers with him. That rumor was put to rest before the season even started thank god. 

3) No distractions. Every game would be about feee agency and people would speculate every time we loss and hell, everytime we won too to talk about how he was staying or leaving.

4)He’s here for better or worse. He trusts Sam to the point where he’s spending the rest of his prime with us. And we will love every minute of it.

5) Also doesn’t hurt that the guy PG was so excited to play with is already locked in, and it should help in the free agency decision. 

Happy Russell Westbrook day!

"Minumum 25 games. (remove that and Milos Teodosic is 1st in the league with his 7 games played)

Obviously win shares are dependant on team defense which is probably why all 3 are in the top 3. There are a couple of things that I think this is indicative of so far this season.

#1) Andre Roberson and Paul George are First Team All defense:
Were the season to end now they would surely be first team, either both as forwards or with Robes as a guard and PG as a forward. Both player's stats much up with the eye test. They are the two best defenders on a team that leads the league in defensive rating as well as forced shot clock violations. For all their offensive woes this year, both are using up that energy on the other side of the court it seems

#2) Russell Westbrook is at least an average defender this year:
Russell Westbrook has been playing defense this year. similar to Harden, there are various clips of him from early this season where he would seem to fall asleep on defense. However, he is second in defensive win shares and also is 4th in the league in steals. another interesting defensive hustle stat is that he leads the league in balls recovered. He manages to stay with his man for the most part and has been using that athleticism wisely. For all his faults that he hasn't improved on, having watched every game this year, defense is one of the key areas where he has most definitely improved","Robes, Russ and PG are 1st, 2nd and 3rd respectively in Defensive Win Shares this season Minumum 25 games.

"Westbrook is a known commodity. We all know how he plays and acts. Melo is a known commodity. A great scorer but not usually willing to be second fiddle. Paul George is a bit more unknown just due to not knowing what he needs to be in this offense. Purely shooter or a aggressive scorer. 

So all these pieces are on the table and it seems pretty clear that they are not going to change. Billy Donovan has to step in and create the chemistry the team needs. Just some order of an offense.

Whatever he laid out in the off-season is not fulfilling the need. Adjustment is key. But moreso, be the authoritative head coach and give an order.

Russ drives and hits PG. Shoot it or create a move, not there? Melo post, look for Adams. Russ cuts and gets the ball back. Drives and feeds to someone or finishes. This is a elementary offense that I'm not saying the Thunder should use. But there has to be some element of hierarchy with the ball.

I don't expect the Thunder to compete with GS this early, but I did expect them to be much better than they do now. ","No hate. Really think Donovan has to bring the team together.

"Just curious to hear a range of opinions on our acquisitions from the off season.
Personally, I was shattered to have lost kanter in the first place, and Melos output just depresses me atm. 
PGs offensive inconsistency is very frustrating but I still love him, love his defensive efforts, him and robes together I've really enjoyed. 
I was convinced through the first 20 odd games that Felton was one of our 3 best players lol. Low key great signing. 
And Pattersons looking to finally be finding his groove after coming off surgery in the off season. Been very good on both ends in recent games. If he can sustain this form he's gonna be huge for us.","What are your thoughts on Melo, PG, Felton & Patterson so far?

"I know a lot of people are going to want to say Russ and I love Russ, but please try to be unbiased. Lol If you genuinely feel like he is the most well rounded player, I would love to hear why.

I started thinking about this after the post on Dre. He's an elite defender, but his offense isn't where it could be. This made me think about how many players in the league are actually superb at both and what we could consider a near perfect player. I guess I feel like there aren't many of those. Imo, most guys ""specialize"" in one area (y'all can chime in on this too if you want). Obviously a player's position and overall role on the team factors into what they do. But, what would you consider a well rounded player?

I want to have a discussion for the folks who are Pro-Melo-on-the-bench.

To me, it makes no sense and you create a bench that's ridiculously one-dimensional. At least right now, we can have Melo be a threat of being a catch and shoot guy that spreads the floor who also has a nice iso-post game. 

On the bench, he just turns into iso-melo. Guys like Abrines/Huestis will probably see the ball even less. Is there anyone who thinks Melo goes to the 2nd unit to become Olympic Melo?

I'm not going to lie, a starting unit with Russ/Robes/PG/2Pat/Adams has me licking my chops in terms of defense and ball movement. I just think moving Melo to the bench easily turns our bench into poop.

"When Roberson is on the floor, the rest of the team is having to play with half of the court. On offense, f he’s on the left wing, the left side of the court is useless.  THIS IS WHEN THE OFFENSE BECOME THE MOST STAGNANT!! Melo, PG13 and Russ aren’t passing to him wide open when they know a contested shot from one of them is more probable of going in, and I don’t blame them!! He airballed a wide open three last night (see link below, look at how crowded the other guys are) - no shooting guard who makes it to the NBA should ever airball a wide open three, especially as often as he does! It’s ridiculous. Melo will willingly give the extra pass if abrines is there. Did it the other night and it looked great. 

Last night he had a fast break coming off a steal, but was to scared to attack the basket and draw the foul (against a JJ Reddick, if I recall correctly) because he didn’t want to go to the foul line and air ball free throws! Then, to make matters worse, the rest of the guys get double/triple teamed. OR, his defender is allowed to roam free and clog passing lanes. He isn’t a shooting guard - he’s a security guard. Other teams are EASILY able to hide their worst defender because we are playing the worst offensive player in the entire NBA. 

Roberson should be a situational starter only, against teams like Houston, GSW, etc. If there’s not a scoring threat for Roberson to guard, its ludicrous having him start. 

I want to see Heustis get more burn! He’s a more than capable defender. He was doing a great job when he was covering Ben Simmons the other night. Also, he does what Roberson doesn’t, HE HITS HIS SHOTS. He’s been knocking down all his open looks this season. Idk if presti is trying to keep his value down so they can resign him for the long term for cheap, bc he said he wants to stay here and they declined his player option. 

Either put Patterson in at the 4 and slide Melo to the 3, or swap Roberson with Heustis/Grant/Abrines and quit letting him collect dust on the bench.

Roberson is a great defender, but so are PG13, Heustis and Grant. The amount of points that Roberson keeps the other team from scoring is heavily outweighed by the points that he continues to cost the offense. It results in poor ball movement and difficult shots/crowded lanes. 

In conclusion, he does a great job on players like Harden and Klay. But if he’s guarding an average scorer, put somebody out there. Those are nights when we need scoring more than defense, because we have other capable defenders on the floor. Last season, he was the one we counted on to guard the wing defenders. This year, Paul George is more than capable of tackling that task. 

Quit blaming Russ, Melo and PG13 for the offensive issues when it’s clear the guy shooting 21% from 3-point land (WHILE TAKING WIDE OPEN SHOTS) and 38% FT shooting (WHICH ARE STILL WIDE OPEN SHOTS) is the reason for the problems in the offense. 

Until Billy benches his ass, this team will struggle with fluid ball movement.  Hard to move the ball and great open looks when the other team is playing with an extra player. GET HIM OFF THE FLOOR. 

I have no problem with Billy tinkering with the rotations, because that’ll pay dividends come playoff time. Scotty Brooks used to never adjust his lineups, we were too predictable and it was a problem.

"- Good to see Paul George still locked in from a defensive standpoint. I'm not sure if he's going to have to just end up being the KG of the unit, because he's really efficient, but I like to see him still engaged when he's not getting shots or making shots.

- 2PAT is back and he is a thing. He's everything we wanted him to look like and he's competent defensively. I'd even like to see him play a bit more with Steven Adams when he gets back.

- Russ shot 50% from the field tonight. Goes to show that him shooting =/= OKC winning. I am with him when he says he doesn't give a damn about his percentages, he just wants to win.

- Did you see that DUNK doe? Good Lord.

- Carmelo in a catch and shoot capacity is going to work. We just need him and the team to buy in to the idea that that's the best way for him to play.

- Always a pleasure to see Mr. Thunder. He rots away on the bench but I always feel like he contributes positively every time he plays.

Last night, as with a number of other games, the Thunder have looked to score freely and move the ball early in the game, but when the game gets close in the 4th quarter, revert back to iso ball and shoot poorly.

It seems like Russ gets tunnel vision, not seeing open players on the perimeter and starts jacking up jump shots with varying degrees of success.

"So tonight might be the biggest gut check of this young season. We will face an emotional opponent for Melo after a triple overtime victory. On paper we should win this one, but I guess we'll largely see how our conditioning is. Big night for us and I think it's safe for us to get hyped about a turned corner if we put up a W tonight. We're 7-2 in our last nine games. There's a lot to be positive about.

"We've all been mentioning that Russ looked a little bigger coming into the season and how it could be affecting his shooting. People have also said he's a dad now and likely spent most of the summer with his son rather than working out/training. I told someone in a thread yesterday I would post part of an interview where Russ briefly mentions it: 

Interviewer: It looked to me like you came into training camp a little bigger, though.


Russ: ""Yeah, I definitely did. That was either dad strength or me being on my ass, one of the two. But I don't know if it's fully kicked in yet. My son only goes to a few games, but I feel like when he comes, I get excited that he's there. Although he was asleep yesterday.""

Okay... I'll start by saying that I just found out about this Sub when I found it recently (I am new-ish to reddit).

Also, I am a huge Thunder fan living in OAKLAND CA. I wear their colors and apparel to the bar on game days while being surrounded by annoying blue and gold bandwagoners flaunting number 35... And their ridiculous ""The Town"" jerseys.

I endure this awkward self-induced-ridicule with a sense of pride because I know there are other Thunder fans out there around the world who care just as much as I do about their success. 

In fact, I initially became a fan of OKC because of KD! I swore to become a fan of whichever team he was on simply because of how much I respected his game and approach to life.

All that changed last summer when KD left to join the rival team we worked so hard to beat in the previous playoffs. I respect his decision to chase a ring, that just isn't the KD I grew to love. In fact, my passion has since shifted to the Thunder team as a whole!

I stayed loyal as a fan to the Thunder and their brand of basketball even though I have never stepped foot in Oklahoma City. 

Through all this team pride, I was excited to start reading and posting on this Sub when I found it.... Buuuut it turns out that I can't even make some playful jokes on here about the team's performance without getting down-voted to oblivion. 

All I really want to say is this: Calm The F*** Down. We all care about the team, and everyone needs to learn to take a little joke.

"tl;dr  BD is a damn hustler

I've tuned in to every game this season with the exception of the first three.  Every game has been different.  Some nights, PG is on fire.  Tonight, Melo was on fire.  Every night, our defense is fucking awesome.  Some nights we win, some nights we lose, but it never fails that we blow a lead in third quarter whether we come out to win it or lose it afterwards. 

Except for one game.  The one game where BD told the guys ""go out there and give it all you've got."" and they did.  They put the warriors in their place and made it look easy.  

Because it is. 

Billy Donovan can't let other teams in on how well we can actually play. Otherwise they would study us.  If we played to our fullest potential every game, ran the same plays, shot the same shots, then we would never keep the other teams guessing about how we will play in the upcoming game.  BD comes in with his ""I'm new here"" attitude until it really matters;  The Playoffs...

So what is he doing?  He's telling the big three, Westbrook, Melo and PG, AND ONLY the big three, to fuck it up.  When we're ahead, he tells them to pull back and iso.  When we're behind, he tells them to close the gap and all of the sudden, they pass the ball and heat up again.  When it's close, he tells them to either stay behind and miss shots that the big three are KNOWN to make, or to go ahead and win by two. That's why our defense is tremendous, but our offense fluctuates, and why the big three's numbers are so fucking weird this season, but we are still winning games. 

HOWEVER, there are outside factors such as fatigue, injuries, actual missed shots, etc.  They are, after all, still human. But I think BD is going to allow 15 on purpose losses, then tell them to go out there and play. 

Tonight's win against the 6ers is a perfect example.  They were crushing it.  Especially Melo.  What happened when we took too big of a lead?  Westbrook all of the sudden stops passing to Melo. Then overtime got a little out of hand and it was almost an accidental loss.  However, Robes wasn't in on the secret, so he went for it, got the lay-up, and our two points.  PatPat came through with a huge block, and it was finally game over.  Everyone can breathe.

"I still can't get over how Indiana treated PG on his return.  I wish I could ask every single Pacers fan in the arena last night why they booed him. It felt like many of them were doing it, because it was the it thing to do. I saw a sign calling PG a snake and cupcake. I don't understand how PG is a snake when he handled the situation as professionally as he could have. He didn't blindside them. 

I see a lot of fans saying we're being hypocritical because we boo KD. I don't think other fans will ever understand the magnitude to what KD did to us. It's unfair to group PG in with that. 

And I also saw a comment saying that if someone just listened to the audio of how Pacers fans treated PG, they would swear it was the game where KD returned to OKC. I mean they could have at least been original and not call PG a snake and cupcake. Lol

I understand that Billy Donovan has stressed that defense has to be the identity for this team and playing at a faster pace can often detract from a team's defensive prowess, but I just don't think any team with Russell Westbrook should rank in the bottom half of the league in pace. 



Honestly, Westbrook isn't a great scorer and is rather inefficient in the halfcourt. I love the Westbrook-Adams pick and roll and the occasional Westbrook post-ups and pull-ups, but apart from that, I think he has looked a little bit uncomfortable this year as a scorer in the half-court. He flourishes when he's going downhill in the fastbreak, drawing fouls, and making the pull-up midrange jumpers on the break when the defense is on its heels. I feel like we've gotten away from that this year. The advantage of Westbrook being a great rebounder is that he can immediately push the ball, which we haven't done as much of this year. 



I think PG and Melo complement Westbrook well on the fastbreak as both, especially Melo, are great trailer-three shooters. Additionally, Roberson gets a lot more involved on offense when we're running the break as he really isn't much of a factor offensively in the half-court. We are still scoring well on the fastbreak despite not pushing the ball as much showing that we're just not utilizing one of our strengths for whatever reason.



In the halfcourt, I think we're trending in the right direction a little bit as of recently, but with the firepower we have on offense, I really think we have to play to our strength's, which historically has been playing at a fast pace. 



My thoughts 27 games in offensively is that our halfcourt offense is looking better. But moving forward, I really want to see Westbrook push the ball a little more, especially when we have Roberson on the court (as our halfcourt offense and spacing is noticeably worse with Roberson), and in the halfcourt, I'd love to see us use Paul George more as a playmaker rather than just a spot-up shooter, because he's a lot more than that. Last year, he was so good in the pick and roll with Myles Turner, and we've occasionally tried the George-Adams pick and roll, and their timing is sometimes off as expected, but I think it can really develop nicely. 



Basically, I'd like to see us rely a little more on PG in the halfcourt to take some pressure off Westbrook who's game really isn't as suitable for the halfcourt, and let Russell do more of his damage in the fastbreak when he pushes the pace.

This was a good win. There are some positives especially from the bench to take from this game. When our big 3 get a rhythm this team is going to be scary good. I’m from Oklahoma and have been riding with this squad since 08-09. Through the good and the bad this year I’m going to ride it out with them. I have the utmost faith that these guys will be able to pull off a strong season. ,Who is with me? This was a good win. There are some positives especially from the bench to take from this game.

""*The one thing I know in talking to those guys is, has our ball movement at times not been gret? Yes. But they're making a very conscious effort to move the ball.*

*My opinion, I think this is a huge adjustment for all those guys and the fact that sometimes they go possessions, whether free, four, five, six, seven, without ever touching the ball and now all of a sudden it comes back to them on the eight and they're open?* 

*For them in their careers, they've never had to do that before. That's a little bit different. The ball's always come back to them.* 

*I'm not saying they shot it every time, but probably pretty much the ball was in their hands, they were making a play, making a shot, but they knew it was eventually coming back and I think that's an adjustment for those guys.*

*I think for Carmelo in particular, sometimes the ball gets hopped around and it finds him at the 3-point line open, but he hasn't touched it in four or five trips.*

*Now, that's something he has to get better at, because he's a pro, he's been unselfish, but I think that is the biggest thing. They've never, ever had to do a lot of this before because they were so responsible to carry teams.* 

*That's one thing I look at in the shooting percentages, they have not shot the ball very well. It's not because they're getting really terrible looks and every shot's forced. That's not the case*.""","[Young] Billy Donovan also gave his theory as to why the shooting numbers are so inconsistent, and I thought it was really insightful and smart: Link to tweet: https://twitter.com/royceyoung/status/941164919336169472

"Please stop disregarding him this season as some player who doesn't care and just throws up whatever to the rim. Yes he hasn't been shooting well at all. 

But take tonight for example. 3 for 17 from the floor, that has to get better. But the man had 17 rebounds and 12 assists. It seems this sub has just been throwing him to the curb as if he doesn't go out there every night and pour his heart out on the floor. He cares more than any single one of us.  He knows he isn't shooting well. But he still goes out there and plays with intensity second to none. Don't forget everything he's done for this organization just because he isn't putting up 30 points every single game. He's still averaging over 9 assists and rebounds per game. Give him the respect he deserves. Every game thread I see oh here's Russ again, and forcing shots again is Russ. There is no one tougher on Russ than himself.

"With the poor start we've had to the season everyone has been looking for reasons as to why its happening. Whether it be Russ' lack of movement off ball, too much ISO, bad coaching, Melo starting. I think that with everyone so desperate to find reasons to explain what's going on, people have over-thought/over-analysed the situation.

&nbsp;

Russ has played the same way all of his career and has had success, reaching a finals as well as almost beating GSW a couple of years ago (I still believe if we didn't choke that lead we'd have won the championship) and Donovan has shown that he can take a team that far.

&nbsp;

At the start of the season the issue was that the offense was stagnant, we were taking bad shots because we couldn't create good looks. Recently I've noticed that's no longer an issue, we're getting good looks but just aren't making them. This is most likely due to confidence issues caused by our early season woes, but progress has most definitely been made.

&nbsp;

Tonight the big 3 shot horribly. Russ shot 3-17, PG shot 3-14 and Melo shot 4-14. If they shot at their usual efficiency it would have been a complete blow out. This applies for most losses we've had this season (especially in recent weeks.) The same applies to 2Pat and Abrines who're both shooting below career average FG% (Patterson is extremely under, shooting at almost a 10% lower rate.)

&nbsp;

All this team needs is to regain confidence, and we've got plenty of time to do so, we just need to win some games on the bounce and build up some momentum. By the time we reach the play-offs I'm certain we will be ready to compete with anyone. So enough of wanting to trade players away and give up on the season already, as frustrating as it may be lets just be patient. It only makes sense that things are going to get much, much better.","Why I'm super SUPER confident that this team will turn out good With the poor start we've had to the season everyone has been looking for reasons as to why its happening.

"Kind of a long post, but bear with me.... Recently it seems like people on here love to point to that season under Donovan as the benchmark for the Thunder's success in this new system. But taking a look back on it all, are we remembering it more favorably than we realize? 




- During the 2015-2016 season, we finished 3rd in the WCF with a record of 55-27. However, 16 of those 27 loses came from the Thunder blowing a 4th quarter lead with KD and Westbrook at the helm. 




- Everyone was calling for BD's head at one point or another for his mismanagement of the team's rotations during the regular season. To add on to that, the Thunder were blown out in game 1 of the 2nd round series against SA. How did the team respond?.. BD went big against SA and outcoached Pop the remaininder of the series and eventually took a 3-1 lead of GSW before losing out. 





- At the moment, a lot of NBA fans (in general) seem to think of KD as a the key piece to the Thunder's success in 2015-2016. They see him having a perfect fit in GSW and all the success he's having. But reading back on this article, KD wasn't the one pushing for ball movement... ""So who is to blame for these terrible finishes is it Billy Donovan? Russell Westbrook? Kevin Durant? Truth is everyone on the Oklahoma City Thunder is to blame for their poor execution which has led to a lack of identity. Watching the Oklahoma City Thunder play it looks like a pickup game where everyone is trying to score individually. Collectively there is no group conscious effort.

The team fails to run proper sets or get into a certain flow of their offense part of that is Billy Donovan not introducing complicated sets and Russell Westbrook speeding down trying to get the first available shot. If it is not Westbrook being ball dominant then we have Kevin Durant jacking up shots. The team concept is very weak in the OKC locker room and it is sad because they have a ton of talent."" http://www.hoopsjunction.com/responsible-oklahoma-city-thunder-blowing-leads/#sthash.0Hp9CTL7.dpbs






All of this to be said, it appears BD's system takes time to implement correctly during the regular season. However, the ball movement on this Thunder team is light year's ahead of where it was during the 2015-2016 season. Things will pick up, and shots will eventually fall but to be honest we don't need to do much more than get to the 6th or 7th seed.





Assuming the Rockets and Spurs finish 2nd and 3rd respectively, the Thunder's best bet for advancing through to the WCF would be to take the 6th/7th seed to match up against them on the way to play GSW. Right now, the Thunder operate best when we can play our 'small' ball lineup of Russ/Robes/PG/Melo/Adams as we don't have the depth at C to play bigger consistently. But this small ball lineup is the exact lineup it takes to defend teams like Houston. Getting to the 4th/5th seed and having to play Minn/NO/Den wouldn't put our team at an advantage matchup wise like it would if we finished the season at 6th/7th and played Houston and then SA before we took on GSW.

"I get it.  We all imagined a LeCoast to the 3 seed and had images of potentially taking down the Warriors on the way to a shot at the chip dancing in our heads.  But, even the most rational heads and biggest Melo haters couldn't have predicted it would look this bad.  And bad is mostly what it has looked, because the reality is we are 12-14 and in 9th place with 56 games left in the season.  Going 36-20 from here on out would still likely catch us at least a 6 seed, and that is highly attainable.  

I think the biggest points of conflict for the fans right now is; Billy Donovan, Russell Westbrook/Carmelo Anthony (rotating daily), and the bench.  

&nbsp;

1.Billy Donovan

While the focus of dissent for most of the season seemed to rotate between Melo, Westbrook, and Donovan, it seems that most fans have settled on Donovan as the main reason for our struggles.  The main complaints are that he; doesn't have an NBA level offensive system, doesn't have the personality to coach at the NBA level, Can't manage big egos, and he has poor rotations.  

*     A.  ""Billy Donovan doesn't have an NBA level system""

People complaining about Billy Donovan is nothing new.  I found [this fantastic post](https://us.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/3toqec/donovans_offense_or_why_westbrook_is_not_the/) from a couple of years ago while trying to find an old post of mine.  It links to [this collection of BD plays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5QhW-I5N0c).  You can also find a breakdown of his offense [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj4PIYuDe4c) and [here](https://bballbreakdown.com/2015/05/02/billy-donovan-brings-spread-pick-and-roll-offense-to-okc/).  

After digging pretty deeply into it, I have to agree with this criticism, BUT I can see why the Thunder hired him, which I will expand on in a moment.  If you watch the videos I linked above you will notice a very big similarity between the offense he ran in Florida and the offense her runs here.  It was very heavy on the Pick and Roll, with many plays running off a 1-5 high pick and roll looking for a switch to iso off of.  It was a lot of simple off ball movement with little to no off ball screening.  It was catered to having superior talent on the perimeter and abusing that talent creating mismatches off switches into iso's and penetrate-dish type plays.  Because it looked to iso of mismatches, it had a tendency to stagnate and bog down against superior defenses.

Does any of that sound familiar?  It should, because its the exact same offense he runs here.  I can completely understand why they got him though.  The plan was to run this offense with WB/KD, probably the two best iso creators in the league.  We can see how well it excelled in the playoffs when he was able to utilize all the weapons we had in different and creative ways.  I don't think hes a bad coach to be honest.  He can be quite crafty and clever.  I do think that our lineup in the 15-16 season was perfect for him though, and maybe we don't have enough talent now.  I can also see how they imagined Melo and PG thriving in this system.

*     B.  ""Billy Donovan doesn't have the personality to coach in the NBA/Manage superstar egos""

It is hard to argue with this one as well.  We all know about the infamous KD tweet throwing Donovan under the bus.  I don't necessarily think it was fair given the opportunity the team had under Donovan that season, but just that KD would even think that isn't a good look.  I really need to find this clip, but I remember Donovan getting onto Westbrook for a dumb foul early in the season/preseason and Westbrook just looked at him like a media member and gave a thumbs up.  I saw a post on here, and Steven A said it, where Melo called off a substitution.  Things like that aren't a good look.  

I also don't like his lack of emotion on the court and endless positivity with the media.  I think part of that comes from College.  You have a much shorter leash as a coach and protecting the ""children"" is a much bigger issue.  In the NBA you can definitely be more open, but you also have to worry about the Ego part.  That is the balance they must keep, but I think the player respect coaches who will get fired up and tell it like it is when necessary.  Again, on this aspect, I can totally see why they hired him.  He seems like the prototype for what ownership would want from a head coach personality wise.

*     C.  ""Billy Donovan has terrible rotations""

This is only here because it is kind of dumb.  Our bench has been pretty bad overall and is a general complaint I see constantly, but then Donovan gets dumped on for rotations.  Well yea, some of the rotations are bad because our bench is bad.  The regular season is all about figuring out what you are going to do in the playoffs.  You have to experiment.  You have to throw everything you can against the wall to see what sticks.  Most of it has slid straight down.  Our bench has one pure shooter with no D, a spot up shooter forced to play 5 where he has no D, a serviceable backup 1, a high energy defensive guy with no jumpshot who can hit straight lines to the basket, a couple of rookies, and guys like Slingler who have devolved into /NBA memes.  The rotations aren't going to be great, but we need to figure out what might be good now.

&nbsp;

2.Russell Westbrook/Carmelo Anthony

Lets face it.  Both of them are playing like hot garbage.  That is absolutely fair to say.  Westbrook has been able to receive a pass for all his flaws because of everything he brought to the table, but when hes not making mid range jumpers, and he can't finish at the rim, and he isn't drawing fouls, and he isn't making free throws, and hes shooting threes at a career high rate.... Yea, it is that bad.  You almost hope hes playing through an injury just as a way to explain how bad it has been.  I definitely think something is wrong with one of his knees.  He jumps notoriously high on his jump shots and he is consistently missing short.  I think hes not getting the same pop hes used to, hes shooting later in his jump than hes used to, and his shots are coming up shorter than hes used to.  It isn't good.  Hes never been a great finisher at the rim, but hes been especially bad this season and hes not getting foul calls.  I almost hope its an injury, because if this is peak Russ, we are in for a long couple of years.  Honestly, I want to say pretty much the same thing for Melo.  The difference is, Melo doesn't jump high on his jumpers.  He barely leaves the floor and its smooth as butter.  His shot has looked fine to me, as little as I have paid attention to that.  Melo is pretty much the prototype for players games who age well.  Hes never relied on athleticism.  He has struggled to score in the paint, which is a reflection of his age, but hes also been getting no calls while getting mauled.   

As depressing as that all was, if everything is fine, they almost have to start playing better at this point.  They are playing so far under the median that it feels unsustainable, like bizzaro on fire.  If we were hitting high quality open looks at a normal level we would have won 3-4 more games easily.  It could be as many as 5-6 games really.  We could just as easily be 15-11 and everyone would feel fine.  I know that isn't the reality, but its just something to think about for hope.  I think we have started to move the ball better, and we are getting open shots, and they have to start falling.  

&nbsp;

3.The Bench

I addressed most of this in the rotations part but we have to look at the facts.  The bench hasn't been great, and you can look to the composition of the team for reasons.  We drafted Sabonis to be the backup 5 when we inevitably got rid of Kanter.  Kanter was a piece of a different puzzle that could still put up numbers, but wasn't really in the future.  I don't really think McDermott was ever in our plans for the future.  Those are two pretty big components of our bench that we gave up.  We picked up as much talent as we could.  Felton and PPatt were big offseason signs, but weren't part of the plan.  Felton has fit, but PPatt is playing stretch 5 on a recovering knee and can't thrive in those conditions.  Grant is basically Roberson 2.0.  Abrines is a defensive liability, and hasn't proven to be a consistent shooter yet.  That is pretty much it for serviceable members of our bench.  We saw what Collison, Singler, and Ferguson have done with their limited minutes this season, and it hasn't been pretty.  We desperately need to make a move.  It also brings to question why we are spending money on singler and collison if they can't be a positive on the court at this point in their careers.  

&nbsp;

4.The Conclusion

Okay, so what does all of this mean?  Well, it means that there is hope.  Billy Donovan isn't completely incompetent, though it's likely at this point he isn't some hidden savant either.  We can look to his success in the playoffs, in his first season with a roster he was hand picked to lead, as hope for his ability to pull this all together.  Westbrook can be significantly better.  He doesn't even have to shoot better, he just has to play more fundamental basketball.  If he toned it down, moved off ball, cut, set screens, and made more solid passes, he would already be better without scoring.  That aint Russ so at the least we can expect him to shoot better.  Melo is an old dog who might not be able to learn new tricks.  Its hard to blame Donovan for not being able to handle this one.  Melo will have to accept the position hes in at this point of his career and really be comfortable with it.  Hes shown flashes of accepting a more role player role, but hes also shown flashes of completely rejecting that.  Similar to Russ, at the least we can expect him to shoot better. 

&nbsp;

tl;dr

Donovan kind of is the problem, kind of not.  The players are mostly following his system.  Westbrook has been really bad, could change fundamentals, but will likely just find a way to shoot better.  Melo has been really bad, could change fundamentals, but will likely just find a way to shoot better.  An achievable outlook is 36-20 to finish the season.","Talking about Billy Donovan, WB/Melo, and the bench I get it.

Going 36-20 from here on out would still likely catch us at least a 6 seed, and that is highly attainable.  

I think the biggest points of conflict for the fans right now is; Billy Donovan, Russell Westbrook/Carmelo Anthony (rotating daily), and the bench.  

&nbsp;

1.Billy Donovan

While the focus of dissent for most of the season seemed to rotate between Melo, Westbrook, and Donovan, it seems that most fans have settled on Donovan as the main reason for our struggles.  The main complaints are that he; doesn't have an NBA level offensive system, doesn't have the personality to coach at the NBA level, Can't manage big egos, and he has poor rotations.  

*     A.  ""Billy Donovan doesn't have an NBA level system""

People complaining about Billy Donovan is nothing new.  I found [this fantastic post](https://us.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/3toqec/donovans_offense_or_why_westbrook_is_not_the/) from a couple of years ago while trying to find an old post of mine.  It links to [this collection of BD plays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5QhW-I5N0c).  You can also find a breakdown of his offense [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj4PIYuDe4c) and [here](https://bballbreakdown.com/2015/05/02/billy-donovan-brings-spread-pick-and-roll-offense-to-okc/).  

After digging pretty deeply into it, I have to agree with this criticism, BUT I can see why the Thunder hired him, which I will expand on in a moment.  If you watch the videos I linked above you will notice a very big similarity between the offense he ran in Florida and the offense her runs here.  It was very heavy on the Pick and Roll, with many plays running off a 1-5 high pick and roll looking for a switch to iso off of.  It was a lot of simple off ball movement with little to no off ball screening.  It was catered to having superior talent on the perimeter and abusing that talent creating mismatches off switches into iso's and penetrate-dish type plays.  Because it looked to iso of mismatches, it had a tendency to stagnate and bog down against superior defenses.

Does any of that sound familiar?  It should, because its the exact same offense he runs here.  I can completely understand why they got him though.  The plan was to run this offense with WB/KD, probably the two best iso creators in the league.  We can see how well it excelled in the playoffs when he was able to utilize all the weapons we had in different and creative ways.  I don't think hes a bad coach to be honest.  He can be quite crafty and clever.  I do think that our lineup in the 15-16 season was perfect for him though, and maybe we don't have enough talent now.  I can also see how they imagined Melo and PG thriving in this system.

*     B.  ""Billy Donovan doesn't have the personality to coach in the NBA/Manage superstar egos""

It is hard to argue with this one as well.  We all know about the infamous KD tweet throwing Donovan under the bus.  I don't necessarily think it was fair given the opportunity the team had under Donovan that season, but just that KD would even think that isn't a good look.  I really need to find this clip, but I remember Donovan getting onto Westbrook for a dumb foul early in the season/preseason and Westbrook just looked at him like a media member and gave a thumbs up.  I saw a post on here, and Steven A said it, where Melo called off a substitution.  Things like that aren't a good look.  

I also don't like his lack of emotion on the court and endless positivity with the media.  I think part of that comes from College.  You have a much shorter leash as a coach and protecting the ""children"" is a much bigger issue.  In the NBA you can definitely be more open, but you also have to worry about the Ego part.  That is the balance they must keep, but I think the player respect coaches who will get fired up and tell it like it is when necessary.  Again, on this aspect, I can totally see why they hired him.  He seems like the prototype for what ownership would want from a head coach personality wise.

*     C.  ""Billy Donovan has terrible rotations""

This is only here because it is kind of dumb.  Our bench has been pretty bad overall and is a general complaint I see constantly, but then Donovan gets dumped on for rotations.  Well yea, some of the rotations are bad because our bench is bad.  The regular season is all about figuring out what you are going to do in the playoffs.  You have to experiment.  You have to throw everything you can against the wall to see what sticks.  Most of it has slid straight down.  Our bench has one pure shooter with no D, a spot up shooter forced to play 5 where he has no D, a serviceable backup 1, a high energy defensive guy with no jumpshot who can hit straight lines to the basket, a couple of rookies, and guys like Slingler who have devolved into /NBA memes.  The rotations aren't going to be great, but we need to figure out what might be good now.

&nbsp;

2.Russell Westbrook/Carmelo Anthony

Lets face it.  Both of them are playing like hot garbage.  That is absolutely fair to say.  Westbrook has been able to receive a pass for all his flaws because of everything he brought to the table, but when hes not making mid range jumpers, and he can't finish at the rim, and he isn't drawing fouls, and he isn't making free throws, and hes shooting threes at a career high rate.... Yea, it is that bad.  You almost hope hes playing through an injury just as a way to explain how bad it has been.  I definitely think something is wrong with one of his knees.  He jumps notoriously high on his jump shots and he is consistently missing short.  I think hes not getting the same pop hes used to, hes shooting later in his jump than hes used to, and his shots are coming up shorter than hes used to.  It isn't good.  Hes never been a great finisher at the rim, but hes been especially bad this season and hes not getting foul calls.  I almost hope its an injury, because if this is peak Russ, we are in for a long couple of years.  Honestly, I want to say pretty much the same thing for Melo.  The difference is, Melo doesn't jump high on his jumpers.  He barely leaves the floor and its smooth as butter.  His shot has looked fine to me, as little as I have paid attention to that.  Melo is pretty much the prototype for players games who age well.  Hes never relied on athleticism.  He has struggled to score in the paint, which is a reflection of his age, but hes also been getting no calls while getting mauled.   

As depressing as that all was, if everything is fine, they almost have to start playing better at this point.  They are playing so far under the median that it feels unsustainable, like bizzaro on fire.  If we were hitting high quality open looks at a normal level we would have won 3-4 more games easily.  It could be as many as 5-6 games really.  We could just as easily be 15-11 and everyone would feel fine.  I know that isn't the reality, but its just something to think about for hope.  I think we have started to move the ball better, and we are getting open shots, and they have to start falling.  

&nbsp;

3.The Bench

I addressed most of this in the rotations part but we have to look at the facts.  The bench hasn't been great, and you can look to the composition of the team for reasons.  We drafted Sabonis to be the backup 5 when we inevitably got rid of Kanter.  Kanter was a piece of a different puzzle that could still put up numbers, but wasn't really in the future.  I don't really think McDermott was ever in our plans for the future.  Those are two pretty big components of our bench that we gave up.  We picked up as much talent as we could.  Felton and PPatt were big offseason signs, but weren't part of the plan.  Felton has fit, but PPatt is playing stretch 5 on a recovering knee and can't thrive in those conditions.  Grant is basically Roberson 2.0.  Abrines is a defensive liability, and hasn't proven to be a consistent shooter yet.  That is pretty much it for serviceable members of our bench.  We saw what Collison, Singler, and Ferguson have done with their limited minutes this season, and it hasn't been pretty.  We desperately need to make a move.  It also brings to question why we are spending money on singler and collison if they can't be a positive on the court at this point in their careers.  

&nbsp;

4.The Conclusion

Okay, so what does all of this mean?  Well, it means that there is hope.  Billy Donovan isn't completely incompetent, though it's likely at this point he isn't some hidden savant either.  We can look to his success in the playoffs, in his first season with a roster he was hand picked to lead, as hope for his ability to pull this all together.  Westbrook can be significantly better.  He doesn't even have to shoot better, he just has to play more fundamental basketball.  If he toned it down, moved off ball, cut, set screens, and made more solid passes, he would already be better without scoring.  That aint Russ so at the least we can expect him to shoot better.  Melo is an old dog who might not be able to learn new tricks.  Its hard to blame Donovan for not being able to handle this one.  Melo will have to accept the position hes in at this point of his career and really be comfortable with it.  Hes shown flashes of accepting a more role player role, but hes also shown flashes of completely rejecting that.  Similar to Russ, at the least we can expect him to shoot better. 

&nbsp;

tl;dr

Donovan kind of is the problem, kind of not.  The players are mostly following his system.  Westbrook has been really bad, could change fundamentals, but will likely just find a way to shoot better.  Melo has been really bad, could change fundamentals, but will likely just find a way to shoot better.  An achievable outlook is 36-20 to finish the season.",10,11,"Talking about Billy Donovan, WB/Melo, and the bench",https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/7jgyq7/talking_about_billy_donovan_wbmelo_and_the_bench/

With Melo coming off the bench you're spreading the offensive fire power without staggering the minutes too much. Melo has experience with Felton as well, and they might compliment each other.

Kanter/McDermitt would have helped big time with bench scoring. Not having Melo in the starting lineup would make the defense even better and contribute to better ball movement.

But it seems that trading for  Melo help in signing Westbrook long term. ",21,5,The Melo trade was the big mistake,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/7jays2/the_melo_trade_was_the_big_mistake/

"Over a quarter of the season is gone and while the on field stuff hasn't looked good(at all) the betting spread keeps  pointing in the Thunder direction. 

In 25 of the 26 games played for OKC they've been the favourites. Often by a couple of points or so. The one game they were the underdog in was against the Warriors...

So... the  question that pops up in my head - Is this team better when they're the underdogs with no expectations to live up to ?","OKC's been the betting favourite in 25 of their 26 game Over a quarter of the season is gone and while the on field stuff hasn't looked good(at all) the betting spread keeps  pointing in the Thunder direction.

"I think they are trying to get pat more of a rhythm first, but I think that he will be starting by February and I think he deserves it.

He’ll play the stretch 4 role correctly and he’ll actually set screens (I guess melo is too good for off ball screens billy???)

I think our defense will get better and our ball movement will obviously get better because when he’s on the floor the movement is a lot better. It also looks like him and pg have developed a lot of chemistry.

Also melo to the bench would help us more I think because although our bench is better than last year it’s no warriors or Cavs bench his shot creating would be super helpful I think.

MAKE PAT PAT A STARTER COACH!

(Btw I’m not hating on melo he’s one of my favorite players of all time)

"Players who played good:
Adams tried hard. Dwight had a great game.
Paul George always plays pretty sound. He just can't make passes he normally makes because the floor spacing is so bad.

Players who were neutral:
Abrines was relatively neutral. He got some unlucky calls fouling from 3. But he spaced the floor and got fouled. Took good shots. Some of the fouls came from bad rotations... Jerami Grant was playing way too much help defense.

Bad:
Russ... alot of bad defense and bad offense. contested 2s don't make sense.

Melo... again alot of bad shots with contested 2s. 

Melo and Russ are just cancerous.

Anyways here's some clippings I made:

Melo loves to go 1 on 4 instead of kicking it out...

Some bad awareness by Adams.. He leaves Howard when he doesn't need to. George switches and leaves man open for 3. He'll learn..

Wasted shot Russ! Wastebrook...

Moving pick on Russ. but still.. come on just run through the moving screen to call the foul. gotta play harder on D.

"What would be the reason? It wouldn't be to improve our bench, it would be to get him out of the road of PG and Russ right? Because we have tried him with the bench and it's a post fade iso fest. So I see no difference with the bench production as we have evidence of it not working (that's why we decided for PG to be staggered) 

Then that would leave 2 non Shooters and 1 iffy shooter in the lineup. (That's if we play Grant at the 4) or if we start Patterson still not a MASSIVE threat to begin with, then considering his terrible start. So what would be the affects of that? Well Billy said so himself Melo has a bigger impact than just scoring. He gives space for Adams to beast, gives Russ space to drive.... Saw a photo of teams sagging as far off Grant in the corner as they do to Roberson... That's bringing back 16-17 spacing issues.

All y'all want a big change to happen. Melo to the bench doesn't seem like it would make that big of a difference.
