\*DISCLAIMER: This is expecting the Thunder to become the third team in a 3-team-trade with the Nets and Warriors (but since the Nets and Warriors have agreed already, this is more between GSW and OKC). The Warriors can add more teams to the trade to move Russell up until the sign and trade is FINALIZED (which is only possible on JUly 6th, at the earliest.) as long as all parties involved agree. 

&#x200B;

Note: Credit to u/mediuqrepmes for letting me know I forgot to add this in my initial post

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

GSW get:

* Dennis Schroder (15.5 mil)
* Andre Roberson (10.8 mil)
* Abdel Nader (1.6 mil)

TOTAL: 27.9 mil

&#x200B;

OKC get:

* D'Angelo Russell (27 mil)

TOTAL: 27 mil

&#x200B;

This would work out and OKC would likely have to throw in some picks. However, you may ask why either team would do this? Well, here you go:

The Warriors do this because: GSW can get out of being hard capped and force the Thunder into a hard cap scenario. Also, they have consistently suffered from a lack of bench and they might like the prospect of filling the roster with more players who can help Steph Klay and Dray out similar to other players they like while also being able to pick up more free agents and work in Klay's contract comfortably. Roberson could almost replace Iggy's initial role for $7 mil less. Schroder would undeniably work better in a duo with Steph than in a duo with Russ. And the picks, no longer being hardcapped (which allows them to sign Cook, Looney, and Bell back which is huge for them) and Nader (or burton or diallo) are just added compensation.

The Thunder do this because: D'angelo Russell would help with shooting, yet still fill the role Schroder had with Westbrook in being another playmaker. Plus, they get out of paying Schroder 15 mil for being a backup and secure D. Russell as a starting SG and a possible PG for the future for them when Russ starts to drop in athleticism and is likely moved to SG.

&#x200B;

Rosters by the end of this trade **(STARTERS IN BOLD)**:

&#x200B;

OKC:

* **Russell Westbrook**
* **D'angelo Russell**
* **Paul George**
* **Jerami Grant**
* **Steven Adams**
* Likely either Shane Larkin or Raymond Felton
* Terrance Ferguson
* Darius Bazley
* Patrick Patterson
* Mike Muscala
* Hamidou Diallo
* Deonte Burton

&#x200B;

GSW:

* **Dennis Schroder**
* **Stephen Curry**
* **Andre Roberson**
* **Draymond Green**
* **Kevon Looney**
* Shaun Livingston
* Quinn Cook
* Alfonso McKinnie
* Damian Jones
* Jordan Bell
* Jordan Poole
* Abdel Nader
* Treveon Graham
* Shabazz Napier

&#x200B;

This could work out well except for a few things which is where this starts to get very complicated:

1. OKC is now hardcapped
2. OKC is also over the cap with this
3. GSW will likely want a few more pieces

&#x200B;

What's the fix?

&#x200B;

**- FIX #1: More Youthful, Cheap Assets for the Warriors -**

&#x200B;

GSW get:

* Dennis Schroder (15.5 mil)
* Andre Roberson (10.8 mil)
* Patrick Patterson (5.7 mil)
* Terrance Ferguson (2.5 mil)
* Hamidou Diallo (1.4 mil)
* Abdel Nader (1.6 mil)

TOTAL: $37.5 mil

&#x200B;

OKC get:

* D'Angelo Russell (27 mil)
* Shaun Livingston (7.7 mil)
* Quinn Cook (Not sure yet, but covered with OKC's trade exception so doesn't matter)

TOTAL: $37-$45 mil

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Warriors do this because: GSW gets more youthful, cheap, tradable/fluid assets that have shown real potential. They also get rid of Livingston's contract (which is beefier than it should be in all honesty). So, for the price of Quinn Cook, they shed a ""not-so-ideal"" Livingston contract and receive a backup stretch four which they need, Terrence Ferguson (who showed he could play a starting role just fine and is oozing potential), and Diallo (another player dripping potential). I believe this would be enough to make them pull the trigger. It still gives them room to sign their RFAs and sign a couple other core pieces in FA since they are no longer hard capped. (Also, Livingston is likely to retire as soon as this contract expires, so the Warriors receive long-term assets for a year that is largely a wash for them and won;t utilize Livingston's real value)

&#x200B;

OKC does this because: Livingston is still very useful for a team trying to win now and they receive a deadly shooter in the process. Also all the other reasons from before. BUT they still have one major problem here: They are still hardcapped (even moreso than before depending on Cook's contract), so they will still require another move. And that's where fix 2 comes in)

&#x200B;

**- FIX #2: OKC gets in a healthier financial situation by cutting bread(in this case, money) from its diet -**

This part, I have no idea. It is obvious that Adams needs to be dropped to a much cheaper deal here, so I don't know which team can pull this off for us. The only teams that actually have space left are the Lakers, Clippers, Mavericks, and MAYBE the Hawks. So this comes down to a sign and trade of Noel and a first round pick or two seconds to OKC for Adams. This gives OKC space to sign enough Free Agents to meet their roster minimums and possibly even use their MLE to bring in a danny green or Marcus Morris type preferably. If all of that goes through ideally, these will be the final rosters of OKC and GSW:

&#x200B;

OKC:

* **Russell Westbrook**
* **D'angelo Russell**
* **Paul George**
* **Jerami Grant**
* **Nerlens Noel**
* Shaun Livingston
* Quinn Cook
* Darius Bazley
* Min PF/C
* Mike Muscala
* Likely either Raymond Felton or Shane Larkin
* MLE player
* More min players

&#x200B;

GSW:

* **Dennis Schroder**
* **Stephen Curry**
* **Andre Roberson**
* **Draymond Green**
* **Kevon Looney**
* Shabazz Napier
* Alfonso McKinnie
* Terrance Ferguson
* Patrick Patterson
* Jordan Bell
* Damian Jones
* Jordan Poole
* Hamidou Diallo
* Abdel Nader
* Treveon Graham

&#x200B;

GSW POTENTIAL ROSTER WHEN KLAY IS BACK #1:

* **Dennis Schroder**
* **Stephen Curry**
* **Klay Thompson**
* **Draymond Green**
* **Kevon Looney**
* Shabazz Napier
* Terrance Ferguson
* Andre Roberson
* Patrick Patterson
* Jordan Bell
* Alfonso Mckinnie
* Damian Jones
* Jordan Poole
* Hamidou Diallo
* Abdel Nader
* Treveon Graham

&#x200B;

GSW POTENTIAL ROSTER WHEN KLAY IS BACK #1:

* **Stephen Curry**
* **Klay Thompson**
* **Andre Roberson**
* **Draymond Green**
* **Kevon Looney**
* Dennis Schroder
* Shabazz Napier
* Terrance Ferguson
* Patrick Patterson
* Jordan Bell
* Alfonso Mckinnie
* Damian Jones
* Jordan Poole
* Hamidou Diallo
* Abdel Nader
* Treveon Graham

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A few on the warriors side will likely be traded in this case since they are over the roster space max

&#x200B;

That's the only way a direct trade with the Warriors can go down realistically from my understanding. Thanks for reading! Let me know what you think! Do you like this trade (OKC or GSW fans)? If I missed some stuff or you need clarification please let me know and I'll do my best to fix it or explain it!","How realistic is a trade for D'Angelo Russell for the Thunder? Plus, potential secondary moves... So, This is more of a fun ""what if"" scenario, but if this happened that would be an absolute win and would solidify OKC as championship contenders if not make them the favorites to win it all. This could be a little lengthy so I will divide everything into sections so you only look at the interesting parts that YOU care about. I don;t like to beg for upvotes, but this took a long time to figure out with all the cap space issues and other difficulties, so PLEASE UPVOTE IF YOU LIKED THE POST!

"I understand that we are in an emotional space with how the last season ended, but the way you guys are acting is fucking strange to me and makes me feel like you don't understand our situation. So here are some things you should look at to calm you down.

**1) We are in Oklahoma with limited/zero capspace.**
I know it feels like are bigger than we are because the amount of stars we have had, but Oklahoma is one of the smallest and most undesirable markets in the league and the only way we get these really good players is through taking advantages of trades, the draft, or finding underrated players in free agency like Noel. We also have like zero dollars. The fact that I see people getting pissed at presti for not bringing high valued role players to the team from free agency on the minimum is fucking hilarious. Mike Muscala and players like him are what we have space for and keeping in mind that we are in Oklahoma, a place where not a lot of people want to willingly go, we gotta take what we can get. Getting Noel type players on the minimum is not a normal thing, and because we had a down year players have no reason to come here as people dont think we are in contention to win a ring. Seth Curry just got like 32 mill, JJ got 26 mill for 2 years, Bullock got 21 mill. We dont have that.

**2) We already have our superstar players.**
I see everyone posting about Utah getting Mike Conley, or Celtics getting Kemba and getting depressed. Dude we have Paul fucking George signed to a multi year max contract deal. I know he was injured in the playoffs so its easy to forget but I assure you, almost every team that landed a free agent this year would trade him for PG. Dude is a damn near perfect player and is right under Kawhi as a two way player and was better than Kawhi the majority of last season. Top 3 in MVP voting and could of won it if he didn't get injured! Also, we have a top 3 point guard. You can debate placings but I have him right under Lillard as the third best point guard in the entire NBA and the dude couldnt even shoot last year.  Remember how we won a fuck ton of games, and Russ and PG lead nearly every duo statistic in the league last year? Thats coming back this time with Russ shooting a bit better and PG not being injured. The way you guys talk is like we have some shitty players on max contracts like Wiggins or something.

**3) Our big trade will most likely happen mid season.**
To move a lot of these assets that we have, we need to have a lot of these guys come and play to prove they have it. Assuming we trade Steven soon (pls dont Presti), We have to rely on other teams not liking the performance of their squads to move a lot of these guys. No team in this league is unhappy with their starting line up right now, so we have to wait until trade deadline or a couple months before that to find partners who are unhappy. I know we are used to the block buster shit but the trades we need to do most likely wont happen now. People want to see Roberson come back healthy, and Schroder have some good convincing games before we can offload these guys. I personally dont even want to do that but as you guys obsessed with trading the team this is the most likely thing.

**4) None of this shit will matter because we still have Billy**
Our main issue is not a personnel problem. Never really has been. Our issue is our consistency, how we use our talent and how easy we are to scheme for. This is a coaching problem and no amount of stars can fix bad coaching. What do you think is more likely, Steven Adams telling the team he refuses to spread the floor or Billy Donavan purposely limiting Stevens role. By in large what separates a good coach from a bad one is how many dimensions they can see the game in, and how they utilize players from what they see. Steven Adams will be shooting and making 3s/ long 2's if he is on the Celtics because Brad understands how to coach. Billy sees him as one thing and doesn't know how to expand upon that. Same reason why we used fucking Sabonis as a spot up shooter, Same reason we used Oladipo wrong, Same reason why Enes suddenly becomes better, Taj Gibson looks good again, and even Doug McDermott got a little better. There is a reason why every player we get that aren't stars leave and become better. Look at Dwayne Casey and Nick Nurse. Raptors fans hated Ibaka last year because of Dwayne putting him in the wrong position. As soon as Nurse comes in, Ibaka looks like a fucking god. We do this with everyone.  Billy is bad at his job and will hold us back from being great, especially bad at coaching big men. Grant can actually be used way better than we use him now, as he can run the ball down the floor and could do similar shit to Siakam but with us he is used as a 3 and D forward and nothing more. No trades will fix this shit. 

**In short**, we are doing what we can and Presti has done the right things drafting and free agent wise so far.We cant force free agents to sign here and people should stop bitching about shooters as they are on a premium and we aren't the only people looking for them. Billy Donovan is holding us back from our true potential and we will never become better no matter who we get as we still have him coaching. That being said this whole worst team in the west shit has to stop as we are one of the only teams left with solidified chemistry and we will be a 5th/6th seed at worst even with our current roster as we are still pretty fucking good and have the best defense in the league when everyone is not injured and locked in and we have the best shooting forward in the league now that KD is injured and a top 3 guard. We will make the playoffs for sure.","Here is why you are acting delusional about OKC's free agency.

You can debate placings but I have him right under Lillard as the third best point guard in the entire NBA and the dude couldnt even shoot last year.  Remember how we won a fuck ton of games, and Russ and PG lead nearly every duo statistic in the league last year? Thats coming back this time with Russ shooting a bit better and PG not being injured. The way you guys talk is like we have some shitty players on max contracts like Wiggins or something.

**3) Our big trade will most likely happen mid season.**
To move a lot of these assets that we have, we need to have a lot of these guys come and play to prove they have it. Assuming we trade Steven soon (pls dont Presti), We have to rely on other teams not liking the performance of their squads to move a lot of these guys. No team in this league is unhappy with their starting line up right now, so we have to wait until trade deadline or a couple months before that to find partners who are unhappy. I know we are used to the block buster shit but the trades we need to do most likely wont happen now. People want to see Roberson come back healthy, and Schroder have some good convincing games before we can offload these guys. I personally dont even want to do that but as you guys obsessed with trading the team this is the most likely thing.

**4) None of this shit will matter because we still have Billy**
Our main issue is not a personnel problem. Never really has been. Our issue is our consistency, how we use our talent and how easy we are to scheme for. This is a coaching problem and no amount of stars can fix bad coaching. What do you think is more likely, Steven Adams telling the team he refuses to spread the floor or Billy Donavan purposely limiting Stevens role. By in large what separates a good coach from a bad one is how many dimensions they can see the game in, and how they utilize players from what they see. Steven Adams will be shooting and making 3s/ long 2's if he is on the Celtics because Brad understands how to coach. Billy sees him as one thing and doesn't know how to expand upon that. Same reason why we used fucking Sabonis as a spot up shooter, Same reason we used Oladipo wrong, Same reason why Enes suddenly becomes better, Taj Gibson looks good again, and even Doug McDermott got a little better. There is a reason why every player we get that aren't stars leave and become better. Look at Dwayne Casey and Nick Nurse. Raptors fans hated Ibaka last year because of Dwayne putting him in the wrong position. As soon as Nurse comes in, Ibaka looks like a fucking god. We do this with everyone.  Billy is bad at his job and will hold us back from being great, especially bad at coaching big men. Grant can actually be used way better than we use him now, as he can run the ball down the floor and could do similar shit to Siakam but with us he is used as a 3 and D forward and nothing more. No trades will fix this shit. 

**In short**, we are doing what we can and Presti has done the right things drafting and free agent wise so far.We cant force free agents to sign here and people should stop bitching about shooters as they are on a premium and we aren't the only people looking for them. Billy Donovan is holding us back from our true potential and we will never become better no matter who we get as we still have him coaching. That being said this whole worst team in the west shit has to stop as we are one of the only teams left with solidified chemistry and we will be a 5th/6th seed at worst even with our current roster as we are still pretty fucking good and have the best defense in the league when everyone is not injured and locked in and we have the best shooting forward in the league now that KD is injured and a top 3 guard. We will make the playoffs for sure.",36,9,Here is why you are acting delusional about OKC's free agency.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/c7xvs9/here_is_why_you_are_acting_delusional_about_okcs/

Russ, who missed many games at the beginning of the season cause of his knee, had a successful knee surgery a couple of weeks ago and will definitely work on his shooting and HOPEFULLY overthink his decision making when it comes to closing games out in clutch time.

PG played at an MVP level in the first half of the season and was sadly suffering the second half from his shoulder. He also had surgery on his shoulder and will be 100% ready for training camp and I‘m 100% sure he will return to his old self.

Then we have J Grant who was phenomenal throughout the whole season and will make a strong case for MIP next season for sure.

"I see many of you want Fergusson and/or Schroder traded so we can improve our chance for champ.  I agree that we have to make moves,  but I disagree with some potential movements. 

Fergusson is a great rookie. He works hard and has talent! His improvement from 2017-2018 was obvious.  Who knows how good he can be next year? Don't forget pg in his rookie year wasn't a star. 
I absolutely think we should keep Fergusson, Diallo, Burton and our new rookie. We have a great development team and their sell price is lower than it should.  I believe some of them can be very good players even next year.

Schroder is great too! He was great most of the season! He could play alongside Westbrook (not easy),he tried hard on defense (people hate him because he could shut down Lillard lol... no one could,  at least he tried very hard) and there is room for improvement.  He is not a star,  but he is not paid like one and he is a great pick for 6th man, the best we had since Harden. 

For Adams now, I get it. He had a step back this year and that makes him overpaid.  I guess we can search for possible trades,  but if the value for him is low,  maybe we could give him another chance. One bad year doesn't mean he sucks. And I think a big reason for his step back was the system (see below)

Roberson is a tricky player. He is one sided.  Of course he is one of the best on defense. I will never forget how hard he fought against warriors. But one sided players are vulnerability in playoffs. What are the one sided players of Raptors? Of Warriors?  Many people expect him to have improved his shooting. It's not that easy.  I think we should part ways. Of course the selling price is minimal and his contract is 10mil. I doubt there is interest for him

Patrick Patterson. I was so happy when we signed him. Unfortunately it doesn't work. We should move on, but also there is little to no interest 

For Nader, consistency is a big red flag for him. I would say we can part ways. Maybe there is a little interest because he is still very young.

We should DEFINITELY keep Felton. His value for us is great. He can still play as a 3rd pg sometimes, he has improved his shot, but most importantly his mentality is second to none!! We need someone like him to work with rookies and to be a vet voice in locker room.

I believe we should fire BD and change system but unfortunately that has already been decided. At least he should try something different this year 

I know I didn't dive into technical details,  but I think that will come later.

"Westbrook has normally thrived from the 10-16 feet range or his ""cotton shot."" These past two years he's struggled to make these shots. (Although he hasn't been hesitant to take these shots though) In addition, the drop in his cotton shot - which is the same distance as the FT line - has been directly correlated with his drop in FT%.   

&#x200B;

Here's his cotton shot % and FT% over the years. 

&#x200B;

|Year|10-16 Feet FG%|% of FG from than range|FT%|

Russ still took a similar amount of shots from this range, but struggled heavily these past two years. The shot that used to be his bread and butter is now one of his worst shots. He's got to get back to previous levels to improve his and the overall team's offensive efficiency. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also, I don't think his FT woes have had that much to do with the rule change as they've had to do with the decline in his shot overall. As Ben Taylor points out: 

>Since the rule change, Westbrook has shot BETTER on his 2nd or 3rd free throw attempts (on 2 or 3-shot fouls) than on his 1st attempt. In 2018 he was at 72% on his first shot free throws and 76% on 2nd/3rd attempts. At the time of this video in 2019, he was at 57% on his first shot free throws and 73% on 2nd/3rd attempts. This, combined with his overall decline in outside shooting (2s and 3s) leads me to believe that the routine change has essentially no role in Westbrook's decline as a shooter. ","In order for OKC to be successful, Russ NEEDS to bring back his cotton shot.

"I have two issues

1. We are looking to get under the tax (edit: moreso save on our tax bill) but we aren't dumping salary for peanuts. If we were to give up Steven, for example, we'd probably be willing to give him up and receive maybe $20m max back. That's not a salary dump, that's just trying to save some money. Every single team does that.

2. I know you guys love Steve -- I do, too. But he's not just not *that* valuable. He's overpaid, he looks slower, it's tough to see his development and I can get a gang of guys that will rebound and screen for the MLE at worst. 

There are some that are up in arms because they feel like we'd just dump Steve. No. If we can't get Bogi from Sacramento, we just aren't going to trade him. It's really very simple. My guess is Steven rumors are happening because he makes a lot of money and if we got 2 bodies back for the price, guys who can shoot or make plays, then that probably signals the beginning of a new playstyle (which I'm quite interested in).

Nothing we've done indicates this is a salary dumping team. Like we traded Melo for Shroeder for crying out loud. When everyone wrote about how we'd just have to waive and stretch him, we traded, got an asset (who got some 6MOTY votes) and saved $10m. We saved money and got better. That's what a Steven Adams or Andre Roberson trade will be about.

Stop this nonsense that we're being cheap or just plain out mean to Steven. Unless he gets a consisntent 17 foot jump shot, he is literally going to be our ceiling.","Steven Adams trade rumors look like a salary dump because he's just not that valuable I have two issues

In the grand scheme of things it makes sense.  After all, they look at it as a business.  I think some fans think that owners have this mythical sentimental desire to get a random animate object at all costs necessary.

The problem is we are not going to realize the little things Adams does until after he's gone - 2nd chance points,  harsh screens, etc.

One that has gone under the radar is all the bad early losses we had last year(3 vs the Kings and Mavs, 1 vs Bulls, Hawks) I don’t anticipate that will happen again this year. I know it’s been a disappointment with all the first round exits but I truly believe when healthy this team is a title contender and we’ve seen flashes of that.","Hopeful post I’ve heard a lot of negativity from Thunder fans,

&#x200B;

Although he said this, he did say the intention of this draft wasn't to look into the future. He said if Sam thought there was a player that would contribute right away; he would've taken him. Which coincides with Royce Young's report that he was targeting Johnson and Herro.

&#x200B;

Also, Miky Berra brought up an interesting point. He said that selecting an older player expected to contribute, just like any other pick in the 20s, doesn't pan out the majority of the time. If an older player doesn't pan out, they have no value and are often soon out of the league. A young player retains value even if they don't pan out because many teams feel that they can still develop these players due to their young age. Think about it, Cam Payne is arguably the worst player in the NBA but Presti still got Gibson + McDermott + a high 2nd for him.","[Dawson] The take I got from a lot of people is that this pick was a swing for the future.

So I am not trolling when I ask this: is it time for Sam to trade him? 

There are teams that need a point guard (and a star) and you guys need to get out of the first round. I’m not being a dick but is there any faction of the fan base that wants to get as much value as you can and bid Russ a loving farewell?","Question from an outsider Hello!

"The tweet from Scissorhands saying Adams is heading to the Celtics has a lot of people talking about a sign-and-trade for Al Horford. So I thought I’d go over the details of what has to happen for that to be possible.

If you acquire a player through a sign-and-trade, your team is automatically hard capped at the tax apron. Next year, that will be approximately $138 million. That means, for all of next season, OKC would not be able to go over that number for any reason. The Thunder’s committed money for next season is currently around $149 million (that includes Bazley) for 12 players (league minimum is 14 players), so a sign-and-trade can’t be legally executed with the team’s current construction. 

Marc Stein is reporting that teams believe the offer on the table for Horford is 4 years, $112 million. They can structure that contract to make it possible to swap Adams for Horford straight up at $26 million next season. So that money would cancel out and leave OKC at $149 million for 12 players. They’d have to cut at least $11 million while also adding two more players. 

So first things first, they’d have to trade away both Schroder and Roberson while getting back basically no money in return. This is the big stumbling block to this scenario, because there simply aren’t many teams out there that would take either player at their current price. Roberson has value as an expiring contract, but that only helps a team trying to get out from under a contract they don’t want. To get teams to take these contracts, OKC likely would have to include a sweetener. That could be a pick (they can’t trade one until 2024), or it could be guys like Bazley or Diallo. This is the step that makes me personally think they can’t pull this off. I can’t imagine being able to swing deals dumping both those players for nothing.

But let’s say for a minute that Presti somehow convinces teams to take Schroder and Roberson into cap space while getting no money in return. That would clear $26 million, bringing OKC down to $123 million for 10 players. They’d need to sign four more players and would only have $15 million to work with (and to maintain flexibility, they wouldn’t want to use up all $15 million). So basically, they could sign four guys to vet minimum deals (~$2.5 million each, for a total of $10 million).

TL;DR. Here are the steps necessary in pulling off a Horford S&T and still having a full roster:
- Agree to a contract with Horford
- Send Adams to Boston in a straight-up trade
- Find teams with cap space willing to acquire Schroder and Roberson without sending any money back
- Sign four players to vet minimum deals

It’s mathematically possible, but extremely difficult to pull off. We’ll see if Presti can work his magic again. I think it’s more likely that Scissorhands is mistaken or the Thunder are trying to get Marcus Smart (good luck with that), but we’ll soon find out.","The maneuvering necessary to get Al Horford in a sign-and-trade The tweet from Scissorhands saying Adams is heading to the Celtics has a lot of people talking about a sign-and-trade for Al Horford.

"The Thunder seriously need to revitalize the bench this offseason and as a capped out team but Terrence Ross, JJ Redick and Danny Green are just fever dreams.

There aren't many options with only the minimum and a $5.7 million mid-level exception.

So who are some options for OKC this offseason.

Candidates for MLE
1. Rudy Gay (~$5 million)
Likely will cost most if not all of the mid-level exception, Rudy Gay had an good season for the Spurs, averaging 13.7 PPG and 6.8 RPG. He's on the older side at 32, turning 33 in August but he's a solid veteran, a good shooter with a strong build that would fit OKC's defense.

2. Seth Curry (~$5 million)
Seth Curry is likely to go for much more but if he were to take a paycut to play for the Thunder, he'd fit right in as a spot-up shooter for the Thunder. He only averaged 7.9 PPG last season but shot a blistering 45% from three and if you didn't know and it hasn't been drilled into your head yet, OKC NEEDS SHOOTERS.

3. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (~$5 million)
KCP's stock is definitely low, he only averaged 11.4 PPG last season and played the least minutes since his rookie year. It's a gamble but KCP definitely showed flashes of being a solid player back when he was at Detroit.

4. Dewayne Dedmon (~$5 million)
Dedmon is probably too expensive so this is a shot in the dark but he'd be a great fit as a modern day center. He shot 38% on 3PT on about 3.4 shots. He also average a career high 10.8 PPG last year as a member of the Hawks. The unlikeliest of the candidates but he could be OKC's X-factor similar to Brook Lopez on Milwaukee.

Candidates for the Minimum
1. Garrett Temple
Temple has jumped around the league a lot but he's a career 41% shooter and he'd be one of the few long-range bombers on the cheap.

2. CJ Miles
Continuing the trend of cheap shooters, CJ Miles didn't play much last year after getting traded to Memphis but he's a career 36% 3PT shooter on 4 attempts.

3. David Nwaba
We remember Nwaba mainly for his solid Chicago stint a year ago but he can still be an effective defensive player with offensive flashes in the right situation. Is OKC that situation, we don't know.

4. Jonas Jerebko
He really only played garbage minutes foe the Warriors last season and he wasn't particularly effective either in those minutes but he's averaged 40% on 3PT in three season before and his market remains solid as a stretch big.

5. Reggie Bullock
Not much else to say again except he's a 39% 3PT shooter for his career. He'd fit right in either starting at the 2 or as an off the bench bomber.

Any other cheap players I missed? Are the Thunder doomed to never be able to shoot 3PT? I'd love to hear your comments below!","Who are some cheap bench options for OKC this offseason? The Thunder seriously need to revitalize the bench this offseason and as a capped out team but Terrence Ross, JJ Redick and Danny Green are just fever dreams.

There aren't many options with only the minimum and a $5.7 million mid-level exception.

So who are some options for OKC this offseason.

Candidates for MLE
1. Rudy Gay (~$5 million)
Likely will cost most if not all of the mid-level exception, Rudy Gay had an good season for the Spurs, averaging 13.7 PPG and 6.8 RPG. He's on the older side at 32, turning 33 in August but he's a solid veteran, a good shooter with a strong build that would fit OKC's defense.

2. Seth Curry (~$5 million)
Seth Curry is likely to go for much more but if he were to take a paycut to play for the Thunder, he'd fit right in as a spot-up shooter for the Thunder. He only averaged 7.9 PPG last season but shot a blistering 45% from three and if you didn't know and it hasn't been drilled into your head yet, OKC NEEDS SHOOTERS.

3. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (~$5 million)
KCP's stock is definitely low, he only averaged 11.4 PPG last season and played the least minutes since his rookie year. It's a gamble but KCP definitely showed flashes of being a solid player back when he was at Detroit.

4. Dewayne Dedmon (~$5 million)
Dedmon is probably too expensive so this is a shot in the dark but he'd be a great fit as a modern day center. He shot 38% on 3PT on about 3.4 shots. He also average a career high 10.8 PPG last year as a member of the Hawks. The unlikeliest of the candidates but he could be OKC's X-factor similar to Brook Lopez on Milwaukee.

Candidates for the Minimum
1. Garrett Temple
Temple has jumped around the league a lot but he's a career 41% shooter and he'd be one of the few long-range bombers on the cheap.

2. CJ Miles
Continuing the trend of cheap shooters, CJ Miles didn't play much last year after getting traded to Memphis but he's a career 36% 3PT shooter on 4 attempts.

3. David Nwaba
We remember Nwaba mainly for his solid Chicago stint a year ago but he can still be an effective defensive player with offensive flashes in the right situation. Is OKC that situation, we don't know.

4. Jonas Jerebko

"King, a lengthy 6’9” SF out of Oregon, carried a large portion of the offensive load for the Ducks post-Bol injury. He scored more than 13 points per game, handled the ball with fluidity in the open court, and shot the three at nearly 39%. King was particularly devastating in spot-up possessions, as his catch-and-shoot three proved incredibly effective, especially throughout March while Oregon made their sweet 16 run. Prior to the draft, King was a consensus 30-40th range draft pick, and he ranked #11 overall in ESPN’s 2018 Top 100. The potential of a great shooter with NBA size is there for sure.

"Going into the draft the Thunder are in a terrible position. We are losing Noel and Morris and we are in cap troubles. Here’s what i would do if I was Presti:

Trade:

Suns Receive: Dennis Schroeder 

Thunder Receive: TJ Warren 

TJ Warren is basically wheat Beal would’ve given us, perfect 3rd option, 30 minutes off the bench and PG at SG when he’s on, he shoots 43% from 3, and I see him as a guy who will score a quiet 15 a game and go for 25+ when he’s feeling it.

Pick 21: 

We pick if 

Bol Bol C (Dudes such a mystery he’s worth risking on, he’s 17 on my mock)


Kevin Porter Jr.  SG/SF top 10 scorer in this class (18 on my mock)


PJ Washington perfect PF, big body who has grown on me since watching his highlights. He can play for us day 1, and in a few years he’s a starting caliber player (19 on my mock)

Are on the board



Trade Pick:


76ers Receive: Pick 21

Thunder Receive: Pick 33, Pick 34


Pick 33:

Jontay Porter PF/C

top 15 player on my big board, if he remains healthy I see him being a stretch big for us, who possesses an all around game already. He was a lottery guy going into this year, until he retire his ACL playing pick up.


Pick 34:


Darius Bazley SF

He’s a 6’9 Ball Handler, potential is high for him, he skipped college, backed out of the g league and worked with a shoe company, he’s a very mysterious prospect who I think could be another Mitchell Robinson, good player in the long term.

Or


Jalen Lecque


6’4 PG with crazy athleticism needs to work on shooting, he’s coming out of high school and needs to develop, but I think he will be a solid backup on a few years.



If Kevin Porter Jr. is at 21;

We should take KPJ and trade into a top 40 pick, the Warriors traded into 41, I have nothing to back me up, but I am certain Jontay is the pick if he’s at 41, if we trade up and draft Jontay, we not only have an offensive juggernaut but now he have a Stretch Big in Jontay.



The possibility of KPJ falling is low as is, but if we take him AND trade in to take Jontay I’d faint. 



Obviously with Donovan at coach we’re not making it out of the first round, but these three additions make us better in both the long term and short term.","What I Would Do If I Was Presti Going into the draft the Thunder are in a terrible position.

"Here me out.

I think most people here agree that after 3 first round exits in a row and the clear holes we have in our offense some changes to the roster need to be made. But maybe the smartest move could be to wait things out a little longer and hopefully a better fit becomes available down the line?

There is no one that pushes the needle forward that a team is selling low on currently. Unless Presti pulls a miracle there is not much we can offer that will be worth making a move on.

Adams value after a disappointing playoffs performance is probably at it's lowest since signing his extension. It has seemingly been a trend the past few seasons where Adam's starts each season really well and progressively gets worse as the season goes on. His style of play most likely wears on his body more than most players. I do not see us getting a fair return for Adams at this stage. He is our 3rd most important player and was in the All Star discussion before all star break. 

Roberson's contract will gain more value as the dust settles after free agency and rosters take shape. He will be an expiring deal and teams may be willing to give up an asset if they want to clear space to make a splash next free agency or make room to re-sign key players.

Guys like Ferguson, Grant and even Diallo are still able to make leaps as players and increase their value. These guys can become bigger trade chips if they make statistical improvements next season. 

I'm not a fan of Schroder and hopefully Presti can move him without needing to give up an asset. Someone like the Suns may be desperate for a starting point guard if they strike out in free agency.

We bank on development of Ferguson, Grant possibly even Hami and build their value up. We hopefully sign a decent vet on a MLE. And we wait for a team looking to sell low on someone during next season. I won't be disappointed personally if we don't make any big moves this off-season.","Is the best move to make no move this off-season? Here me out.

"There is a lot of disagreement in this sub about the reason for our recent playoff failures (Injuries, Russ, Shooting, Billy, Adams, Presti) but the fact remains that we have a total of 4 playoff wins in the last 3 years with 0 road playoff wins. 
The ownership won't keep paying luxury tax for quick postseason exits. There is already reports about trading the 21 pick for tax relief but i think Presti wants to get a rotation player or save money to spend in free agency with the trade.
I don't see us running it back next year if we don't make a deep playoff run this year. We will have a fire sale and ownership will surely want something back for PG instead of letting him go for free as he will be our best trade asset.
While rebuilding is the logical thing to do in that situation, it will suck to have a bad team for a number of years given the quality of players we have had in the last 10 years. I guess we have been spoiled as Thunder fans.

"I was bored. Lol. This is MY OWN big board going into the offseason. Not saying that all of these are believable and you should all agree into but this is pretty much what's going on in our sub the past few weeks.

OFFSEASON NEEDS:
Coaching
Shooting
Backup Big
3rd star(?)


PART 1: COACHING.

Well I don't know what's going on inside our organization. There are no news whatsoever about replacements for the 3 assistant coaches we've lost recently so I am thinking that Presti will wait and see what would happen at the free agency before deciding who to hire as assistant coaches.


PART 2: DRAFT

Not much to say bout this either cause we are projected to trade it away to improve our Roster to WIN-NOW. But if we ever make our draft pick this would be MY ideal selections.

Tier 1

Bitadze, NAW, Clarke, Little, Hachimura

Tier 2

Thybulle, Samanic, Porter Jr., Bol, Langford

Tier 3

Herro, Johnson, Windler, Edwards

*reasons for Herro/Johnson at Tier 3... I just think that we could get our shooter in Free Agency not in the draft. I might be wrong though. Either way I am expecting this pick to be traded.

Also, I believe that we will buy/trade for a 2nd rd draft pick and draft one of Lecque/Horton-Tucker/Gafford/Roby


PART 3: FREE AGENCY

ASSETS:
Tier 1: Grant, Ferguson, 21st pick, Melo's 10.9 trade exception

Tier 2: Adams, Schroder, Diallo

Tier 3: Patterson, Nader
*Didn't include Roberson cause let's face it even if he's an expiring contract, OKC would rather test him out and if he is not the same Roberson pre-injury then ship him at the Trade Deadline. He'll be more valuable then.

IDEAL TRADE TARGETS: (not saying they are believable or it will happen)

Tier 1:
Holiday
Beal
Griffin

Tier 2:
Love
Derozan
Horford
Miles Turner(even if its a long shot. We need this kind of center. A 3 and D center who can somehow matchup with AD)

Tier 3:
TJ Warren
Bogdan Bogdanovic(SAC has capspace, needs a Center)
Gary Harris(most likely off the table but an ideal 2 for us)

Non-guaranteed contracts/Partially Guaranteed (trades for trimming up salaries)
Paul Millsap($30m team option)
Jabari Parker($20m)
George Hill($18m)
Derrick Favors($16m)
JR Smith($3.87m guaranteed of his $15.68m)
Avery Bradley($2m guaranteed of his $12m)

GOALS ON WHY WE TRADE:
Get a 3rd star
Get below the tax or lessen tax
Get the non-taxpayer's MLE if possible
Get shooting as much as possible

Possible targets for Melo's $10.8m Trade Exception(we'll take advantage of teams wanting cap relief. Lol. Ironic. I know. But these are the teams that are looking for cap spaces to sign max contracts)
MIA - Richardson
BRK - Dinwiddie, Harris
NYK - Ntilikina, Trier
LAC - Lou Will

Free agent targets

Center
- Brook Lopez and Robin Lopez(if Adams is traded for an SG, offer both the Lopez Brothers the C spot and maybe playing together would entice them to sign hopefully with our non-tax MLE)
- Dewayne Dedmon
- Nerlens Noel
- Javale McGee
- Cauley-Stein

Backup PG
Darren Collison
Mudiay
Pat Bev
George Hill
Jerian Grant
Delon Wright

Backup wing
KCP
Reggie Bullock
Rodney Hood
Wayne Ellington
Wesley Matthews
Justin Holiday

Backup big for minimum
Vonleh
Tolliver
Jerebko
Jeff Green


Notes:

- We need a good defensive big man replacement if Adams is traded. Especially for big men like Davis, Jokic, KAT, Embiid. Surprisingly, Brook Lopez is a top 5 player in blocks last season(2.2 per game) so maybe he'll do. Grant is too small and would rather have him as a weak-side help.

- Non-guaranteed salaries is a big help decreasing our salaries.

-TJ Warren is very injury prone. Most games he played in a season is 66 games.

As fans, it is very difficult to admit that the players need to step up. Because we love them, they're the face of the sport that we love, our city. So we blame anyone else we can first.   


Let me preface this by saying; Billy Donovan and Sam Presti are not free from blame. They have a role to play in why we have 3 first round exists in a row. Moreso on Billy, as Sam has to answer to owners whims.  


But the main point is the fact that any trade that we make, any sort of signing or pickup will not fundamentally change how our guys perform. In order to TRULY improve next year, our guys need to step up and put more effort into their game this offseason. We were #8 in open shots this last year, with Paul George being #1. Not in efficiency, but in amount taken. That is the key.  
Billy Donovan is not to blame in this aspect. His scheme gets the team open shots, but he can't make them for them. This is our biggest problem. Not lineups, not timeouts, not demanding players do what you say, etc. Those are all problems that Billy has, but they are not as big as MAKING SHOTS.  


We need some definite improvement from Russ, Ferg, Dre (If he comes back), Steven, Diallo, PPat, Burton, and even PG and Jerami need to step up their shooting, as good as it is. We need all of them to improve a little, but AT LEAST one of them to improve a la Jerami Grant in order to make a deep run.  


Now that brings us to Russ. I'm not for speculation, but I truly believe that he has taken a lot more time off during the past 2 summers due to having children. You can argue whether or not this is warranted or not, but I'm not going to say anything on it. But if we truly want to see some improvement, it starts right here at Russ. The reason he made himself in the league is because he was ONLY worried about basketball. His athletic gift allowed him to work harder than any other player in this league, and his tenacity is why he has so many accolades. Without it, his talent alone would probably have him as a simple role player, if that.   


The success of this team is almost solely on Russ' ability to improve and focus this summer. If he can make a jump, take some more shots in the gym, and space the floor, this team will be very scary. If not, however, we will have to rely on a multitude of other guys to make improvements this year, and with each one of them it is a flip of a coin if they will improve or not.

"Yes I know these “coming in peace” posts are annoying but hear me out.


I’m going to preface this by saying I completely respect the Thunder organization, respect Sam Presti as a GM, and usually root for the Thunder in the playoffs (We dont really get there that much)


The Washington Wizards subreddit and myself both agree that we would not trade Beal unless we get an absolute HAUL, and our owner has repeatedly said he wants to keep Beal and build around him. Keep in mind also, we don’t even have a GM right now. Tommy Sheppard has been the interim but hasn’t made any moves and I don’t expect him to until he is named official GM or we hire a new one. 


None of the pieces I see you guys offering are worth Beal that much. Obviously you guys would never include Westbrook or George in a deal. You shouldn’t. But none of the packages  I see consistently offered when some of you guys come on the Wizards sub are viable. They mainly Include some combo of Adams, Grant, Ferguson, Schroeder, picks. Adams is a great player, of course. However, he’s not really the piece we need. He’s a center in his prime right now and if we trade beal, we aren’t a contending team. We don’t need Adams. Obviously he’s better than anyone we have at center and he’s a good player, but he’s not one we need. Schroeder fits that kind of thing too. He’s in his prime and to me, he’s a good sixth man for a contender. We don’t need him trading Beal or not. We won’t be able to offload the Wall contract, and if we were dead set on trading Beal, there are many other pieces from other teams that could be offered that better fit the direction of the team. I’ll admit that I don’t know that much about Grant or Ferguson, but that says something in itself. What I’ve read suggests (for Ferguson) is that he’s a young guy with potential. He’s a player that we would actually trade for. A young wing with potential is GREAT. However, he’s a supporting piece in a trade of Beals caliber. Nothing more. Feel free to tell me what Grant bring to the table in the comments, I’d like to know. As for the picks, most of those will be 20 and after selections that don’t hold much value. You guys are contenders and especially with Beal you would make a title push. 


Obviously we all look at deals from the perspective of what’s in our teams best interest. I’d love to have a conversation in the comments from some of you guys’ point of view. The main reason I came over here was just to say that many of these deals for beals are unrealistic. I can for sure see why you want him, but I highly doubt it’s happening so don’t place bets on it. The Wizards subreddit and I don’t think a deal will work out between us with the pieces you are offering, and it looks like you guys really want him.

Thunder send Roberson + 21st pick to Bulls for Kris Dunn and Denzel Valentine.

Thunder send Schroder to PHX for TJ Warren

"I'm looking at both those teams and wondering how we can ever be that. I think we can be elite defensively. Offensively, I'm looking at both teams and thinking we need WAY more playmakers.

I mean Toronto legit has 4-5 play makers on the floor at a time with Kawhi, Kyle, Pascal, Marc, Van Vleet -- guys who can see and make any pass, guys who can create for themselves and others. Same(ish) for Warriors, who while hurt have may 2-3, but typically have 3-4 with Steph, Dray, KD, Cousins, Iggy, Shawn.

You know, I think our shooting is overblown, I've said that before. I think the worst thing is teams are being more aggressive on three point shooters so those guys kinda have to evolve. Run off screens sure, but when the defender closes the gap quickly, what are you going to do? Toronto even had to sit Danny Green a few times because they needed someone to make a play, not just shoot. 

We've got Russ, Paul, Dennis and then we fall off a cliff. I continue to get really upset at Steve's lack of progress in the last two years. I thought he was a REALLY good passing big in 2016 and had lots of potential. That just seems to have disappeared. Ferg has shown flashes but in terms of playmaking, we don't have much. It's no wonder we end up in iso situations so much. Can't move the ball when other guys don't legit know how/where to move the ball.

Again, I think what both teams do defensively, we could match. A lot of it is team defense and effort. Both teams have 2 or so lock down defenders out there at a time. EVeryone else is just trying really hard...I think with Dre coming back, I'm with that and I feel great.

But offensively, Idk. Everyone wants shooting and I just don't think that's it. We need a smart front court that can make plays a la Dray/Pascal and Cousins (shit Bogut even had 3ast)/Marc....gosh Marc has been so good. I'm most happy for Marc...I will legit cry for him.

All in all, you look at the top teams this year and they all had multiple playmakers. Anyone can (and does) shoot the three and I 100% believe Russ comes back better...he shoots it at 32% rather than 29%, and we're a much better team. 

We get Ferg shooting 37% all season long, we're better (he started out in the 20s then had some 40% months). Get Nader comfy in his role (I happen to think he was a lot better after we gave him some time and I'm optimistic for his growth this summer) and get him shooting 34-35% on 3-4 shots a game, we're good. We'll have some hot games but overall if we shot 35-36% as a team (we shot 34.8%), that's fine. 

But God, do we need some people who can create.","For those watching the Finals, what's your optimism level for us right now? I'm looking at both those teams and wondering how we can ever be that.

"I know this topic has been overdone to death, but I don’t even understand why Billy is still the coach.

"We have 5.6 million dollars to spend in the form of mini/tax-payers MLE this summer. We can sign as many players that can fit on the roster to minimum contracts as well. Currently, we have **3** open roster spots including our first round pick. If Presti brings back Felton, we'll have **2** unless he declines Nader's team option.

&#x200B;

Here are some realistic targets:

&#x200B;

**Reggie Bullock (SG)**

*40% + from 3, solid defender. He would be a great fit to this team and could potentially even start depending on how T-Ferg plays. The only issue is that he'll be pursed by almost every other contender given his skill set and he may cost more than we can give out.*

Projected Cost: Full mini-MLE

Competition for him: Very high

&#x200B;

**Troy Daniels (SG)**

*Very good shooter, below average defender. He struggled to get minutes for the Suns this year, but he's an amazing shooter and would be a good player to take a flier on. In addition, he's played big playoff minutes before with the Rockets and even hit a game winner. He'd be great as a utility guy and would be a big upgrade over Nader/Felton.*

Cost: Minimum

Competition: Low

&#x200B;

**Anthony Tolliver (PF)**

*Career 38% from 3. Solid defender. Would get much more consistent minutes here than in Minnesota. Presti targeted him at the deadline.*

Cost: Full mini-MLE

Competition: Moderate

&#x200B;

**JaMychal Green (PF)**

*Shot 40% from 3 last year. Solid defender. The Clippers are looking to sign a big free agent and probably can't re-sign him* if *they want to retain cap space.*

Cost: Full mini-MLE

Competition: Moderately high

&#x200B;

**Dante Cunningham (PF)**

*Average shooter, above average defender. Struggled to get consistent minutes in San Antonio. Might be a good idea to take a flier on him.*

Cost: Minimum or part of mini-MLE

Competition: Low

&#x200B;

**Glenn Robinson (SF)**

*Streaky shooter, okay defender. Struggled to get minutes in Detroit. He shot 41% and 39% from 3 his two prior years, but shot 29% last year in Detroit. Might be a good idea to take a flier on him and use him as a utility guy off the bench like Nader/Felton.*

Cost: Minimum

Competition: Low

&#x200B;

**Taj Gibson (C)**

*Was great when he was here. He would be a great backup center. He's a great rebounder, switchable defender, solid shooter (mainly midrange), and great locker room guy.*

Cost: Full mini-MLE

Competition: Moderate

&#x200B;

**Kousta Koufos (C)**

*Solid backup center. Can give you 10-15 minutes a night.*

Cost: Minimum

Competition: Low

&#x200B;

**Justin Holiday (SG)**

*Solid but streaky shooter. Solid defender. Shot 36% from 3 for 2 years in Chicago, but only 33% in Memphis. Seems to be T-Ferg level shooter and player but he's 30. Doesn't fit Memphis' timeline.*

Cost: Part of mini-MLE

Competition: Low to Moderate

&#x200B;

**Garrett Temple (SG)**

*Good defender. Shoots well in places he fits well. Not a player who will shoot well on every team. Shot 39% and 37% from 3 in Sacramento, but shot 29% and 35% on the Clippers and Grizzlies respectively.*

Cost: Part of mini-MLE

Competition: Moderate

&#x200B;

**Wesley Matthews (SG)**

*Good defender. Above-average, but streaky shooter. Shot 37% from 3 in Indiana and 38% in Dallas. PG and Russ have recruited him before and may recruit him again this summer.*

Cost: Part of mini-MLE

Competition: Moderate

&#x200B;

**Noah Vonleh (PF)**

*Below average shooter. Shot 33% in NY on low volume. Tough to evaluate his defense on a tanking team. Might be a good idea to take a flier on him.*

Cost: Minimum

Competition: Low to Moderate

&#x200B;

**Darius Miller (PF)**

*Good shooter, average defender. Shoot 37% and 41% in NO on relatively high volume from 3. Not a good rebounder, but would be a great addition to this team given his shooting prowess.*

Cost: Part of to full mini-MLE

Competition: Moderate

&#x200B;

**Wilson Chandler (SF/PF)**

*Solid shooter, above-average defender. Shot 39% in PHI, but 33% in LAC. Shot 36% last year in Denver. Could potentially get him for cheap. He'd be a great fit to this team.*

Cost: Minimum or part of mini-MLE

Competition: Moderate

&#x200B;

**Alec Burks (SG)**

*Good scorer and solid, but streaky shooter. Average defender. Played awful in SAC, however. Somehow managed to not make one 3 in 15 games there.*

Cost: Part of mini-MLE to full mini-MLE

Competition: Moderate

&#x200B;

**Luc Mbah a Moute (SF/PF)**

*Dealt with injuries last year and will most certainly drop his cost in FA. Solid, but not respected shooter. Sort of like Sefolasha when he was here. Elite defender, however. Would be a good idea to take a flier on him as he can be a great contributer to a contender.*

Cost: Minimum

Competition: Moderate

&#x200B;

**Nerlens Noel (C)**

*Was a solid backup center last season. He might come back, but I think it's based on money with him. If he gets offered similar roles on the same contract we can offer, I see him staying here. However, if he gets offered a starting role or more money, I definitely see him leaving.*

Cost: Full mini-MLE

Competition: Moderately high

&#x200B;

**Wayne Ellington (SG)**

*Good shooter, but best running off-screens. Below average defender. He can potentially lose his starting role depending on who they sign this summer.*

Cost: Full mini-MLE

Competition: High

&#x200B;

**Furkan Kormaz (SG)**

*He's a solid shooter who doesn't get a lot of minutes of the 76ers. Although he struggled shooting from 3 there, it could be contributed to inconsistent minutes. Might be worth a flier.*

Cost: Minimum

Competition: Low

&#x200B;

**Javale McGee (C)**

*Could be solid backup center for us. Although he's a meme, he's actually a pretty good player. The Lakers want to conserve cap-space to sign a big FA.*

Cost: Minimum or part of MLE

Competition: Moderately high

&#x200B;

**Kyle O'Quinn (C)**

*Could be solid as backup to Adams. He struggled to get minutes in Indiana due to their loaded front court. Might get less money due to this and could be a steal.*

Cost: Minimum or part of MLE

Competition: Moderate

&#x200B;

**Unrealistic Targets**:

&#x200B;

**Brook Lopez**

*He'll either take a 10-15 million per year salary or take a pay cut on the Bucks. Milwakee is an ideal place for him. So there's almost no chance takes the a paycut to come here.*

&#x200B;

**Danny Green**

*He'll be paid around 10-15 million per year as well. There's no chance he gets paid only 5.6 million when he's the ideal 3 and D player.*

&#x200B;

**Seth Curry**

*He seems to love Portland and they can offer the same amount as us. I don't seem him leaving.*

&#x200B;

**Rodney Hood**

*The Blazers have his bird rights and I see him getting more than the mini-MLE of 5.6 million.*

&#x200B;

**DeWayne Dedmon**

*He seems to like Atlanta and is already getting paid more than 5.6 million. I can seem them offering a similar contract. I don't seem him taking a pay-cut to be a backup here when he can get more minutes in Atlanta. Also teams who need starting centers can use their cap space to pay for him.*

&#x200B;

**Patrick Beverly**

*He'll definitely be paid more than the mini-MLE. Considering the beef with Russ, there's basically zero chance he comes here.*

&#x200B;

**Terrance Ross**

*Almost certain to get paid more than mini-MLE.*

&#x200B;

**Jeremy Lamb**

*Most likely get paid more than the mini-MLE. Probably doesn't want to come back here either.*

&#x200B;

**Rudy Gay**

*He'll most likely get paid more than the mini-MLE or take less to ring chase.*

&#x200B;

"I'm from Toronto so my home team is Raptors but my favorite player by far is Russell fucking Westbrook!!!. Now the Raptors are a good example of a why a coaching change is needed. Even though Dwane Casey did coach them to a 1 win better record last year he just couldn't perform in the playoffs. We all know playoffs are a whole different game. For anyone who followed the ECF, our new coach Nick Nurse who was also down 2 in the series went on to win 4 in a row. Most of it was due to adjustments being made, also DOUBLE TEAMING Giannis in most cases and have players rotating over to open shooters when needed. Now Billy Donovan couldn't even muster the IQ to do this with Dame Lillard. Also the style of basketball Billy plays is also the style of basketball that Dwane Casey use to play as well AKA whole lot of ISO ball. Nick Nurse was actually the one who implemented the new system (Lots of ball movement) which made Raptors have the #1 record last year. They were only 1 win short this year. Just having a hard time understanding why Sam Presti is being such an incompetent GM right now after THREE FIRST ROUND EXITS. He needs to get some balls and make the right moves. On paper we always had the better roster for the past two years on Utah & Portland. Masai Ujiri was even widely criticized for the moves he made last year but look where they are at now.

"After reading one too many dumbass comments about Westbrook's triple-doubles I decided to look at how much of a difference that one extra assist or rebound makes on OKC's performance. Using pts/trb/ast here's OKC's win% when Russ barely misses the triple-double vs when he barely gets it:

**X/10+/9 or X/9/10+: 18-20 record .474 win%**

**X/10+/10 or X/10/10+: 41-6 record .872 win%**

When he has 10+ rebounds and 9 assists, OKC is 5-10. When he has 10+ assists and 9 rebounds, OKC is 13-10. This makes them an uninspiring 18-20 when he has only 9 of the one stat with at least 10 of the other. On the other hand, when he has exactly 10 of one stat and at least 10 of the other OKC is 41-6 (and I did remove the duplicates for when he has exactly 10 of both).

There are tons of possible reasons why the difference is so massive. Maybe Westbrook's teammates aren't missing as much so he's able to get that extra assist, or the opponents are having bad shooting nights/OKC's defense is better resulting in more rebound opportunities...there are a lot of factors at play. But what we do know is that in those games where Russ barely manages the triple-double, OKC wins a hell of a lot more than when he narrowly misses.

It's hard for me to believe the majority opinion has shifted after three years, unless someone analyzes it and proves to me those are all KD' burner account or hired bots, that's an ugly situation we're in. 

Guys, grow up and have some self respect, it's not the rings or final runs that makes an organization great, it's the people and the values they stand for (look at SAS).

If he has some self respect he finds another wife, even if she's far less sexy who respects him rather than beg after his ex. He will try and work and get the $$, which are only tools rather than indications of his value.

"I want to draft a shooter, too. I really do. I do not, however, want to trade a defensive piece for someone who's only purpose is to shoot. That's dumb.

Anecdotally, we know if we have solid defense, we can typically play with one person on the floor that's not that great defensively. When we are locked in, we're a team that can successfully hide people who try. Look at Carmelo Anthony, Anthony Marrow, Alex Abrines, Dennis, etc. When we have the right guys on the court, we can hide a shooter who tries defensively.

So sure. All on board for a shooter.

The issue is you guys think that's the solve and it isn't.

This year, as a team, we took a total of 2677 threes. That's good for 13th in the league. Shooting more threes =/= winning. The top 5 teams in total 3s attempted are Rockets, Hawks, Bucks, Mavs, Nets. Total 3PA does not seem to correlate at all to any type of success in the season or post season. GSW sits at #8 with 2824 total 3PA, less than 200 more than us. 

I think most of the top 15 teams make it a point to shoot a good
 amount of threes for sure. But again. It's not an indicator.

Now let's look at the break down of 3PA per players on our team:

|Rk||G|3P|3PA|3P%|

Generated 5/21/2019.

Here's my problem. Russ took 411 threes. Dennis took 364. While Jerami took 293 and Ferg took 290.

Do you see the problem here? Two of our players with the second best 3P% on our team took way less shots than two guys who frankly aren't looked at as 3 point shooters.

Dennis shooting 34% is great. It'd be even better if he didn't take 4.6 a game. Russ, at 29%, took 5.6 a game. That's bad shot distribution and selection.

---

Now let's do some math. 

If you asked Russ to take closer to 3 a game you could redistribute those to Jerami and Ferg...so let's split that 1.6 equally between the two of them...0.8. Take another 1.6 from Dennis and redistribute to PG/Ferg/Jerm (cuz he's on the floor a lot) that's about .5 per person...so give Ferg and JErm an addition 1.3 shots and PG an additional .5.

That brings the totals per game:

Jerami goes from 3.7 to 5.0

Ferg goes from 3.9 to 5.2

PG goes from 9.8 to 10.3 (which is kind of a lot but not a huge difference from where he's at now).

That also puts

Russ from 5.6 to 3 a game and Dennis from 4.6 to also 3 a game.

That would bring the totals for our top 5 closer to something like this:

Jerami = 80 games played x 5 shots a game = 400 shots (from 293)

Ferg = 74 games played x 5.2 shots a game = 384.8 or 349 shots (from 290)

PG = 77 game played x 10.3 shots a game = 793.1 or 793 (from 757)

Russ = 73 games played x 3 shots = 219 shots (from 411)

Dennis = 79 games played x 3 shots = 237 shots

---

I understand this is assuming a lot of the stuff stays the same. Does Ferg shoot the same percentage with more shots? Does anyone? Does Russ shoot better on less shots?

I get it. But the point is, you want your better 3pt shooters taking the shots. New shot distribution for top 5 looks like this: 

|Rk||G|3P|3PA|3P%|
|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|1|Paul George|77|306|793|.386|
|2|Russell Westbrook|73|64|219|.290|
|3|Dennis Schroder|79|81|237|.341|
|4|Jerami Grant|80|157|400|.392|
|5|Terrance Ferguson|74|128|349|.366|

Just this minor shot distribution makes as a 35.6% 3 point shooting team. That's the exact same percentage as the Houston Rockets.

---

so yea...this is wishful thinking and again, it's not 'good' math....just predictive math. if russ and dennis took less threes, and redistributed, we could increase our percentages. but also what if more people stuck a foot in the paint cuz our PGs won't shoot and all that other stuff?

---

Russ and Dennis should shoot better threes.

There aren't a ton of places Russ was really good from three this season. He liked that left wing a lot, shot 48 times and made 35%. He also took 55 from the top of the key  and made 13%. If he were to just scoot over to his left a bit, some of those may have done in.

Even from the corners, he wasn't particularly good this season. Even last season, he didn't take a lot of corner shots. He shot 50% but he took like 4 shots lol. Even looking through the seasons, it feels a lot like Russ doesn't have a particular spot...

In his MVP season, he still really liked the top of the arc -- there he shot 257 shots and made 35%. Not bad. He was still better on the left wing, but only shot 130 shots even though he made 37%.

My guess is Russ really likes to take those pull threes from straight up top. He's kinda tamed that but...if he just went to the left wing a bit more and got comfortable there, less shots from top, he'd be a lot better.

And while he dislikes the corners, he's better from the left corner. He only gave us 27% from there this season, but 44% the previous. So again, perhaps that's a comfortability thing and we could run more screens to get him open on the left side of the court.

Dennis, fortunately was much better on the right wing. This season he shot 29 shots from there and made 41%. He also likes to shoot from the top of the key, 72 shots on 24% shooting. He's also nice from the left corner but he only took 7 shots from there but shot 57%.

Dennis to me could really benefit from better three point shots. Dude has all the tools to be a shooter, whether you believe it or not. I do think that Dennis and Russ have some overlap tho in types of threes they like to take. So they and Billy will have to work a lot to make it work when they're on the floor together.

**got all my charts at nbasavant.com, which apparently doesn't link me to shit**

--- 

Again, we could use some shooting. I think if Ferg, Jerami and Paul can stay around 37-38%, if Russ can get to 32-33%, Keep Dennis at 34% and get a guy that can be a specialist in the 39-41% range, that'd be awesome. And if Nader/2Pat come back to be a major contributor at 35-37%, that would be a lot helpful.

I don't tend to think we need a team of shooters. We just need guys that can space a floor when Russ or Dennis is on it. We also need our guys to take better shots.","We don't just need shooting, we need better shot selection I want to draft a shooter, too. I really do.

Preface 

I think Donovan is a bad NBA coach and has been from day 1. I want to express some of my thoughts regarding why I feel Donovan is not a good NBA coach, by expressing some of the ways he has done a bad job each season. If you disagree, feel free to let me know what points you disagree with. 

I want to establish that I believe Billy Donovan was an excellent college coach and is the same coach in the NBA as he was in college. However, the NBA and college basketball are completely different and the qualities of being a good NCAA coach don’t necessarily translate to being a good NBA coach. Haralabos Voulgaris has made this point in general and specifically about Billy Donovan when he repeatedly talked about how Donovan was a poor NBA coach during the 2015-2016 season. Donovan’s best strength has always been his recruiting. He’s got a great personality and his players seem to love him. He won 2 NCAA titles with Al Horford, Joahkim Noah, Corey Brewer, and Maurice Speights on his team. These were all elite recruits that became NBA players and likely would not have considered going to Florida had Donovan not been an excellent recruiter. His recruiting elevated Florida as a basketball program and while it didn’t help OKC keep Durant, it may have helped them keep PG.  

That being said, recruiting is far less of a factor in the NBA, its why NCAA legends like John Calipari, Rick Pitino, and many other great college coaches have not succeeded in the NBA, where Xs and Os are far more important. Billy Donovan, who is a disciple of Rick Pitino, falls into the category of coaches that succeeded in college but struggled in the NBA due to the greater emphasis on strategic capability. If one goes back and watches Donovan’s offensive and defensive schemes at Florida, they’ll have a better understanding of why OKC never evolved schematically under Donovan. In retrospect, he was a bad hire and there’s no reason he should still be coaching the Thunder. Now, for a season by season breakdown of some of the issues I’ve seen beyond the obvious failure to revamp OKC’s offensive schemes in a substantive way.  

2015-2016 Season

The 2015-2016 season is often cited in defense of Billy Donovan’s coaching acumen, but I don’t quite understand why. The 2015 regular season was a nightmare. Billy’s rotations were, as they continue to be, questionable at best. This was a legit championship level roster with 2 top 5 players and the most depth of any of Donovan’s rosters. This was an all-time good team that somehow won only 55 games. This has been a common theme of the Donovan era, teams significantly underperforming their potential. 

Anyone that remembers this season probably remembers that the Thunder had arguably the best starting 5 in the NBA with a net RTG at ridiculous + 17.8/100 possessions, GSW was +14/100. The Thunder primarily struggled to win more games due to 1. Typical odd lineup choices and rotations that we have seen throughout Donovan’s tenure as coach and 2. A bunch of 4th quarter collapses. Its worth noting that the thunder’s crunch time offense, which was often maligned, was not the issue, as the defense cratered from an already meh 12th in the league overall to what would have been by far the worst in the league. It is also worth noting that Donovan chose to close with his best defender, Andre Roberson, on the bench. Going in to the playoffs, most people had considered Donovan’s first season a very poor showing. I remember Haralabos Voulgaris openly mocking Billy Donovan throughout the season on the Bill Simmons podcast. Also, members of the down to dunk podcast questioned him and Royce Young described the season as a “learning experience” for Donovan. 

Ultimately, the 2016 playoffs made people forget about the regular season. However, the playoff run is a bit overrated.  They beat a decimated Mavs team that had no chance in the first round, and while the Spurs series was probably Billy’s best coaching performance in the NBA, the 67-win Spurs, while 12 wins better than the Thunder, were clearly less talented than the Thunder and only possessed such an edge in wins due to coaching. Finally, the playoffs ended in another collapse continuing the Thunder season long trend of collapsing, though I don’t blame Donovan as much as I blame a combination of bad luck (Game 6 Klay), some poor shooting from Russ and KD in games 6 and 7, and the complete disappearance of the Thunder role players. I do, however, blame Billy for future playoff failures as I’ll mention soon enough.

2016-2017 Season 

Donovan’s coaching this season was egregiously bad and covered up by the Russ MVP tour and crazy clutchness. Donovan’s use of random lineups that did not make sense throughout the season was seemingly ignored because it was a “transition” season or season of “experimentation.” However, Donovan never thought of experimenting with giving Victor Oladipo minutes at backup PG as we were instead left with Semaj Christon, the worst player in the NBA at the time, receiving heavy minutes tanking the team. After the trade deadline, the Thunder had one of the best starting lineups in the NBA after replacing an out of position and horribly misused Domantas Sabonis with Taj Gibson (+11.8/100 possessions). For some reason, it took a few games for Taj to start and he didn’t receive enough minutes in the regular season, but I was hopeful that Billy would ride the starters in the playoffs. That didn’t happen.

People excuse the first-round loss to the Rockets by suggesting that the Thunder never had a chance or the season was never going to end in anything other than a first-round defeat. The people that do criticize Donovan often point to the fact that the team completely tanked with Russ off the court in the series in part due to horrific bench lineups lead by Semaj Christon. Billy didn’t try an Oladipo bench lineup up until game 5, the last game of the season. It was already too late. This is a trend with Donovan that I’ll bring up again later.  However, I think one of the other big factors that often is ignored is that Taj Gibson only played 24 minutes per game in the series, which is just crazy given how good their starting 5 had been with Taj in the season, and how good Taj had been against Houston (+35.8 on/off net rtg). It was a really bad series for Donovan and given how bad he was in the regular season; I am surprised he remained coach. 

2017-2018 Season

This season brought more of the same with bad lineups from Billy. In particular, he misused Carmelo Anthony and Jerami Grant the entire year and adapted poorly to the Roberson injury. Regarding Melo, Melo was at his best working with the bench as it allowed him to utilize his ability to create shots in a high usage role, which was probably his only positive skill at the time. The Carmelo bench units actually had a positive net RTG. However, these lineups were rarely used despite early season success. I recall Fred Katz trying to explain this logic by saying that it was so that Melo wouldn’t have trouble readjusting to playing with the starters and switching between playstyles. 

The issue with this explanation is that the Thunder instead played Paul George bench lineups with 0 creators, which lead to the Thunder having some truly disastrous PG lead bench lineups (the Thunder’s two most played lineups PG+ bench lineups were a -18.6 and 17.5 /100 possessions). PG, while way better than Melo at the time, needed to be paired with a playmaker to excel. We saw what a huge difference having another playmaker with PG made with this year’s bench lineups as the Dennis Schroeder Paul George bench lineups faired very well. 

As for Jerami Grant, as a result of Melo being tied to the starters, Grant ended up being played at backup center where he was good offensively, but a train wreck defensively. A big part of his terrible on/off numbers (-4.4, among the worst on the team) and the bench struggles were due to Grant playing center. The 2 above mentioned disastrous PG bench lineups both featured Grant at center. He should have been given a chance at more minutes at the 4 with the starters like he did this season and he did to end the playoff series against the Jazz.

The other major mistake Billy made was adjusting post Roberson injury. The starters pre injury were + 13.5/100 possessions and rated as one of the best starting 5s in the league.  It’s well known that the team tanked post Roberson injury, but that is in large part to the fact that Billy played Ferguson(Ferguson+starters were 16.5/100 possessions worse than healthy starters) Abrines (10.8/ 100 possessions worse than healthy starters) and Brewer(Brewer+ starters were 11.2/100 possessions worse than healthy starters) heavy minutes as Roberson replacements. The only replacement that actually worked, Josh Huestis (Huestis starters were only 2.2/100 possessions worse than healthy starters) was not given enough of a chance. I am not saying that Huestis was good, but he fit the best and he was the least bad of a bunch of bad options. 

As for the playoffs, this was again a pretty clearly bad series for Donovan. Just like he waited way too long to bench Semaj Christon against Houston, he waited until Game 5 down 20+ points at home to finally bench Carmelo Anthony and play Grant with the starters. This lineup competed an all-time great comeback and likely would have been good enough to win game 6 had Melo not been -19 in another 26 minutes. I think the Thunder likely win the series if Melo had been used as a bench scorer and given limited minutes, and while some give Donovan a pass due to the difficulty of coaching Melo, Donovan’s failure to adequately deal with Melo cost the team the chance to win the series.

2018-2019 Season

Donovan had another bad year. He played Steven Adams far too many minutes. Given that one of the Thunder’s only two quality bench players was a backup center, it was inexcusable for Adams to be among the league leaders in minutes and 2nd among centers and it seemed to have a devastating effect on Adams as he was a shell of himself for half of the year. I am, however, more sympathetic to Westbrook and PG both being top 5 in minutes per game given the team’s lack of depth. 

Donovan also had his usual rotation issues. In particular, his use of, Nader was egregious. Nader, who torpedoed any lineup he played with (-14.8 on/off), acted as this year’s Semaj Christon. I’d also point out that this year’s Russ bench lineups struggled in part because they failed to ever find a consistent group for him to play with, and in part because Russ played a lot with Schroder and either Nader/Diallo/ lineups that just did not work. Of course, Russ declining also played a role in this. 

Also, Donovan should take heat for OKC somehow outdoing last year’s post Roberson injury collapse by going 12-13 post all-star break and falling from the 3rd to the 6th seed. They would have been 8th without either of Paul George’s miraculous game winners during that span. 

As for the series loss against Portland, this was probably Donovan’s most obvious playoff failure, as I’ve seen people that have supported him in the past, Coach Nick from BBall Breakdown and Matt Moore from action network, criticize him.  Simply put, the Thunder’s defensive scheme against Damian Lillard was an especially egregious failure because the blueprint of aggressively trapping Lillard to contain the Blazers offense and limit Lillard was already well known. It had been used in the past and in the two most recent Blazers series, both of which Lillard has struggled in.  

…

With all that said, I want to end on a positive not. Given that I am a Thunder fan and Donovan will almost certainly retain his job for at least one more year, I hope that he hires some excellent assistants that can help implement a better system, and help with rotation decisions and in game/series adjustments. Otherwise, Donovan has given me little reason to be optimistic.","Why I Feel Billy Donovan is A Bad NBA Coach

"- After all the media hubbub, Russ had a pretty solid exit interview that was kind of insightful. It depends on who you ask, but I thought it was best you could hope for from Russ. 

- Portland surprises a ton of people and end up getting to WCF. Without their star center, they seem to have hit another level. Even if they get swept, it will be ""understandable"" vs the reigning champs. If they can get one or two in GSW even better. Portland ended up being really good in the post season and no one thought it. 

- We get a little bit of sympathy cuz our two stars had/are having four procedures between the two of them. People will so don't make excuses, but to me, that's a reason. Paul has no shoulders, Russ barely has his off hand, and we struggle to look like something. As Jaylen Rose said, we should be pretty excited because this team had a ton of potential. Idk if it's bad to get this same exact team back plus Dre. We'll see but Russ and Paul having real procedures shows they had a lot going on. 

- Lakers still ain't shit so it's no way Paul hates his decision lol. 

- Meanwhile, Paul is a top three finalist for DPOY and MVP. I think if Giannis is mvp, Paul has an opportunity to be DPOY. I don't suspect Paul to win either, but the recognition is nice and again, gives this team something to rally around (and it feels like they like rallying around Paul). Again, does this happen to Paul in LA? Probably not. Also, a nice small-market win ( for us and bucks!). 

My hope moving forward is the Bucks win it all. And then Presti sees how to successfully put a team around Russ. 

For the off-season, like I said I wouldn't be surprised or even that mad if Presti brings the same exact team back cuz I mean...there was a lot left on the table. And aside from Pauls shoulders, we lost two big roles in Dre and Abrines. Both of them around = great wing depth which is where we faltered a lot this year. 

I'd love to see us draft a mature shooter but it looks like we won't. I'm open to Adams trades but Presti sees him as part of the core. I'm less into Dennis trades cuz I think he's a really good backup but would you send him and Dre to the Suns to get Ryan Anderson and Troy Daniels? Yea probably. So we'll see what happens. 

I'm yet optimistic. Would love to see Billy gone but that won't happen either. But again...we only sucked once Pauls shoulders gave out. You guys forget for the first month or two of the season Paul was ass and we were still winning games with elite defense.

"Hey guys, I'm a Mavericks fan and I'd say that OKC is my secondary team but I just wanted the opinion of you guys because you're more emotionally involved in the team and would have more informed opinions that me. 

&#x200B;

It's no secret that you guys don't have much freedom in terms of cap space and, of the big contracts you have, it only seems as if PG13 is putting up the numbers to justify his. 

&#x200B;

My question is, would you guys be open to trading Westbrook and Adams to build a more competitive team around PG13 in his prime? (This is assuming WB doesn't improve from last year) If WB doesn't improve, I'd be willing to bet that his contract would easily be the worst in the league. The way that things are looking, it appears that until OKC can bring in 1 or 2 more pieces they won't be able to ever venture past the 1st or 2nd round of the playoffs. 

&#x200B;

I know how much Westbrook means to the Thunder and Oklahoma and his loyalty shouldn't be dismissed. I'm lucky as a Mavs fan because Dirk took pay cut after pay cut and never forced Mavs fans to think about it but if he was going to make 35+ million for the next 5 years at his current level of production while we were trying to build around a 28 year old Luka and KP, I don't know how I'd feel.

"I'm drunk.   

But the way the Bucks play is beautiful.  It's unlikely they lose this game, and although the Raptors are good, it's going to be hard for the Raptors to win four out of five against the way this Buck team plays.  

It's depressing because the Bucks are playing a style our GM is hesitant to run, and our GM has leveraged our roster in coaches and skill sets that are antithetical to what works now.  

We could have drafted Giannas, Middleton, and Broghdon.  These guys weren't drafted 1st, 2nd, or 12th overall.  Each of them were available to the Thunder (of course among other teams).  Middleton and Broghdon were second round picks.  We *had* drafted Bledsoe, traded him for nothing.  We had Ilyosova.  I love Grant, but we could have drafted Grant outright in 2014 and thus not have to give up Ilyosova (and a future first) for Grant.  

Brook Lopez was signed for 3 million.  There's no guarantee we could have signed him, but yeesh.  We were a better team last year than the Bucks.  

Giannas was the fourth leading scorer for the Bucks at halftime, used primarily as a facilitator and decoy.  When...have we used our stars as *decoys* to help get the supporting cast involved?  When have our coaches, Brooks and Donovan, even thought to do such things outside of the ""superstar + iso ball"" fixation?  

The Bucks play better defense than we do, yet they don't have a bunch of guys (sans Giannas) with 12' wingspans.  The have a bunch of shooters and a jitterbug point guard...yet they play great defense.  Huh.  Whoever heard of such a thing?!?  

Their players just stay with their man.  Novel concept.  Don't double team and don't prioritize picking off passing lanes.  Stay with your man possession after possession, and your opponent will shoot for shit throughout the course of the game.  Gamble and get out of position, trying to anticipate every pass or double teaming every entry pass into the post...and your so called good defense because very much Swiss cheese over 48 minutes.   

The two best teams playing right now have the cheapest role playing centers, in the Bucks and Warriors.  The Raptors have an expensive center in Gasol, and the Blazers had a pre-buyout expensive center in Kanter, but right now the Blazers, Warriors, and Bucks use centers that take up little cap space.  

Oh and we could have hired their coach if we fired ours last year.  

Anyways what 6'8 wing with 14' wingspan and a 17.2% three point percentage, or traditional defensive first ""great if it was 1985"" big man are we drafting this year?

"Currently CBS has us taking Kevin Porter Jr. I'm half a fan, half not. He could be a top 10 player, or he could be a total bust. He reminds me of the hype with Perry Jones, which did not work out well for us.

Ty jerome is another good player in our area. A 6-5 PG, he could make the transition to SG with relative ease and be a good backup PG if we trade schroeder (big if). He long, can defend, and can shoot from 3. He's personally my top choice

Admiral Schofield is one I was honestly surprised to see so low. He was a huge reason Tennessee had the #2 seed in the tournament. A 40% 3 point shooter, and he has a tireless work ethic and motor that could rival Westbrook. He hustles, dives, does everything he can to get those 50/50 balls. Hes big, strong, and is older, which could be a short term asset. 

These are my personal top 3 favorites. Porter has the most upside, but also the most downside. I'm not sure I'd want to risk our pick on him. I think Jerome or Schofield could immediately produce for us, especially from 3 and on defense.

"With the news that Billy is being looked at as a top candidate for the Michigan job, I can’t help but think we would have to bring a replacement in pretty quickly before the draft if he were to take the job (which I think makes plenty of sense for him). Brett Brown may be out there soon, but Lue is clearly the best coach available right now and Presti needs to go all in on him. He’s coached a championship team and has been paired with championship coaching pedigree before (Phil, Doc). He’s also come across some great point guards (CP3, Rondo, Kyrie) so I think he and Russ could click really well. Not to mention he is a guy LeBron respects, which speaks volumes. 

The only reason Presti would pass on him may be that he isn’t very analytical. Lue is schematically good (see 2016 Finals) and can pick a part mismatches, but he isn’t going to play by the numbers as Presti likes to do. Also, he really didn’t get a chance to put his print on a post-LeBron younger team so I don’t think it’s fair to judge him before his firing. 

I made a post similar to this a few weeks ago. I think it makes too much sense. Lue is so much better with rotations and schemes compared to Billy. He’s also been around the league much longer and has comfortabiIity with superstars and egos. I also think he could bring in a good coaching staff and could really be a good leader for our team trying to crack the championship ceiling. 

Also, random fact he was raised close to Oklahoma. He was born and raised in Missouri, so it’s not like he wouldn’t have an interest in the location. I think the Lakers made a mistake lowballing him, but if Billy takes interest in Michigan, Lue would be the best option for our team going forward and where we want to be.","Tyronn Lue needs to be the next Thunder head coach; change my mind?

We tend to acknowledge Jerami a lot on this sub and Terrance not so much. He is subject to an inordinate amount of negativity and trade speculation. This is ridiculous, we cannot trade Terrance for virtually anything.

Terrance Ferguson hasn't been allowed to fail quietly. He has had so much pressure put on him to produce because Thunder are in win-now mode with two of the Top 15 players in the NBA on his team.  For young players this is an enormous challenge to their confidence. Being able to slowly adjust to the NBA without the pressure of expectation is big. Ferg has never had that luxury.

***Terrance is our Klay Thompson, whether we know it or not.***

*""Wait, what?! Are you drunk? Klay is a boss he strokes it, he cool and Ferg fouls a lot and and mishandles the ball..""*

Both SG, both 6'7, both have 6'9 wingspan, Thompson bigger frame, more modest athlete and Ferg slight frame, explosive athleticism.

Both have quick and high release shots, are unselfish players who pride themselves on their defensive assignments. Klay was probably better off the dribble, higher BBIQ and Ferg is a better finisher at the rim, with better physical attributes.

***You starting to see some similarities yet?***

Now we can start to compare and this is where it gets really, really interesting.  We can't truly evaluate Ferg's development until the full next season (age 21), but we can draw some conclusions and form some pretty clear development opinions.

Klay's age 21, Rookie season is as per below with season [highlights here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY01IPS1vo4);

**The Offensive Stats..**

Thompson has the scoring lead in PPG (12.5 vs 6.9), with a higher 3P% (41% vs 36%). All things considered, you would have probably assumed this anyway. But, it gets interesting when you factor in usage, Klay scored this on 10.9FGA vs 5.8FGA and 21% usage versus Fergs 10%. Oh and its even more interesting when you compare EFG% and TS%, Ferg is ahead here ***on both 55% EFG and 56% TS versus 52% and 54% for Klay.***

Ferg is a more efficient scorer than Klay overall, however on half the volumes and/or usage. This is understandable given their respective roles, Klay was a bigger part of the offence on a rebuilding team, while Ferg is a role player on a (wannabe) contender.

Ferg has the lowest usage % out of any Thunder player in the 2018-2019 season. He basically only averaged 6 touches a game, all shots in 25 minutes.

To confirm my suspicion, I did the research, ***when Ferg shoots the ball 8 or more times a game his 3PT% is 41% (25 games, 7.04 3PA), when he shoots it 4 or less times a game his 3PT% is 34% (28 games, 1.4 3PA).*** That is an absolutely elite volume and efficiency mark, there is a very clear link between increased volume and efficiency or 'rhythm' for Ferg. We need to get him more shots in 19 / 20.

Oh and just for reference against the Blazers this year in the Playoffs, he shot 39% from 3PT or 7 from 18. He was good shooting the ball when it mattered most. Something that no one has really raised or given him credit for, which isn't fair.

**The Defensive Stats..**

Look the first thing to acknowledge is that Klay is a fantastic All NBA level defender and Ferg isn't. But Klay wasn't always that good, [read here](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/sports/klay-thompson-warriors-defense.html). He recognised his role early and had to do work to become the primary on ball defender, it took him years of development to get where he is. Also if you watched the highlights, Klay has never had weak side help blocks or rim protection in his game.

However in saying that, Terrance is so far ahead in development on the defensive side of that ball it isn't even close.

[Klay Advanced Defensive Stats](https://i.redd.it/tlb3wm83xnx21.png)

[Ferg Advanced Defensive Stats](https://i.redd.it/8wzujf5jwnx21.png)

Well, well, well isn't this interesting. Ferg's advanced defensive metrics are outrageously ahead of 'The' premiere 3&D player in the league at their nearly equivalent seasons. For reference ***Ferg contributed nearly the same amount of defensive win shares as Klay did in 17-18, let alone in their early seasons!!!*** Also if you watched the highlights, Klay has never had weak side help blocks or rim protection in his game and that is Fergs immense athletic upside.

He clearly fouls too much averaging nearly a foul more per 36 versus Klay at similar ages. However, again this is where the years gap in age and development is key, a fact of life is as you mature and develop, you make better decisions (wrap it up you young-ins). Ferg will foul less this up coming season, making him a more impactful defender and scorer, because he can actually stay on the floor.

Expect him to also put on some size as he mentioned in his exit interview. If he puts on more size he will be more impactful as he wont get murdered by screens and can more effectively switch into the forward positions. He small right now, but when he big, he gonna be good.

***So uhh, how much are we paying the Next Klay?***

He made 2.1M this year and makes 2.4M next year, he is perfect for our capped out nightmare situation.

There is virtually no one in the league that could be better for how much we are paying. For reference Danny Green made 10M, Gary Harris made 16M and Klay made 18M.

Garry Harris is probably the best current comparison due to his youth and he is making seven times the amount Ferg is. Seven. Times. The. Amount.

The bar we are setting for Ferg is completely unfair because we are comparing him to some of the most impactful and historically good shooters ever at the SG position. He is producing more at a younger age, with greater expectations than Klay Thompson. He has fantastic mentors in Paul George, Russell Westbrook and Andre Roberson, something that cannot be understated.

***In Summary...***

Ferg could very well be the next Klay Thomspon, particularly when you look at the physical attributes, intangibles, raw and advanced stats. He has a lot to work on sure, but he is equally as an exciting prospect as Jerami, potentially even more so, because he is still so young.

We need to get Ferg more touches, shots and overall a larger role in 19 / 20. He is deserving and if we invest in him now, he could very well be one of the best 3&D players in the league in three to five years time.

He is our Klay Thompson.

If you guys had like say a Danny green and maybe bertans type shooters you would have won the title. I think next season the biggest key is not to panic and blow it up.

Adding Danny green type players would easily open spaces for Russ to drive or pass it out for threes. I think if you had like 2 more shooters you would’ve beaten the warriors.

I think you guys should feel unlucky on how everything panned out and the future looks bright.

"Y'all are about to be triggered, but I just had to say this. I've been thinking about the shortcomings of this team: the shooting, the inconsistency, etc, and really you can attribute a majority to Sam Presti. Up until this season, I really thought that he was a genius GM. The PG trade, Dennis Schroeder, Nerlens Noel, etc. were super solid. The only way he could have been better was to sign Lebron. However, after this season, I'm not so supportive of him. It seems as if year after year Sam Presti is just average, and dare I say mediocre. Then during the offseason he pulls off some major trade or significant signing and people seem to forget all his shortcomings as a GM. However, these signings/trades don't seem to address issues that the team has, they're just attention grabbing. I don't ever remember the last time he's drafted or signed a reliable, knock-down shooter since Kevin Martin. He overpays many players such as Steven Adams and underpays players who are useful to us. We're a team who's significantly into the luxury yet only won the same amount of playoff games as the Magic this season (and we were facing a Portland team that we swept in the regular season without their starting center while the Magic were facing the Raptors with Kawhi). Finally, the thing that really took me over the edge was the fact that Sam Presti basically confirmed that Billy Donovan was our coach. After all of this, maybe it's time that we as Thunder fans re-evaluate Sam Presti. He seems to be exactly what the definition of insanity is: doing the same thing over and over again in hopes that something will change. I hope I'm wrong. I hope that Presti trades and drafts for shooters like Bradley Beal, fires Billy Donovan, and pulls something out his ass and gets KD back and Popovich as our coach, but recent history says otherwise. I would not go as far as to fire him, as he is the reason behind all of our success, but he's also the reason for our recent disappointment. I greatly appreciate everything he's done, as he basically made the Thunder a relevant team in the NBA, but if things don't turn change in the post KD era, ownership should think twice about extending his contract as GM.","I'm Gonna Get So Much Shit for This Y'all are about to be triggered, but I just had to say this.

I would not go as far as to fire him, as he is the reason behind all of our success, but he's also the reason for our recent disappointment. I greatly appreciate everything he's done, as he basically made the Thunder a relevant team in the NBA, but if things don't turn change in the post KD era, ownership should think twice about extending his contract as GM.",53,0,I'm Gonna Get So Much Shit for This,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/bmhqhk/im_gonna_get_so_much_shit_for_this/

The Stat's here prove that Patrick Patterson is the weakest link out of these 4, I have no clue if Morris will resign, if he doesn't though, the comparison between him and Burton are not even close, the only stat Patterson has him in is rebounding, and this isn't taking into account he played the 2-3 in these games aswell, so he had less opportunities inside. 

&#x200B;

Burton has shown that he can be a big part in our team, and by keying in on games where he actually got minutes, it shows he is deserving of taking those minutes. He does everything well, and his ability to play 2-4 fits perfectly with this team. I don't ever see him becoming an all out superstar, but his ability to impact the game in so many ways should not be unnoticed. He's too good to waste his potential on, and with minutes, he'll prove his skills.

"1. We can continue on the path we have been down for 3 seasons now which is to put the team completely in the hands of Russell Westbrook and live with the results. Going through Russ is full of highs, lows, but most importantly inconsistency. One game Russ can play elite basketball where he's looking for his teammates, taking high-quality smart shots, and is most importantly in control throughout. The next game is the worst of Russ where he takes ill-advised shots, seems out of control and is seemingly unaware of his shortcomings (Game 2, 4, & 5). The problem with Russ is that he has not been held accountable since KD left because the entire organization has seemingly simply been thankful that he decided to stay and is afraid to upset him and is happy to just live with whatever he does. He has also never been questioned seriously throughout his time when KD was here and since KD left OKC. The 1st year after KD left he won MVP, the next year most of the blame was put on Melo, and then PG signed an extension which I feel made Russ feel like his playstyle was validated since PG decided to return. After this series, this is the first time where I feel he is almost unanimously being questioned for his playstyle. I hope PG has a real heart to heart talk with Russ where he tells him that he can't play this way and expect to win. PG is the one person I feel Russ will listen to because he truly sees him as an equal and someone who he actually respects. He might see it as someone who chose to stay with him wanting what is best for both of them. This leads into option number two which is for Russ to become option number 2.
2. Westbrook is still an immensely talented player but it's safe to say that he is on the decline. His fg%, ft%, and 3p% all declined this season and it just simply is not possible to win a championship led by someone this inefficient. His decision making, especially in big situations, is also simply not good enough to consistently get a good result. Becoming the second option to PG also means that Russ must be held accountable for his mistakes in the big time/late game situations. He can no longer turn the ball over or take an ill-advised shot without being told that was a bad decision. The biggest reason I feel he hasn't changed in 10+ years is that no one in the organization has held him accountable. He's been able to operate free reign because he's been so good or people just thought he'd eventually figure it out. This accountability starts with the head coach and Billy is just simply not the guy. I know it looks like he's gonna return but I don't see any way Russ changes under Billy and I'm still holding out hope he's let go. When PG was the number 1 and Russ was number 2 early in the season, we were legitimately competing for the number 1 seed in the west. Obviously, a lot of things contributed to our downfall such as the defense falling apart and PG's shoulder giving out, but we saw the blueprint for this team. Paul George was a top-five player when healthy this season and if Russ can resolve his decision making as well as improve his shot, he is a top 10 player in this league. If these two can figure out their respective roles and the defense returns there is no reason this team should be going out in the 1st round. 
3. The third option is for this team to blow it up and rebuild. You would certainly get assets for PG and Russ, and some minor assets for Steven. The problem is that there is no guarantee these picks we get would result in any elite draft picks. I personally believe this option should be 100% off the table. You draft for the chance to get two elite players like Russ and PG so there's absolutely no reason to trade them just to hope to get lucky enough to basically get them again. That's just giving up in my eyes and saying as a front office we're not capable of finishing the job and making the moves to get us over the hump.

I know now that the season is over, everyone has been attacking Billy Donavan for his coaching (well deserved) and Sam Presti for not building a good enough team. However, I believe these playoffs fall mostly on Westbrook. Game 1 was on PG and our abysmal shooting, but games 2-5 Russ was the major factor.  In the 2nd half of game 2 with the game teetering between the two teams, Russ shot 2-7 with 5 turnovers. In game 3 he was spectacular and was the biggest reason for our win. And in games 4-5, Russell got into a 1 on 1 battle with Damian Lillard instead of trying to win the game and we lost both games. In those last 2 games, he shot 5/21 (24%) with 3 turnovers and 11/31 (36%) with 5 turnovers. Both of those were winnable games if Russ performed better and we would be up 3-2 going back to OKC if he did perform up to his ability. Would the series have been easier if we had shooters or if Billy was a better coach? Yes, but our team and its talent were good enough to win that series. Looking back to when we picked up Markieff Morris, the general consensus among us as well as NBA reporters and analysts, was that this team was good enough to go to the conference finals.  We didn't even make it out of the first round against a team who lost its 3rd best player. Many of us look at Westbrook as the 1st or 2nd best point guard in the league. We put him above guys like Curry, Irving, and Lillard. But I'm gonna pose the question of if we had any of those 3 guys in that series instead of Westbrook would we have won that series? I believe yes which is why I say Russ was the biggest reason we did not win that series. I'm not saying he was our worst player but if you want the title of superstar point guard, you have to perform like it in the playoffs. He's more talented than all three of those other guys but he simply just isn't on their level when it comes to the IQ and mental part. I believe he can fix it and if he does, I truly believe we can compete with the elite teams in this league.","Our team can go in three directions 1. We can continue on the path we have been down for 3 seasons now which is to put the team completely in the hands of Russell Westbrook and live with the results.

2. Westbrook is still an immensely talented player but it's safe to say that he is on the decline. His fg%, ft%, and 3p% all declined this season and it just simply is not possible to win a championship led by someone this inefficient. His decision making, especially in big situations, is also simply not good enough to consistently get a good result. Becoming the second option to PG also means that Russ must be held accountable for his mistakes in the big time/late game situations. He can no longer turn the ball over or take an ill-advised shot without being told that was a bad decision. The biggest reason I feel he hasn't changed in 10+ years is that no one in the organization has held him accountable. He's been able to operate free reign because he's been so good or people just thought he'd eventually figure it out. This accountability starts with the head coach and Billy is just simply not the guy. I know it looks like he's gonna return but I don't see any way Russ changes under Billy and I'm still holding out hope he's let go. When PG was the number 1 and Russ was number 2 early in the season, we were legitimately competing for the number 1 seed in the west. Obviously, a lot of things contributed to our downfall such as the defense falling apart and PG's shoulder giving out, but we saw the blueprint for this team. Paul George was a top-five player when healthy this season and if Russ can resolve his decision making as well as improve his shot, he is a top 10 player in this league. If these two can figure out their respective roles and the defense returns there is no reason this team should be going out in the 1st round. 
3. The third option is for this team to blow it up and rebuild. You would certainly get assets for PG and Russ, and some minor assets for Steven. The problem is that there is no guarantee these picks we get would result in any elite draft picks. I personally believe this option should be 100% off the table. You draft for the chance to get two elite players like Russ and PG so there's absolutely no reason to trade them just to hope to get lucky enough to basically get them again. That's just giving up in my eyes and saying as a front office we're not capable of finishing the job and making the moves to get us over the hump.

I know now that the season is over, everyone has been attacking Billy Donavan for his coaching (well deserved) and Sam Presti for not building a good enough team. However, I believe these playoffs fall mostly on Westbrook. Game 1 was on PG and our abysmal shooting, but games 2-5 Russ was the major factor.  In the 2nd half of game 2 with the game teetering between the two teams, Russ shot 2-7 with 5 turnovers. In game 3 he was spectacular and was the biggest reason for our win. And in games 4-5, Russell got into a 1 on 1 battle with Damian Lillard instead of trying to win the game and we lost both games. In those last 2 games, he shot 5/21 (24%) with 3 turnovers and 11/31 (36%) with 5 turnovers. Both of those were winnable games if Russ performed better and we would be up 3-2 going back to OKC if he did perform up to his ability. Would the series have been easier if we had shooters or if Billy was a better coach? Yes, but our team and its talent were good enough to win that series. Looking back to when we picked up Markieff Morris, the general consensus among us as well as NBA reporters and analysts, was that this team was good enough to go to the conference finals.  We didn't even make it out of the first round against a team who lost its 3rd best player. Many of us look at Westbrook as the 1st or 2nd best point guard in the league. We put him above guys like Curry, Irving, and Lillard. But I'm gonna pose the question of if we had any of those 3 guys in that series instead of Westbrook would we have won that series? I believe yes which is why I say Russ was the biggest reason we did not win that series. I'm not saying he was our worst player but if you want the title of superstar point guard, you have to perform like it in the playoffs. He's more talented than all three of those other guys but he simply just isn't on their level when it comes to the IQ and mental part. I believe he can fix it and if he does, I truly believe we can compete with the elite teams in this league.",16,0,Our team can go in three directions,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/bljpzh/our_team_can_go_in_three_directions/

"I wrote the following as a comment on another post and thought it merited its own thread. Below is a list of every resource OKC can use to improve its roster this summer, along with the financial constraints, plus my thoughts on the sort of moves that make sense for the team. 

Here are the salary resources we have as of today:

* No cap space (so we can only sign free agents using exceptions, of which there are three we can use:)
* A $10.9M trade exception which expires on July 25th (and a $1.5M trade exception that expires next February)
* Taxpayer mid-level exception ($5.7M)
* Unlimited veteran minimum exceptions. [You can see the projected scale here](https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/info/minimum_scale), which ranges from $897k (0 years of experience) to $2.5M (10 years of experience). 

We can't use the biannual exception because we're above the luxury tax apron. 

#Cap Situation:
We currently have $148M in 2019-20 salary cap commitments, [per Spotrac](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/oklahoma-city-thunder/cap/2019/). That figure includes some cap holds that will probably go away (Noel's $2M, Morris's $1.6M, maybe Felton's $1.6M), but we won't get much of that money back because of incomplete roster charges. 

**Can we avoid the tax?** Probably not. The luxury tax threshold is $132M, so we'd need to cut roughly $16M in cap space to get out of the luxury tax. That's unlikely, and it would almost surely require us to punt on improving the roster in the name of saving money. Given that we have a 2-year window with PG, I don't see that happening.  

**Can we create cap space?** Almost surely not, barring a full roster teardown and rebuild. The projected salary cap is $109M, so we'd have to cut ~$39M in salary just to get to the cap. If we somehow traded everyone but Russ and PG and took on no salary in return, those two alone make ~$71.5M, which would give us just ~$38M to spend on the other 13 roster spots. 

**How bad will the luxury tax bite us?** Pretty damn bad. The projected luxury bill for our current 2019-20 salaries is $50.4M, which I believe would be the largest in luxury tax history. Because we're in the repeater tax (since we've paid the luxury tax too many times in recent years), each additional dollar we spend results in a multiple of that dollar added to our tax bill. To illustrate, our projected $50.4M tax bill results from $16.5M spent above the cap, so we're spending roughly $3 in luxury tax for each $1 we add in salary. The luxury tax multiplier becomes increasingly punitive the more you spend. Bottom line: if we add more salary, it'll cost the team 4-5 times as much as the listed salary, so a $5M player would cost the team $20-25M. That means we're unlikely to spend on marginal veterans.

Please note: Presti did a masterful job of reducing our tax bill over the course of the summer and the season, and I expect he'll find ways to do it again this season. 

#Trade Exception:
We created a $10.9M trade exception when we dumped Melo's contract. This trade exception can be used to acquire a player (or players) via trade or waiver claim whose salarie(s) do not exceed $10.9M. If you want to see a list of every player who fits, [click this link](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/), sort by the ""2019/20"" column, then scroll down to #78 Tony Snell. Snell and every player below him on the list could be absorbed into our trade exception. 

Please note that trade exceptions **cannot** be combined or combined with additional salary in order to bring back a player making more than the exception. We cannot use the trade exception to acquire a player making more than $10.9M. 

**How could we use the trade exception?** Teams often need to clear cap space during free agency, and clearing cap space is often expensive because you have to find another team that's willing to sacrifice its own cap space (e.g., by not sending any salary back). We can offer to create up to $10.9M in cap space for another team in exchange for either a player we want or a draft asset. 

**Why wouldn't we use it?** Because we are in the luxury repeater tax, adding $10.9M in salary would cost us something like $60M, so we would either need to love the player we're acquiring or receive significant draft compensation. Thus, don't be surprised if we either let this trade exception expire or only use a portion of it. For example, we might acquire another young guy like Nader who would otherwise be waived to create a roster spot. 

We have a second trade exception available: $1.5M for the TLC trade, expiring 2/1/20. That exception is so small that it could only be used to acquire a young player who makes next-to-nothing, like Nader last year. 

#Taxpayer Mid-Level Exception (MLE):
**How does it work?** Three basic uses:

1. The MLE allows us to sign a player for up to $5.7M in the first year of the contract. The MLE can be split between multiple players (e.g., sign one guy for $3M, sign another for $2.7M). 
2. We can use part of our MLE to sign second-round picks or UDFAs to 3-year minimum contracts, which would make them RFAs with Bird Rights at the end instead of UFAs. That's what we did with Deonte Burton, and we could use it for Kevin Hervey, Devon Hall, etc. 
3. We can save some or all of the MLE and use it to outbid other teams on the buyout market.

The taxpayer MLE is our best shot at retaining Noel. If he opts out of his minimum deal as expected, we could offer him up to $5.7M to stay. 

Using the full MLE would cost us $20-25M because of the luxury repeater tax (unless we significantly trim our tax bill). 

#Veteran Minimum Exception:
Finally, we can round out our roster using the veteran minimum exception, which allows us to sign as many players as we have roster spots, but only to [minimum deals](https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/info/minimum_scale). That's how we got Noel and Felton in previous years. Signing a veteran would cost us far more than the listed contract because of the luxury repeater tax, so a $2M player would cost the team closer to $10M. 

#Trade Assets:

Assuming we don't trade Russ or PG, here are the 2019-20 salaries of our remaining players:

* Adams: $25.8M  
* Schroder: $15.5M  
* Roberson: $10.7M  
* Grant: $9.3M  
* Patterson: $5.7M  
* Ferguson: $2.4M  
* Nader: $1.6M (non-guaranteed)  
* Burton: $1.4M (non-guaranteed)  
* Diallo: $1.4M

**Salary matching rules** for teams above the luxury tax state that you can receive **up to 125% of outgoing salary** in any trade. Hence, Schroder can be traded for incoming salaries totaling up to ~$19.4M. If we traded Adams, Schroder, and Roberson together, we could bring back up to $65M in salary. Note that such a trade could involve multiple teams, and the only rule is that total outgoing salary must match total incoming salary (so we could ship Adams, Schroder, and Roberson off to three separate teams in the same transaction and receive up to $65M in total salary back, regardless of how much salary each individual team sends us). 

Here are the **salaries for some prominent players who could conceivably be traded this summer** (some of these are pure speculation on my part):

* Blake Griffin: $34M  (distressed asset with alarming contract)
* Gordon Hayward: $32.7M  (distressed asset with alarming contract)
* Mike Conley: $32.5M  (rebuilding team)
* Kevin Love: $28.9M  (distressed asset with alarming contract)
* DeMar DeRozan: $27.7M  (I dunno, maybe the Spurs realize he's not that good?)
* Anthony Davis: $27M  (RICH PAUL!!!)
* Bradley Beal: $27M  (If he's supermax eligible and Washington doesn't pay him, he'll demand a trade)
* Jrue Holiday: $26.1M   (Could shake loose if AD is moved)
* George Hill: $18M  (meh)
* Gary Harris: $17.8M  (Might be redundant in Denver)
* Evan Fournier: $17M  (who knows?)

If I were Presti, my priorities would be:

* Explore replacing Adams with a center who shoots 3s
* Find another forward who can shoot, preferably a playmaker (Blake = best case scenario)
* Find another 2-way wing who can shoot
* (If Schroder is traded) Find a backup point guard who can shoot

One fun scenario would be a three-team trade that sends out Adams and brings back Blake Griffin. We could slide Grant to the 5 (not ideal, but beggars can't be choosers). 

#Draft Assets: 
OKC has one pick in this draft: first round, 21st pick. Here are the players taken with that pick this decade:

* Grayson Allen
* Terrance Ferguson
* DeAndre' Bembry
* Justin Anderson
* Mitch McGary (ugh)
* Gorgui Dieng
* Jared Sullinger
* Nolan Smith
* Craig Brackins

That's a lotta yikes! I count a grand total of one useful rotation player, with apologies to Bembry and Allen. 

We don't have a second-round pick this year because of the Diallo trade, but second rounders can be bought on draft night. Philadelphia, for example, has three high second-round picks this year and a recent history of selling extra picks. Buying a pick would be an efficient use of money for OKC because the money they spend would not be subject to the luxury tax. 

I don't know how the draft board will play out, and this draft is notably weak after the top two picks. That said, I think Presti should look to add a big man, preferably one who can pass and shoot. The odds of finding an impact wing are low and we already have more prospects than we can play (Ferguson, Diallo, Nader, Burton). Hitting on a playmaking, shooting big man would elevate this roster the way Patrick Patterson was meant to. 

Please note that, while the next first-round pick we can trade isn't until 2024, we could trade #21 on draft night by selecting a player on behalf of another team and then trading that player's draft rights. Perhaps Presti could package #21 and a player together to move up in the draft and pick a player he covets? 

#Bottom Line:
The most likely path to a significant roster upgrade is the trade market, because we aren't in a position to acquire much talent via free agency. This is a deep free agent class, however, so it's entirely possible that quality players will be available for the MLE or the veteran minimum (a la Noel and Cousins last year). I expect Presti will make multiple trades this summer.","Comprehensive List of Assets & Potential Offseason Moves I wrote the following as a comment on another post and thought it merited its own thread.

That's how we got Noel and Felton in previous years. Signing a veteran would cost us far more than the listed contract because of the luxury repeater tax, so a $2M player would cost the team closer to $10M. 

#Trade Assets:

Assuming we don't trade Russ or PG, here are the 2019-20 salaries of our remaining players:

* Adams: $25.8M  
* Schroder: $15.5M  
* Roberson: $10.7M  
* Grant: $9.3M  
* Patterson: $5.7M  
* Ferguson: $2.4M  
* Nader: $1.6M (non-guaranteed)  
* Burton: $1.4M (non-guaranteed)  
* Diallo: $1.4M

**Salary matching rules** for teams above the luxury tax state that you can receive **up to 125% of outgoing salary** in any trade. Hence, Schroder can be traded for incoming salaries totaling up to ~$19.4M. If we traded Adams, Schroder, and Roberson together, we could bring back up to $65M in salary. Note that such a trade could involve multiple teams, and the only rule is that total outgoing salary must match total incoming salary (so we could ship Adams, Schroder, and Roberson off to three separate teams in the same transaction and receive up to $65M in total salary back, regardless of how much salary each individual team sends us). 

Here are the **salaries for some prominent players who could conceivably be traded this summer** (some of these are pure speculation on my part):

* Blake Griffin: $34M  (distressed asset with alarming contract)
* Gordon Hayward: $32.7M  (distressed asset with alarming contract)
* Mike Conley: $32.5M  (rebuilding team)
* Kevin Love: $28.9M  (distressed asset with alarming contract)
* DeMar DeRozan: $27.7M  (I dunno, maybe the Spurs realize he's not that good?)
* Anthony Davis: $27M  (RICH PAUL!!!)
* Bradley Beal: $27M  (If he's supermax eligible and Washington doesn't pay him, he'll demand a trade)
* Jrue Holiday: $26.1M   (Could shake loose if AD is moved)
* George Hill: $18M  (meh)
* Gary Harris: $17.8M  (Might be redundant in Denver)
* Evan Fournier: $17M  (who knows?)

If I were Presti, my priorities would be:

* Explore replacing Adams with a center who shoots 3s
* Find another forward who can shoot, preferably a playmaker (Blake = best case scenario)
* Find another 2-way wing who can shoot
* (If Schroder is traded) Find a backup point guard who can shoot

One fun scenario would be a three-team trade that sends out Adams and brings back Blake Griffin. We could slide Grant to the 5 (not ideal, but beggars can't be choosers). 

#Draft Assets: 
OKC has one pick in this draft: first round, 21st pick. Here are the players taken with that pick this decade:

* Grayson Allen
* Terrance Ferguson
* DeAndre' Bembry
* Justin Anderson
* Mitch McGary (ugh)
* Gorgui Dieng
* Jared Sullinger
* Nolan Smith
* Craig Brackins

That's a lotta yikes! I count a grand total of one useful rotation player, with apologies to Bembry and Allen. 

We don't have a second-round pick this year because of the Diallo trade, but second rounders can be bought on draft night. Philadelphia, for example, has three high second-round picks this year and a recent history of selling extra picks. Buying a pick would be an efficient use of money for OKC because the money they spend would not be subject to the luxury tax. 

I don't know how the draft board will play out, and this draft is notably weak after the top two picks. That said, I think Presti should look to add a big man, preferably one who can pass and shoot. The odds of finding an impact wing are low and we already have more prospects than we can play (Ferguson, Diallo, Nader, Burton). Hitting on a playmaking, shooting big man would elevate this roster the way Patrick Patterson was meant to. 

Please note that, while the next first-round pick we can trade isn't until 2024, we could trade #21 on draft night by selecting a player on behalf of another team and then trading that player's draft rights. Perhaps Presti could package #21 and a player together to move up in the draft and pick a player he covets? 

#Bottom Line:
The most likely path to a significant roster upgrade is the trade market, because we aren't in a position to acquire much talent via free agency. This is a deep free agent class, however, so it's entirely possible that quality players will be available for the MLE or the veteran minimum (a la Noel and Cousins last year). I expect Presti will make multiple trades this summer.",172,239,Comprehensive List of Assets & Potential Offseason Moves,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/bkqnl9/comprehensive_list_of_assets_potential_offseason/

"Only Russ, PG and Grant are off the table. Schroder isnt giving enough production for his salary. Adams slumps hard every year and gets destroyed by pretty much all top centers while getting paid more than nearly all of them. 

Russell westbrook needs a team full of shooters. hes stuck with a 90's team in a league that shoots 3's. How can you expect success?

How about getting a backup for George? This team needs to re-tool seriously. This bench is tragedy. 


If Russ could shoot well yeah alot of those mistakes could be covered up. But if we're really banking on that then I can no longer believe the team os focused on winning. 

Since we're capped out we don't have a choice but to go for big trades or hope that we can get serious values out of minimum salary players. We have a better chance trading a huge haul for someone like Beal who would improve the team in multiple ways.

He's an excellent shooter and was looking like a fringe MVP candidate for most of the season. He can playmake so backup pg would be less of a factor if donovan could learn to stagger minutes properly between ryss, pg and beal. 

Beal and Adams are getting paid similarly. We're not getting hardly any of that value for Adams compared to what Beal is capable of.  He is 100% worth trading a ton considering that ton isnt doing much at all. we can sign and trade our pick, ferguson adams and schroder and get back one of the wizards contracts that they want to get away from. If you want this team to succeed it needs shooting. Russ is a t9p 5 passer in this league with barely anyone to pass it to.

I don't really like the popular mock pick, Tyler Herro. It just seems pretty underwhelming to me and too obvious. I don't think they're going to draft a shooter.

"First of all, no roster moves will matter if Billy Donovan isn’t fired. He has shown the lack of the abilities to use timeouts effectively, manage rotations(see the minutes Noel, Morris, Nader played last year), solidify a solid offensive strategy, or get the guys to buy in and play hard for him. The way I see it, if Billy is fired, the roster can be improved to the point of bringing a ‘ship to Loud City. I think there are 4 tiers of OKC players right now as far as the offseason goes:

The Untouchables:
Russell Westbrook: Yes, Russ had a bad season. The idea of trading him is still absurd. He is an elite PG, and is on a mega-contract. Russ is an MVP-Caliber player, loyal to the city, and is a great teammate and recruiter. He is a talented player, though he may not be what he used to be. With that said, the roster isn’t constructed around him well enough. He needs consistent shooters around him, and with the exception of PG and Jerami, we lack that. Even if OKC wanted to trade Russ(which we shouldn’t), it’s highly unlikely that we would get a good return. There aren’t really any teams that would want to trade for a 30 year old superstar with a massive contract, and if there were, they wouldn’t be able to produce a return that would be worthwhile for OKC. 

Paul George: MVPG, ‘nuff said. But actually, there is even less of an argument to trade PG than there is Russ. He complements Russ’ play style, can score from anywhere, is an elite defender, is a great leader, and has shown his loyalty to OKC. 

Jerami Grant: Remember when Presti turned Serge Ibaka, Anthony Morrow and Cam Payne into Oladipo, Ilyasova, McDermott, Taj and Enes, and then turned that into PG, Dennis, TLC and Jerami? It’s crazy to think that in that sequence, OKC not only got a superstar in Paul George, but got Jerami as well, who has emerged as an incredible role player. Jerami is young, on a cheap contract, and can shoot, drive, rebound and defend at above average levels. On top of that, he brings an insane amount of energy, something that OKC has lacked consistently. Jerami is a player that I would feel comfortable playing the 3 or 4 spot(the 5 is a stretch but maybe) and can run well with the first and second units. He’s a valuable asset, and should be kept on the roster. 
The Expensive Contracts:
Steven Adams: Steven Adams is a good basketball player. Steven Adams doesn’t fit well with Russell Westbrook. They both need to play around the rim on offense, and thus it’s really easy for teams to just leave a big man near the paint and shut off the two of them. Keeping Steve isn’t the worst, but he’s on an expensive contract, and he just doesn’t make sense in our offense. Still being young, I think a team would be willing to take on Steve’s salary in exchange for his talent, and perhaps even give up a shooting vet(Kevin Love, Trevor Ariza, Marc Gasol,etc) for him. Steve can be traded for talent, or to clear some cap space, so I think he would be a prime player to trade.

Andre Roberson: Dre is an enigma. On paper, we shouldn’t need him. He can’t shoot, and he plays really good D, just like Ferg and Hami, but he’s older and on a bigger contract. With that said, OKC’s play without him in this last year and a half has undoubtedly been worse because he wasn’t on the court. Maybe it’s his energy, maybe it’s his chemistry, I’m not sure. Either way, he has an expensive contract, and it is unknown as to whether or not he will come back better or worse than he was, but the idea of having Dre back excites me. Maybe it’s just because I’m sentimental, but I want to keep Dre and see what he ends up being. With that said, I think most other NBA fans would agree that the Thunder should trade him to either clear up cap space or pick up a shooter. 

Dennis Schroeder: I would rather have Dennis on the roster than Melo any day, and I’m extremely appreciative of the trade that we got him in. With that said, he doesn’t fit. He’s inconsistent, can’t shoot well, and makes a lot of sloppy plays. A dollar store Russ if you will. I do think that lots of teams will be enticed by the idea of picking him up. Dennis can fetch  assets for his talent, and can also be used to clear cap space. Dennis for a cheap shooter excites me, and I think he’s the player on the roster most likely to be traded away.

Patrick Patterson: Pat isn’t actually an expensive contract, but he fits into this category because he is paid much more than what he is worth. If he keeps playing the way he has been, he isn’t worth 5 million. If gets the playing time that he has earned(which is 0), especially with the potential of keeping Keef, he should be traded, maybe with another asset, to clear some cap space. I don’t think any team is going to actively want him, but a team like the Knicks or Hawks might give up an excess guy or take on Pat’s salary in exchange for a pick.
The hot commodities:
Terrance Ferguson: I think an appropriate nickname for Ferg would be ‘Flash’, both for his amazing athleticism, and the fact that he showed flashes of being a really good player, but nothing super consistent. I could see Ferg developing his shot and becoming a really good 3 and D player. I could also see him plateauing. With his young age, I do think he will improve. However, I don’t think he will reach the needed level for him to be great for another 3-4 years. Plenty of teams are willing to wait this out, and would give up good players to get Ferg. Ferg is the best player on the roster for years down the line, but if we want to win now, we should trade Ferg for a shooter. 
Hamidou Diallo: Hami is the Presti special. Athletic, good defender, can’t shoot…. Hami has shown the ability to make athletic plays, and be an explosive defender. Coupled with his young age, and win at the dunk contest, I think other teams will be intrigued by Hami. While he is a good player, and someone I want in the future, I don’t think we’re planning to win in the future, but to win now. If we can get a shooter for Hami, although it’s def a short term payoff and a long-term loss, I think getting rid of Hami is the way to go.

Deonte Burton: There’s not much known about Burton yet. He has shown the ability to score, he’s young, and on a cheap contract. I think this will intrigue other teams, and a team like the Cavs or the Bulls may be willing to take a shot on the young wing in exchange for a role player. 


The ‘eh’ guys:
Nerlens Noel: I really like Nerlens. He’s a high energy guy, and has shown the ability to play solid defense and give good effort on the offensive end. With that said, he’s still semi-young, and on a favorable contract. I either want to extend him, and if he won’t sign an extension, see if we can get some pieces in return for the talented center on a steal of a contract.

Abdel Nader: I don’t think anyone really knew what to expect out of Nader coming into OKC. He was a late second round pick, and didn’t perform too well in Boston. With that said, I think Nader’s stock has risen slightly, but is still a question mark. He has shown flashes of really good play, and flashes of pretty poor play. He’s a guy that I would like to have on the roster to see if he will improve, but if someone is willing to overpay for him, I have no objection to shipping him. 

With that said, here are 4 trades that I think could improve OKC going into 2019-2020.



Trade 1:
Cleveland Gets- Steven Adams, Dennis Schroeder, Hamidou Diallo, OKC 2019 first round pick
OKC Gets- Kevin Love, Jordan Clarkson, Cedi Osman


This trade is high risk, high reward. Kevin Love has faced a lot of injury problems, yes. With that said, he is only 30, played ball with Russ at UCLA, and is a career .370 shooter from 3. The addition of Love provides an all-star caliber big man who can space the floor, and someone who already has chemistry with Russ, and who can hopefully work with Russ to make adjustments. The question is what Love will be. Will he be the dominant rebounder who can shoot the 3 that he used to be? Or will he be a slow liability with bad legs. It’s a high risk, but a risk I think we should take. Aside from Love, OKC picks up two young role players. Cedi and Clarkson can both shoot the ball okay, and would be a nice spark to have come off the bench, or to trade along to clear cap space(Clarkson) or get some assets for a young player(Cedi.) I think this trade is really good for OKC, the problem is getting Cleveland to accept it. Cleveland is in a state where it should be rebuilding. With Sexton as their PG of the future, they will assumedly take Zion if they have the first pick, or RJ if they have 2 or 3(but it’s Dan Gilbert so who fucking knows.) With that said, Schroeder comes in as a talented vet who can help mentor Sexton, or that Cleveland can trade along for more picks. Steve is 4 years younger than Tristan, and gives Cleveland the option to use him as part of their rebuild, or trade him, like they should Thompson, JR Smith, and Love. Finally, Diallo and a first round pick should have enough future upside to close the deal. With this trade, and re-signing the active roster, we look like this:

Russ
Dre
PG
Jerami
Love

Bench:
Clarkson
Cedi
Ferg
Keef
Nerlens
Burton
Nader

Overall, on a A+ to F scale, I think this trade earns:

Roster Improvement: B+
Realistic: B



Trade 2:
New Orleans Gets- Steven Adams, Terrance Ferguson, Hamidou Diallo, OKC 2019 first round, OKC 2021 first round, OKC 2020 second round 
OKC Gets- Anthony Davis

This is the balls on the table play from Presti. Davis is an elite center. He can shoot. He fits super well. The problems are that it’s both a super risky trade for OKC, and that a lot needs to go right outside of OKC’s control. For one, we could trade the farm, not win the championship, and then have AD walk, and be gutted for the future. Outside of the huge risk from OKC, they need NOP to not get a better offer. I think the Celtics, Lakers, and Clippers can all give NOP better offers than OKC can. Steve is an ok get for them, and the young guys are good if they want to rebuild, but we don’t have the star power like Brandon Ingram/Kuzma or Jason Tatum that NOP will likely be offered for AD.  Presti would both have to want to make this move, and NOP would need to receive no other offers, both of which are very unlikely. With this trade, and re-signing the active roster, we look like this:


Russ
Dre
PG
Jerami
AD

Bench:
Dennis
Burton
Nader
Keef
Noel


Roster Improvement: A-
Realistic: D+

Trade 3:
Washington Gets- Steven Adams, Dennis Schroeder, Patrick Patterson, Terrance Ferguson, OKC 2019 first round, OKC 2021 first round
OKC Gets-Bradley Beal, Ian Mahinmi, Wesley Johnson

First things first, this deal is contingent of Wes commiting to a sign and trade. With that said, I think this trade makes a lot of sense. Washington has no direction right now. While taking on Schroeder isn’t ideal for them, the rest of the deal makes a ton of sense. They get rid of some hefty contracts, get Steve to pair with Wall, get Ferg as a young guard, and get two picks to start building for the future. It allows them to choose between trying to compete now(Dennis and Steve with John Wall), or trying to rebuild(possibly keep Steve, trade away Dennis and Wall.) OKC gets an elite SG in Beal, and a solid bench player in Wes. Mahinmi is a serviceable C, but I think Nerlens has the talent to be a good big man, and will beat Ian out for the spot. This leaves OKC without a true PG from the bench(besides Ray, but hopefully he’s not getting many minutes), but the offense should be able to run smoothly through Beal, PG, or Wes when Russ is off the court. With this trade, and re-signing the active roster, we look like this:

Russ
Beal
PG
Jerami
Nerlens

Bench:
Wes
Dre
Nader
Keef
Mahinmi

Roster Improvement: A-
Realistic: B+



Trade 4
Boston gets- Steven Adams, Dennis Schroeder, Terrance Ferguson, Patrick Patterson, OKC 2019 first round, OKC 2021 first round
OKC gets- Gordon Hayward, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris(sign and trade)


If the celtics lose Kyrie, they could have to pivot. They could possibly look to go younger and build around Brown, Ferg, Adams and Tatum. The idea of uniting Marcus Morris and Keef is attractive, especially with Marcus being able to space the floor well. This deal would involve a sign-and-trade for Marcus, likely with him and Keef taking pay cuts to play together. OKC gives up a lot with 2 first rounders and Ferg, but this trade seems otherwise hard for Boston to accept. It also eaves OKC small at the Center position, and leaves us in a position where we either start Marcus at the 5 when we can afford to, and start Nerlens when we need to defend a big man(Nurkic, Jokic, etc.) This deal would also incentivize OKC to go out and try and find a center who would take a pay cut, such as Brooke Lopez, Javale McGee, or Boban. With this trade, and re-signing the active roster, we look like this:

Russ
Hayward
PG
Jerami
Noel/Morris

Bench:
Jaylen
Dre
Nader
Keef
Noel/Morris


Roster Improvement: A
Realistic: C



Sam Presti isn’t one to show his cards, but when he said that he didn’t want to make major changes in his presser, it seemed like he meant it. He has shown that he trusts Billy(God knows why) and he seems contempt with the roster as is. My prediction is no changes, and another 1st round exit in 2020, but I’d love to be surprised, and hopefully Sam makes a move.","I didn’t want to write for class so I did this instead: First of all, no roster moves will matter if Billy Donovan isn’t fired. He has shown the lack of the abilities to use timeouts effectively, manage rotations(see the minutes Noel, Morris, Nader played last year), solidify a solid offensive strategy, or get the guys to buy in and play hard for him. The way I see it, if Billy is fired, the roster can be improved to the point of bringing a ‘ship to Loud City. I think there are 4 tiers of OKC players right now as far as the offseason goes:

The Untouchables:
Russell Westbrook: Yes, Russ had a bad season. The idea of trading him is still absurd. He is an elite PG, and is on a mega-contract. Russ is an MVP-Caliber player, loyal to the city, and is a great teammate and recruiter. He is a talented player, though he may not be what he used to be. With that said, the roster isn’t constructed around him well enough. He needs consistent shooters around him, and with the exception of PG and Jerami, we lack that. Even if OKC wanted to trade Russ(which we shouldn’t), it’s highly unlikely that we would get a good return. There aren’t really any teams that would want to trade for a 30 year old superstar with a massive contract, and if there were, they wouldn’t be able to produce a return that would be worthwhile for OKC. 

Paul George: MVPG, ‘nuff said. But actually, there is even less of an argument to trade PG than there is Russ. He complements Russ’ play style, can score from anywhere, is an elite defender, is a great leader, and has shown his loyalty to OKC. 

Jerami Grant: Remember when Presti turned Serge Ibaka, Anthony Morrow and Cam Payne into Oladipo, Ilyasova, McDermott, Taj and Enes, and then turned that into PG, Dennis, TLC and Jerami? It’s crazy to think that in that sequence, OKC not only got a superstar in Paul George, but got Jerami as well, who has emerged as an incredible role player. Jerami is young, on a cheap contract, and can shoot, drive, rebound and defend at above average levels. On top of that, he brings an insane amount of energy, something that OKC has lacked consistently. Jerami is a player that I would feel comfortable playing the 3 or 4 spot(the 5 is a stretch but maybe) and can run well with the first and second units. He’s a valuable asset, and should be kept on the roster. 
The Expensive Contracts:
Steven Adams: Steven Adams is a good basketball player. Steven Adams doesn’t fit well with Russell Westbrook. They both need to play around the rim on offense, and thus it’s really easy for teams to just leave a big man near the paint and shut off the two of them. Keeping Steve isn’t the worst, but he’s on an expensive contract, and he just doesn’t make sense in our offense. Still being young, I think a team would be willing to take on Steve’s salary in exchange for his talent, and perhaps even give up a shooting vet(Kevin Love, Trevor Ariza, Marc Gasol,etc) for him. Steve can be traded for talent, or to clear some cap space, so I think he would be a prime player to trade.

Andre Roberson: Dre is an enigma. On paper, we shouldn’t need him. He can’t shoot, and he plays really good D, just like Ferg and Hami, but he’s older and on a bigger contract. With that said, OKC’s play without him in this last year and a half has undoubtedly been worse because he wasn’t on the court. Maybe it’s his energy, maybe it’s his chemistry, I’m not sure. Either way, he has an expensive contract, and it is unknown as to whether or not he will come back better or worse than he was, but the idea of having Dre back excites me. Maybe it’s just because I’m sentimental, but I want to keep Dre and see what he ends up being. With that said, I think most other NBA fans would agree that the Thunder should trade him to either clear up cap space or pick up a shooter. 

Dennis Schroeder: I would rather have Dennis on the roster than Melo any day, and I’m extremely appreciative of the trade that we got him in. With that said, he doesn’t fit. He’s inconsistent, can’t shoot well, and makes a lot of sloppy plays. A dollar store Russ if you will. I do think that lots of teams will be enticed by the idea of picking him up. Dennis can fetch  assets for his talent, and can also be used to clear cap space. Dennis for a cheap shooter excites me, and I think he’s the player on the roster most likely to be traded away.

Patrick Patterson: Pat isn’t actually an expensive contract, but he fits into this category because he is paid much more than what he is worth. If he keeps playing the way he has been, he isn’t worth 5 million. If gets the playing time that he has earned(which is 0), especially with the potential of keeping Keef, he should be traded, maybe with another asset, to clear some cap space. I don’t think any team is going to actively want him, but a team like the Knicks or Hawks might give up an excess guy or take on Pat’s salary in exchange for a pick.
The hot commodities:
Terrance Ferguson: I think an appropriate nickname for Ferg would be ‘Flash’, both for his amazing athleticism, and the fact that he showed flashes of being a really good player, but nothing super consistent. I could see Ferg developing his shot and becoming a really good 3 and D player. I could also see him plateauing. With his young age, I do think he will improve. However, I don’t think he will reach the needed level for him to be great for another 3-4 years. Plenty of teams are willing to wait this out, and would give up good players to get Ferg. Ferg is the best player on the roster for years down the line, but if we want to win now, we should trade Ferg for a shooter. 
Hamidou Diallo: Hami is the Presti special. Athletic, good defender, can’t shoot…. Hami has shown the ability to make athletic plays, and be an explosive defender. Coupled with his young age, and win at the dunk contest, I think other teams will be intrigued by Hami. While he is a good player, and someone I want in the future, I don’t think we’re planning to win in the future, but to win now. If we can get a shooter for Hami, although it’s def a short term payoff and a long-term loss, I think getting rid of Hami is the way to go.

Deonte Burton: There’s not much known about Burton yet. He has shown the ability to score, he’s young, and on a cheap contract. I think this will intrigue other teams, and a team like the Cavs or the Bulls may be willing to take a shot on the young wing in exchange for a role player. 


The ‘eh’ guys:
Nerlens Noel: I really like Nerlens. He’s a high energy guy, and has shown the ability to play solid defense and give good effort on the offensive end. With that said, he’s still semi-young, and on a favorable contract. I either want to extend him, and if he won’t sign an extension, see if we can get some pieces in return for the talented center on a steal of a contract.

Abdel Nader: I don’t think anyone really knew what to expect out of Nader coming into OKC. He was a late second round pick, and didn’t perform too well in Boston. With that said, I think Nader’s stock has risen slightly, but is still a question mark. He has shown flashes of really good play, and flashes of pretty poor play. He’s a guy that I would like to have on the roster to see if he will improve, but if someone is willing to overpay for him, I have no objection to shipping him. 

With that said, here are 4 trades that I think could improve OKC going into 2019-2020.



Trade 1:
Cleveland Gets- Steven Adams, Dennis Schroeder, Hamidou Diallo, OKC 2019 first round pick
OKC Gets- Kevin Love, Jordan Clarkson, Cedi Osman


This trade is high risk, high reward. Kevin Love has faced a lot of injury problems, yes. With that said, he is only 30, played ball with Russ at UCLA, and is a career .370 shooter from 3. The addition of Love provides an all-star caliber big man who can space the floor, and someone who already has chemistry with Russ, and who can hopefully work with Russ to make adjustments. The question is what Love will be. Will he be the dominant rebounder who can shoot the 3 that he used to be? Or will he be a slow liability with bad legs. It’s a high risk, but a risk I think we should take. Aside from Love, OKC picks up two young role players. Cedi and Clarkson can both shoot the ball okay, and would be a nice spark to have come off the bench, or to trade along to clear cap space(Clarkson) or get some assets for a young player(Cedi.) I think this trade is really good for OKC, the problem is getting Cleveland to accept it. Cleveland is in a state where it should be rebuilding. With Sexton as their PG of the future, they will assumedly take Zion if they have the first pick, or RJ if they have 2 or 3(but it’s Dan Gilbert so who fucking knows.) With that said, Schroeder comes in as a talented vet who can help mentor Sexton, or that Cleveland can trade along for more picks. Steve is 4 years younger than Tristan, and gives Cleveland the option to use him as part of their rebuild, or trade him, like they should Thompson, JR Smith, and Love. Finally, Diallo and a first round pick should have enough future upside to close the deal. With this trade, and re-signing the active roster, we look like this:

Russ
Dre
PG
Jerami
Love

Bench:
Clarkson
Cedi
Ferg
Keef
Nerlens
Burton
Nader

Overall, on a A+ to F scale, I think this trade earns:

Roster Improvement: B+
Realistic: B



Trade 2:
New Orleans Gets- Steven Adams, Terrance Ferguson, Hamidou Diallo, OKC 2019 first round, OKC 2021 first round, OKC 2020 second round 
OKC Gets- Anthony Davis

This is the balls on the table play from Presti. Davis is an elite center. He can shoot. He fits super well. The problems are that it’s both a super risky trade for OKC, and that a lot needs to go right outside of OKC’s control. For one, we could trade the farm, not win the championship, and then have AD walk, and be gutted for the future. Outside of the huge risk from OKC, they need NOP to not get a better offer. I think the Celtics, Lakers, and Clippers can all give NOP better offers than OKC can. Steve is an ok get for them, and the young guys are good if they want to rebuild, but we don’t have the star power like Brandon Ingram/Kuzma or Jason Tatum that NOP will likely be offered for AD.  Presti would both have to want to make this move, and NOP would need to receive no other offers, both of which are very unlikely. With this trade, and re-signing the active roster, we look like this:


Russ
Dre
PG
Jerami
AD

Bench:
Dennis
Burton
Nader
Keef
Noel


Roster Improvement: A-
Realistic: D+

Trade 3:
Washington Gets- Steven Adams, Dennis Schroeder, Patrick Patterson, Terrance Ferguson, OKC 2019 first round, OKC 2021 first round
OKC Gets-Bradley Beal, Ian Mahinmi, Wesley Johnson

First things first, this deal is contingent of Wes commiting to a sign and trade. With that said, I think this trade makes a lot of sense. Washington has no direction right now. While taking on Schroeder isn’t ideal for them, the rest of the deal makes a ton of sense. They get rid of some hefty contracts, get Steve to pair with Wall, get Ferg as a young guard, and get two picks to start building for the future. It allows them to choose between trying to compete now(Dennis and Steve with John Wall), or trying to rebuild(possibly keep Steve, trade away Dennis and Wall.) OKC gets an elite SG in Beal, and a solid bench player in Wes. Mahinmi is a serviceable C, but I think Nerlens has the talent to be a good big man, and will beat Ian out for the spot. This leaves OKC without a true PG from the bench(besides Ray, but hopefully he’s not getting many minutes), but the offense should be able to run smoothly through Beal, PG, or Wes when Russ is off the court. With this trade, and re-signing the active roster, we look like this:

Russ
Beal
PG
Jerami
Nerlens

Bench:
Wes
Dre
Nader
Keef
Mahinmi

Roster Improvement: A-
Realistic: B+



Trade 4
Boston gets- Steven Adams, Dennis Schroeder, Terrance Ferguson, Patrick Patterson, OKC 2019 first round, OKC 2021 first round
OKC gets- Gordon Hayward, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris(sign and trade)


If the celtics lose Kyrie, they could have to pivot. They could possibly look to go younger and build around Brown, Ferg, Adams and Tatum. The idea of uniting Marcus Morris and Keef is attractive, especially with Marcus being able to space the floor well. This deal would involve a sign-and-trade for Marcus, likely with him and Keef taking pay cuts to play together. OKC gives up a lot with 2 first rounders and Ferg, but this trade seems otherwise hard for Boston to accept. It also eaves OKC small at the Center position, and leaves us in a position where we either start Marcus at the 5 when we can afford to, and start Nerlens when we need to defend a big man(Nurkic, Jokic, etc.) This deal would also incentivize OKC to go out and try and find a center who would take a pay cut, such as Brooke Lopez, Javale McGee, or Boban.

"here's my take, A lot of our players have voiced that they like Billy Donavan. Personally, I want to see the team succeed and I want to see Westbrook (as a starter in his prime) succeed as well.

I think Westbrook is still in love with his MVP season. and after 3 years I think we need someone who can harness Westbrooks abilities and also be the team leader everyone can rely on. Gregg Pop is a great example of this, and anyone who plays for him knows he's in charge.

anyway, if we're keeping billy, maybe he can get everyone to realize that they need to rely more on his methods. because I don't think that's happened during his time with us.","Who would replace Billy Donovan? here's my take, A lot of our players have voiced that they like Billy Donavan. Personally, I want to see the team succeed and I want to see Westbrook (as a starter in his prime) succeed as well.

"Anyone wanting to turn on Presti on here are out of their minds (I’ve seen a couple comments). He has a love affair with long defensive wings who can’t shoot, sure, but I don’t think he’s blind to the fact that that’s not working and is no longer a need. He knows we need shooters better than any of us. 

He has been an absolute wizard for us. We lost arguably the best player in the league for nothing and he’s kept us in it (with Russ 👊🏼) for every year since then. KD leaving would be catastrophic for most franchises, and not even in the year immediately afterwards were we close to a bottom feeder. He has managed that situation immaculately. 

Looking at post KD only, which is ignoring 90% of what he’s done for the organization, he brought us Dipo and drafted Bonis who were valuable and exciting to us in the first year, and then turned them into Paul fucking George! He got Melo which had a shot to be great, and then managed to dump that contract for next to nothing after letting it run its course. That might be the most incredible thing hes done. He identified Grant before he had proven anything and got the wing he was looking for in Ferg. He snagged Schroeder and Noel this past offseason, and those were terrific pickups. We had exciting depth this entire season. 

I do not like Donovan. I do not trust Donovan. I have given up on Donovan. I trust Presti.

[You hear that sound?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f702GzF1x7s) You see that crater sitting where Thunder Alley used to be? Oh lookit, the Thunder went from not making it past the first round to not making the playoffs. A complete implosion all thanks to pure utter incompetence.

&#x200B;

Let's be realistic, do you honestly think this is going to be anything but that very result considering the fucking depth of the Western Conference? Don't be surprised if that's going to be the next headline for mid-April of next year. This coach does nothing while there are THREE other teams looking to get into the race.

&#x200B;

Dallas: Strong young core, versatile, adaptable bench, and a powerful coach who demands respect, big three in Burke, Doncic, Porzingis.

Sacremento: Strong young core, fairly strong bench, versatile, no-bullshit coach, has at least 3 young stars in development in Hield, Fox, and Bagley.

Lakers: Improving roster, Revenge Bron, fresh voice in a new head coach, hiring a competent team president, a potential power play for AD, and if that fails, they can trade up.

&#x200B;

Compare that to the Thunder's predicament: Ageing stars, love Westbrook but he's on the wrong end of 30 now with all those knee surgeries, PG's got serious shoulder issues and it's probably going to get even worse trying to carry this team from irrelevance, disgruntled roster, unorganized rotations, no in-game adjustment plans, a playoff team so defensive it can be considered as a doormat, a playoff team so offensive it could be waving hello to a woman in Manhattan and get called out for ""cat-calling"". This is a team that no other free-agent would even remotely be interested in joining because of this decision. You can't even trade parts of this roster without it backfiring because the pieces they trade off would go to drastically better teams with much better NBA coaches. The development staff has done nothing since Billy showed up. Name one good piece that was developed in his name. Cameron Payne? Semaj Christon? Terrence Ferguson? Can't take credit for Sabonis cause he got traded to the Pacers. Can't take credit for Adams since his postseason stats DECLINED since 2016. 

Hmm... I wonder what else happened that year.

You're looking at a cap hell situation so damn bad that the MLB owners would laugh at the irony. You wanna shed the cheap label, Presti? Well you did just that and look where the second most expensive roster has gotten you in the past three years. Jack. Fucking. Shit. Oh hey, one of those words are longer than the other two, perfectly represents the length of the playoff runs within that time span. 

&#x200B;

You want to give me hope for the future as a fan, TANK THE SEASON AWAY! That's right, wholesome intentional losing for those key early first round draft picks. Piss Westbrook and PG away, you're gonna do it anyways under this coach, might as well have a bed and breakfast after the eminent skull-fucking.

"We are in our 'mea culpa' moment, we are not as good as we think we are. We all feel, as I'm sure the organisation does that something needs to change. We got beat by an injured Blazers team in 5, who is a clear talent level below GSW, HOU, MIL & TOR. 

From a player and talent perspective, there is not much we can do that raises our ceiling. We are capped out and in win-now mode. I have covered what I think is our single biggest move we can make here, [Dwayne Dedmon, the prototypical modern NBA stretch five](https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/bhsn5z/what_is_the_biggest_possible_move_we_can_make_in/) (Al Horford lite). 

This only helps provide the capability to unlock the most from our existing roster. It is not a move that puts us so clearly ahead on talent that coaching becomes less important, arguably it reduces our talent, just adjusts our style. We ultimately need to apply our roster in the best possible way, particularly in the Playoffs.

Billy Donovan's track record in the NBA does not suggest he can achieve this. Why? Three first round exits, that is why.

**So What Do We Do?**

We can't simply ""FiRe BilLy DoNoVan"", we must recognise that if we make a major personnel change, is that going to make us, immediately and **substantially better.** 

There is major risk here, we have made the Playoffs consistently and the organisation as a whole is largely really successful. If we fire Donovan, we must be very confident that we can bring the right person or people into the organisation to bring the fabled Championship to OKC.

**Who is Going to Make Us Better?**

This is the hard thing with Coaches versus players. There is not something that is overtly quantifiable other than, length of experience, overall win record and Championships won. 

We need someone who can first and foremost adjust Russ' play style and decision making. That is the key must win battle, everything else will flow from that. **Get Russ to buy into the change and the Thunder change**.

Who can achieve that buy in, who can get him to play the facilitator role versus 'the guy' ? Someone who has Championship winning experience, that has managed superstar players offering an opinion when Russ is receptive to feedback (now, after three first round losses in a row to an under manned Blazers).

Because of win-now mode, with a hard headed face of franchise and city, we have a very short list of who can help us immediately.

**Alright, Alright, Who is Available that Makes Us Better?**

Pop, Kerr, D'antoni, Carlisle, Snyder and Stevens are all guys we would be confident saying they make our organisation better. Even Stevens has questions marks dealing with egos as we have seen with Celtics this year. None of these guys are going anywhere, we simply can't get them.

*""Yeah I know this already, tell me something I don't know - who is available?""*. In short, [virtually no one](https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2019/04/2019-nba-head-coaching-search-tracker.html) \- that is the problem we all need to recognise. 

There are a bunch of people available that all have glaring issues. With this roster we need a genuinely credible option who can get Russ and PG engaged and rebuild our offence. That rules out Joerger (has issues with players), Bickerstaff (no real track record of success) and Monty Williams (he has coached with us before, elected to not return). 

*""Great, we're fucked""* I hear you say.

Well, no, I think we have two options, [Ettore Messina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettore_Messina) or Tyronn Lue. 

**Really, Didn't Lebron Coach the Cavs and Who the Hell is That Other Guy?**

Tyronne Lue has grown in my eyes as more and more has come out on what he had to deal with at the Cavs. Dysfunctional ownership, arguably the two biggest egos in the NBA right now, Lebron and Kyrie and ultimately overcoming the best regular season team in history to win a Championship.

He actually kind of has everything we need, albeit a bit light on overall experience. He was a player and has Championship winning experience, but only with one team on a stacked roster. He hasn't showed over an extensive period of time he can be successful in multiple ways.

Oh and the other problem? I am almost certain the Lakers will hire him and he will want to go to LA.

**""Ok, fine, kinda didn't want him anyway, whatever, who is this** ***Eeeee-toooor-ayyyy*** **guy?""**

He is an associate coach with the Spurs, hand picked by Pop after being recognised as one of the best European coaches of all time after winning four Euroleague Championships.  Watch this and tell me he doesn't come across as a sharp basketball mind - [**https://youtu.be/9OG2xN1fwLw**](https://youtu.be/9OG2xN1fwLw)

*“The two more important things is that a team has to be willing to move the ball offensively and it has to be willing to work their butts off defensively,”* Messina says.

A team first, ball movement orientated disciplinarian in the Pop mould. Almost exactly what we need, he is almost Pop, at least as close as we are going to get to him. An extensive coaching resume, who has learned off one of the best coaches in NBA history, who has been entertaining a Head Coach positions for a while.

He is almost certainly our guy and we may be able to get him. 

***And therein lies the issue...***

We have one guy who you could realistically want. Who potentially has the option to take over the Spurs in the next few years and has interviewed for various other roles Head Coach roles, but have not eventuated. **He may not want to actually move.**

We can offer him a guaranteed role, with one of the most talented teams in the NBA, with the support of a great organisation and fanbase in a time everyone recognises something needs to change. The time is now, in our (second) darkest hour.

Go get Ettore Messina, for the sake of a structured offence, appropriate rotations, timely timeouts and a freshly improved Russ. 

....Or we run it back, with a largely unchanged roster and no definitive options for a better coach when Donovan's contract expires next year.

**Is Messina our saviour? Do we genuinely have a chance to get him? Do we wait Or do you say fuck it, get Russ to Player / Coach the team?**","What is the biggest possible change we can make in 2019 / 2020?

We need someone who can first and foremost adjust Russ' play style and decision making. That is the key must win battle, everything else will flow from that. **Get Russ to buy into the change and the Thunder change**.

Who can achieve that buy in, who can get him to play the facilitator role versus 'the guy' ? Someone who has Championship winning experience, that has managed superstar players offering an opinion when Russ is receptive to feedback (now, after three first round losses in a row to an under manned Blazers).

Because of win-now mode, with a hard headed face of franchise and city, we have a very short list of who can help us immediately.

**Alright, Alright, Who is Available that Makes Us Better?**

Pop, Kerr, D'antoni, Carlisle, Snyder and Stevens are all guys we would be confident saying they make our organisation better. Even Stevens has questions marks dealing with egos as we have seen with Celtics this year. None of these guys are going anywhere, we simply can't get them.

*""Yeah I know this already, tell me something I don't know - who is available?""*. In short, [virtually no one](https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2019/04/2019-nba-head-coaching-search-tracker.html) \- that is the problem we all need to recognise. 

There are a bunch of people available that all have glaring issues. With this roster we need a genuinely credible option who can get Russ and PG engaged and rebuild our offence. That rules out Joerger (has issues with players), Bickerstaff (no real track record of success) and Monty Williams (he has coached with us before, elected to not return). 

*""Great, we're fucked""* I hear you say.

Well, no, I think we have two options, [Ettore Messina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettore_Messina) or Tyronn Lue. 

**Really, Didn't Lebron Coach the Cavs and Who the Hell is That Other Guy?**

Tyronne Lue has grown in my eyes as more and more has come out on what he had to deal with at the Cavs. Dysfunctional ownership, arguably the two biggest egos in the NBA right now, Lebron and Kyrie and ultimately overcoming the best regular season team in history to win a Championship.

He actually kind of has everything we need, albeit a bit light on overall experience. He was a player and has Championship winning experience, but only with one team on a stacked roster. He hasn't showed over an extensive period of time he can be successful in multiple ways.

Oh and the other problem? I am almost certain the Lakers will hire him and he will want to go to LA.

**""Ok, fine, kinda didn't want him anyway, whatever, who is this** ***Eeeee-toooor-ayyyy*** **guy?""**

He is an associate coach with the Spurs, hand picked by Pop after being recognised as one of the best European coaches of all time after winning four Euroleague Championships.  Watch this and tell me he doesn't come across as a sharp basketball mind - [**https://youtu.be/9OG2xN1fwLw**](https://youtu.be/9OG2xN1fwLw)

*“The two more important things is that a team has to be willing to move the ball offensively and it has to be willing to work their butts off defensively,”* Messina says.

A team first, ball movement orientated disciplinarian in the Pop mould. Almost exactly what we need, he is almost Pop, at least as close as we are going to get to him. An extensive coaching resume, who has learned off one of the best coaches in NBA history, who has been entertaining a Head Coach positions for a while.

He is almost certainly our guy and we may be able to get him. 

***And therein lies the issue...***

We have one guy who you could realistically want. Who potentially has the option to take over the Spurs in the next few years and has interviewed for various other roles Head Coach roles, but have not eventuated. **He may not want to actually move.**

We can offer him a guaranteed role, with one of the most talented teams in the NBA, with the support of a great organisation and fanbase in a time everyone recognises something needs to change. The time is now, in our (second) darkest hour.

Go get Ettore Messina, for the sake of a structured offence, appropriate rotations, timely timeouts and a freshly improved Russ. 

....Or we run it back, with a largely unchanged roster and no definitive options for a better coach when Donovan's contract expires next year.

**Is Messina our saviour? Do we genuinely have a chance to get him? Do we wait Or do you say fuck it, get Russ to Player / Coach the team?**",28,34,What is the biggest possible change we can make in 2019 / 2020?

"I do not think Presti is firing Billy. I do think he *could* make a big trade but I could also absolutely see us making little tweaks.

And look guys. It's not all bleek.

We were a 2 seed without our best defender and with Russ playing like trash. We play out the season, and get hit with three things that I think are much larger than originally thought:

* The loss of Alex Abrines -- Look at the end of last season when he actually had very solid defense in the playoffs vs Utah. Look at the beginning of this season when it looked like his offensive package expanded. Not having a reliable wing like Alex was huge. All his shots went to an inefficient Dennis or an unproven rookie. 

* Dre never came back -- We were a top 5 defense without our most elite defender for a while there. Why is that important? Because we know our scheme works. Add in one of the most elite perimeter defenders and what do we look like? Keep in mind Dre said in exit interviews his tendon is healthy, it's his bone that fractured. Bone fractures heal like magic these days. I'm interested to know what he looks like after a year of rest on that tendon.

* Paul's shoulder sucked. We all know that's huge, but if we can get back to efficiency he had, then we may be okay. 

---

So what are some small things that I think could help for the above and some other stuff?

* Bring back Kendrick Perkins. He's obviously posturing for an assistant coaching job. I doubt if we have one but let's get him back around this organization. One thing I don't like about Billy/Russ/Sam is we seem to be too cool. We need some nasty back.

* Getting Dre back -- he doesn't look great when I see him on the sidelines cheering (he tends not to jump on that leg) but if that's more precaution than hurt, then cool. If Dre can get training camp and a preseason to get some confidence, that could be huge.

* Ferg to the bench -- I know I complain a lot about spacing and I do not think Dre helps us here at all, but I think there's value in having Ferg come off the bench as a shooter and maybe even a second playmaker (we'll see -- I think he developed a lot there this season). Ferg essentially becomes Alex Abrines.

* That would mean Russ has to get his shot back if Dre is next to him. Now here's the thing about Dre in the starting lineup -- he knows Russ and covers a *ton* of Russ' bad habits. Without Dre, Russ has to actually try on defense and I'd argue that's why Russ has kinda been ass offensively...Dre isn't there to cover his mistakes and Ferg is only a 2-year player. Even if Russ can get his cotton shot back, that makes us much better. Russ shot 20% from 3-10 feet this past season. That was 30% the last two seasons. That was 40% his last season with KD (and Ibaka). He shot 43% from 10-16ft (cotton shot) in his MVP year. Only 33% this year. That could make a huge difference. I don't suspect Russ to develop a 3, but even if he can be average, again that helps. Or just shoot all your threes from the corner, where he's 40%.

* What can Nader be? I know we don't want any more projects but Nader has a lot of raw talent. But you can kinda tell he only started playing basketball at 13. But honestly, for him I think it's just experience and making better decisions n the break. He can shoot, he can put the ball on the floor and when he has a rhythm, he can be solid defensively.

* Draft a 3-4 year college player with a shot. I don't pay enough attention to the draft, but we cannot afford to draft another skinny athletic freak with no shot. We really don't have a choice here -- draft someone with experience. No more babies, we got enough.

* Keep Markieff, let Noel walk. You guys will hate it but I think this is the right move. Keep Kieff as a stretch 5. Get him a summer with us (you guys forget he had that neck injury), let him get healthy, and he'll be better. Plus he likes it here. Give him 20 minutes a night. I will miss Nerlens defense and I think we won a ton of games just based off that, but you get some perimeter defense when you put Ferg in the game, and plus you could probably do some lineups where Kieff is at 4, Jerami is at 5 (he'd be first guy out for starters) for rim protection. 

* I do think you should kick the tires on what you can get for Steve. Maybe even what you can get for Dennis, but I tend to think you do one more run with Dennis. Something like Steve for Valuncinas and Avery Bradley -- Jonas can stretch the floor a bit, can still play nasty, is a little slow but he ain't Jokic. [i also realize this isn't that small of a thing to do]

* Incorporate some load management games. Someone said this earlier this season. Russ loves to play his 82 games and I think Paul is a lot the same -- after guys have big injuries they pride themselves on attendance. However for the past two seasons, we've ended with a PG surgery/procedure. I'm not as worried about Russ and I know Paul is a rhythm guy, but either we need to come down on their minutes or we need to give them some games off.

----

Ultimately, I just feel like so many things have gone wrong these past 3 years that I can see why it's hard for the organization to make a decision. Things are different in the playoffs and a defender like Dre helps, and a shooter like Alex helps. We can break down a lot of schematic things, but if Alex is there to shoot a 3 and Dre is there to stop two of their baskets, we win games 1 and game 5.

I feel like that's the way we're thinking. Is that the right way to think? I'm not sure. It worked for the Blazers. But there are a ton of scenarios where a coaching change worked for the rest of the league. So...I'm not sure...I think we'll see. 

We know we have two guys that can show up in the playoffs. Paul went toe to toe with LBJ in the East. Russ has had plenty phenomenal playoff performances in his 11 years. It's really tough to just brush off their past 2 years together and say 'they suck in the playoffs now, we need major changes'...it's tough. And I continue to say, we have to look at this as year one of the Russ + Paul only experience. And it wasn't *that* bad.

The exception can only be used on contracts not free agents, last a year from the initial trade date and count towards the salary cap but not the luxury tax. Extremely useful when trading a pick for a player as at least part of that players contract can be eaten up by the exception.
Buyout | Immediately paying the remainder of a players contract and removing them from the roster, a buyout has to be agreed to by both parties.
Waive | A team that waives a player has them removed from the roster but continues to pay their salary for it's remainder. Those players become Unrestricted Free Agents and are free to sign a new contract.

"They're all good players who excel in the roles they're supposed to play, contrary to what some folks on the sub seem to believe. Look at it this way:

Russ: the heart and soul. Like it or not, we're probably going to win or lose with the man. No point in really discussing trade scenarios, because it just isn't going to happen.

Ferg: he's 20 years old and already playing defense at a near elite level. Oh, he also hit the 3 at a 37% clip in his second year. There's no reason to expect him to do anything but improve for next year, meaning he's outplaying his contract. As cash strapped as we're going to be for this run, guys who can outperform their contract are going to be essential. 

PG: You won't find a better replacement, plain and simple.

Grant: Another guy who is, and should continue, to outplay his contract. Apart from that, he should also improve again next year. He's become a real three point threat and is already a fantastic defender. He's the prototype 3 and D stretch forward. His switching ability on defense is an invaluable asset in our current defensive system. Also, he's the only shot-blocker on the team. 

Adams: Probably underperformed for his contract, but he's one of the best at what he's asked to do (set screens, roll, and rebound). He's an underrated passer and should be utilized more as a post-up option. He's a good player, but he seemed to be playing hurt most of this year. He brings more to the team than the casual fan will ever understand.

To me, it would be a disaster to disassemble this starting 5 right now. They all actually fit together really well, and weren't the problem for most of the year. The bench, on the other hand, has to improve. I think at backup PG, you want an anti-Westbrook. A guy who can slow the game down a bit and control the tempo. Schroeder isn't a good fit, though he is a good player. I think you trade him for a shooter, get a rebounder (like Faried for Houston), and find a deliberate floor general point guard, and we're in business.

"Anyone who's seen me around your threads will know I'm not exactly Billy Donovan's biggest fan. I think, as a coach, he peaks at mediocre.

But here's the thing: He's not the Thunder's biggest problem.

Presti is.

Russell Westbrook, as a player, is: ""Shorter LeBron James with a *higher motor*."" As a slashing distributor, he is *elite*.

But the Thunder don't have shooters.

Take a look at this year's Lakers to see what happens if you have *actual LeBron* but no shooting to space the floor.

Westbrook takes too many three-point shots... because there's no spacing. He gets left open because he's not a great three-point shooter, but because they don't have enough *other* shooters, the opposing team can also defend the paint too much for him to be able to drive effectively.

Presti gets too much of a pass for the Paul George trade and a few good draft choices (not all of which he kept on the team). The roster construction for the Thunder has been a *massive* problem.

Get some shooters to space the floor and the Thunder could be real contenders with Westbrook to drive and kick and Paul George on the wing.

I doubt Presti will do it, any more than he'll look for an upgrade over his mediocre bestie coach.

"We have seen what Brook Lopez has done for the Bucks this year as a stretch five.

Well, well, well do I have a proposal for you, our very own Splash Moutain - [Dwyane Dedmon](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dedmode01.html). Making just 6,3M this year Dedmon, could potentially be had for <10M per year, a 38% 3PT shoot on nearly 3.5 attempts per game, shot 45% from corner threes in 2018 - 2019.

""...His combination of three-point shooting and overall efficiency is nearly unprecedented in NBA history. For a center to take more than 40 percent of his attempts from beyond the arc and post 60 percent true shooting (an elite mark league-wide) is something that’s only happened thrice in league history before Dedmon did it this year, by [**Miami’s Kelly Olynyk the last two years and Cleveland’s Channing Frye in 2016-17.**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&type=totals&per_minute_base=36&per_poss_base=100&season_start=1&season_end=-1&lg_id=NBA&age_min=0&age_max=99&is_playoffs=N&height_min=0&height_max=99&birth_country_is=Y&as_comp=gt&as_val=0&pos_is_c=Y&pos_is_cf=Y&c1stat=ts_pct&c1comp=gt&c1val=.60&c2stat=fg3a_per_fga_pct&c2comp=gt&c2val=.40&c3stat=mp&c3comp=gt&c3val=1000&order_by=ws)

To say Dedmon is the best defender among that group is a woeful understatement.

"Hi guys, I'm back for a bit.

The Lillard shot broke me, resulting into me logging out of all my social media accounts and unfollowing all basketball-related pages (NBA, BR, ESPN, OKC, Thunder players). It has been brutal. I feel like I've been shat both online and in real life. I was hurting just looking at r/nba but deservedly so.

In spite of it all, I couldn't help but lurk around this sub. I still love this team after all. *The exit interviews at least gave me some closure*. Now I'm prompted to return to Reddit after a few days.

-------->

Moving forward, here's my take:


1) I'm officially on the \#FireBilly train. I've defended him before but he really needs to go. I have faith that Presti has the balls to do this.


2) I'm also officially in the ""we need massive changes, but not blow it up"" club. As much as I loved all our players this season, something needs to be done starting with that fucked up cap.


3) I'm officially buying that our current roster construction is broken and there's no other way in today's NBA but build with shooters. I truly thought that defense would be our identity but I was dreaming and naive for thinking that we could replicate the 04 Pistons' success.


4) That being said, would it be wise to keep **a 1-2-3 core of Russ-PG-Grant**? Would this even be feasible? It hurts me to even type this because I love Adams so much and Dennis has been great for us this year. But sometimes I think that the only reason we're *almost obligated* to keep playing them as our main guys is because they are our highest paid players. Even when it's not working. And we fail to adjust, and then we lose. That Russ-Schroder backcourt combo in the 4th isn't the solution, imo. As good as they are individually, they're still two PGs who need the ball and our defense takes a hit.


5) Moving PG and Grant two positions down would give us height and length in almost 3 out of 5 starting positions already, provided we fill-in that gaping hole at PF and C who could both shoot. There's no other way to ""surround Russ with shooters"" than to have 4 out of 5 starters who have a respectable outside shot. That's why Steven can't stay, especially not at that salary. Idk who we replace them with, they don't necessarily have to be Brook fucking Lopez but at least someone who's a threat (at least a mid-range jumper).


6) We could package Dennis and Adams in a trade but I don't even know which team would be interested in them. Could Ferg develop into a 6th man? I truly believe Burton could be a rotational bench piece. Maybe Abrines could work on a return? And Roberson. A lot of ifs in this scenario but the overall point is we keep Russ, PG, and Jerami as our core.

"I’d love to trade Steve-O for Otto Porter straight up. Reason why: Steven has a hard time guarding on the pick and rolls off switches (some of that is the defensive scheme of switching on picks) but you can see that when we played grant at the 5, we actually defended the pick and roll much better. Teams with great shooting points off pick and rolls (Steph; dame; harden; etc) give Steven a hard time. Quite frankly, those are the teams we need to beat. I think we can afford to play small and have a lineup of Russ/t Ferg/pg/Otto/grant. When we play teams that have great bigs like KAT and Embiid, then we can start a bigger body. The latter doesn’t have to be offensively great—just a big body to box out/set screens/etc. I think we could probably draft a big man in this draft. 

Bringing in Otto helps us stretch the floor more. 

Steven does so many great things for us and it doesn’t go unnoticed—his post offense has drastically improved; he boxes our harder than 95% players in the league and does all the small things right (great roll dude) but I think it’s time to let him go. You can see in these last three playoffs, Steven got frequently exposed defensively. Furthermore he’s getting exposed against most traditional centers like Jokic and KAT (who frequently tear him up). The issue is that Steven is too laterally slow to defend guards off switches on screens—so either a) we need to change our defensive pick and roll philosophy or b) go small","Hot take trade idea I’d love to trade Steve-O for Otto Porter straight up.

"I see a lot of calls to fire Billy Donovan from a lot of Thunder fans. While admittedly, Donovan did a horrible job in each of the last two playoffs, which coaches currently looking for a job should replace him?

The current hottest coaching candidates are Tyronn Lue (who's likely going to the Lakers), Monty Williams, David Vanterpool, and Dave Joerger. All of these coaches, while maybe better than Donovan, also have been fired multiple times and each have serious flaws. While I understand that Donovan needs to go, would each of these coaches do a better job than Donovan currently does?

I think out of all of these, I like Dave Joerger the most--he did a good job with the Kings and turned around their culture. That being said, he's created friction between him and his star players/front offices in each of his last two stops, which is certainly cause for concern that he can't manage egos and personalities well, which would obviously cause problems in OKC. 

Monty Williams is kind of the opposite of Joerger--he's well-liked by everyone but never really overachieved or coached a winning team. Plus, his time in OKC ended tragically, so I kind of doubt he'll come back.

Tyronn Lue is likely headed to the Lakers.

As a Blazers fan, David Vanterpool is a fantastic guard development coach, and turned Lillard and McCollum into what they are today. Almost every single guard since he's been hired has played very well and improved their games when they were on the Blazers--he knows how to use guards and maximize their strengths while hiding their weaknesses, and he's been able to maximize the production of some very limited role players--Eric Maynor, Shabazz Napier, Nik Stauskas, Seth Curry, and Mo Williams were all bargain-bin backups with major flaws in their game yet contributed big time minutes. That being said, Vanterpool would be a rookie head coach without a lot of experience with game management or X's and O's and probably would be a better fit for a rebuilding team, rather than a team with already established stars trying to win now.

Anyways, I guess I was kind of wondering which of these coaches would actually be better than Billy Donovan. Obviously, you can't change things in hindsight--if you could, you probably would have fired Donovan last season and made a push to hire Budenholzer, but what's done is done. Is hiring one of these retreads really going to fix the Thunder's issues or substantially improve on Donovan? 

As an outsider, Billy Donovan's offense was really simplistic but generated the shots it was supposed to generate, but players for the most part didn't knock them down. Perhaps signing some shooters this offseason would alleviate a lot of the offensive problems.","If Billy Donovan gets fired, which coaches currently on the market should the Thunder look at to replace him? I see a lot of calls to fire Billy Donovan from a lot of Thunder fans. While admittedly, Donovan did a horrible job in each of the last two playoffs, which coaches currently looking for a job should replace him?

The current hottest coaching candidates are Tyronn Lue (who's likely going to the Lakers), Monty Williams, David Vanterpool, and Dave Joerger. All of these coaches, while maybe better than Donovan, also have been fired multiple times and each have serious flaws. While I understand that Donovan needs to go, would each of these coaches do a better job than Donovan currently does?

"It may be a bit of a reach but I would like to see them take Charles Bassey from Western Kentucky. I don't imagine Nerlens will opt in, so looking at the draft for a potential back-up big would be a good move for Sam Presti and the organisation.

Bassey is a 6'10 big man with an explosiveness and high motor which could thrive in a Russell Westbrook-led offensive system. He has shown at the college level that he has good rebounding and rim protection potential (helped by having a 7'3 wingspan), averaging 10 rebounds and 2.4 blocks per game respectively. There is a floor-spacer potential with Bassey as he shot 40% from deep (albeit on only 20 attempts for the season), as well shooting solidly from the mid-range area. He can also thrive by finding open space under the rim, and is a solid P&R roll man and lob-catcher.

Bassey could learn a few things from Adams and would excel under assistant-coach Mark Bryant - the long term goal being a potential replacement for the Big Kiwi down the road.

I see the Thunder's need for real shooters but I would feel more confident looking through free-agency or the G-League for a floor-spacer, rather than drafting a young shooter only for his skill to be sucked out of the mysterious black hole hovering over the 'Peake since forever.

But what do you think? Who would you like the Thunder to draft this year if they don't look for a trade on draft night?

"**Disclaimer; this is just my opinion. I don’t claim to be an expert at basketball or anything & if you have any arguments as to why he shouldn’t then I’m all ears**

Westbrook’s style of play just doesn’t anymore in the modern day nba. It centres around too much iso then drive and/or shooting a 3 (we all know how that goes). He has become too predictable and the other team just end up piling up the paint when he drives, resulting in either him having to kick it out or try force something. While sometimes this may have success, it’s not a winning formula.


WB is virtually stagnant when he doesn’t have the ball in his hand. OKC imo should have Dennis at the 1 and have him facilitate. He’s good enough to not only be a playmaker but also create his own shot. Run some actual plays to get Russ into the paint, he has more than enough stamina to run laps around the defence until they collapse. 


This is only addressing Russ. I know OKC needs a lot more work to be done but I honestly think he shouldn’t play PG anymore. Regardless of how much you love him, you can’t deny how too often he makes head scratching decisions.","Westbrook at the 2 guard **Disclaimer; this is just my opinion.

"First off, I want this to be a discussion. Please read all of this before you disagree/agree. Steven Adams weaknesses really showed this playoffs. He plays as hard as Westbrook, and is a beast in the post on Defense. Where his weaknesses begin are on the offensive end, and his ability to alter shots on the defensive end. First off, on a team where we struggle to make fts, he is a complete liability at the line. Secondly, he can not shoot the ball. Thirdly, he is not a post scorer. He scores from the post at 10.3% of his post possessions. That means, 1/10 times he touches the ball in the post, he either turns it over, passes it out, or misses. Where he gets his buckets are from pick n roll, offensive put backs, and dump off passes from the driver. 89.3% of his points scored, were off assists! In this current league, centers are either  slow but can shoot (Horford, Jokic) or athletic and great at altering shots (Drummond, Capela, DJ). On this team we really need a center that can shoot, and create his own. Adams averaged .8 blocks per game this year, ranking 33 in the NBA. He is not going to help this current team in its current state. Some drastic changes are going to have to be made, and I do not think it involves moving George or Westbrook like many people think (Not Thunder fans, mainly media/other fans). I think what we need is post scorer, that can pass out from the block and occasionally hit a mid range jumper. Jeremy Grant is also going to be a great player next year, I guarantee that. I think if we can move Adams and get a solid center and 2 guard in return, and a veteran coach that can give Westbrook a legitimate offensive scheme,  the Thunder will be a much better team.","Argument to trade Steven Adams First off, I want this to be a discussion.

"Both teams: 

-Got the playoff matchup most of the fanbase wanted. 

-Were heavily favored by the national media.

-Lost in a short series.

-Were playing against a team that had lost its starting center to season-ending injury (Boogie for NO last year, Nurkic for Portland this year).

-Had a star player who played through a nagging injury (Lillard last year, George this year).

-Were really hurt by weak three-point shooting. (Last year, Portland had no answer when NO trapped Lillard. This year, Thunder couldn’t buy a three in several games.)

-Had many people calling for the coach/Gm’s head.

-Couldn’t shake a growing reputation that they can’t win in the playoffs.

After last year, a lot of people, both in Portland and out, said that major changes had to be made. Portland didn’t. Yeah, we improved our three-point shooting and deepened the bench somewhat, but it was nothing anybody would call a Big Time Move. Even so, Portland has gone from a playoff joke to having a puncher’s chance at the conference finals, in spite of losing their 2nd most important player for the season. 

I’m not saying that Portland and OKC are the same, or that their problems are the same, or that major change is always the wrong thing to do. You know your team way better than I do. But you guys have two all-stars, a Kiwi made of stone, and a fantastic sixth man in Schröder. Surround that core with slightly better shooting and you might just have something pretty scary.

Even so, Portland has gone from a playoff joke to having a puncher’s chance at the conference finals, in spite of losing their 2nd most important player for the season. 

I’m not saying that Portland and OKC are the same, or that their problems are the same, or that major change is always the wrong thing to do. You know your team way better than I do. But you guys have two all-stars, a Kiwi made of stone, and a fantastic sixth man in Schröder. Surround that core with slightly better shooting and you might just have something pretty scary. Portland is proof that sometimes things turn around faster than you think.",19,52,Blazers fan here.

"I get it Giannis is way younger and has 8 inches on him but he's not s great shooter either.

Russ can still get to the paint at will and with spacing, it would  make his job way easier as he would only need to beat one guy in the paint.

Put shooters around him, see if we can trade Adams for a stretch 5 or let's just play small ball with Grant or Markieff(if he signs) at 5. Believe it or not, Russ is a willing passer but just likes to be the one initiating the offense and making those kick out 3's. He did it a lot for Grant and Ferg but they either missed or catch and drove instead of shooting.

"Let's look at 3 areas - staffing, trades and drafting

**Staffing**

Coach -- Billy Donovan

*Chances are that he's already on the chopping block. The media, the fans, everyone has been talking about him being on the line since basically the start of the season. 3 first round exits for this team is just unacceptable and a lot of this falls back on him. *

*Possible Replacements: Becky Hammon, Dave Joerger*

GM -- Sam Presti

*He shouldn't be gone yet. However, he's rapidly gone from one of the best GM's to a guy who can't fix glaring issues with this team. If next season is a bust he's gonna be gone I feel. *

Media Management

*This needs to be sorted. I've defended WB from the Tramel hate but the number of stories about their attitudes coming out now and the way they reacted this series is not really acceptable.*

**Drafting **

1^st^Round 2019 -- *We should be targeting Tyler Herro with everything we have. 94% FT shooter which will help a ton with our woes on that front. Also, a catch and shoot 3 guy with solid defense which is exactly what we need. Gives us a little shooting help at a low cost.*

**Trades**

Westbrook

*Not getting traded. What he needs is a coach who will be a hard ass on him. People act like he's always been the way he is and we can't expect that to change but he's proven throughout the year his ability to take a backseat to George. The problem is when George is off WB tries to take over often to little avail. If we can get other scoring options that can be fixed.*

George

*Not getting traded. Clearly injured and should be better next year. *

Adams

*Not getting traded. He's overpaid yea, but the value we'd get by trading him is minimal and on top of that early in the season he was fantastic -- scoring 16ppg on around 65% FG and averaging 10 rebounds, close to 2 steals, 1 block and was the league leader in ORB. He's clearly been injured but he's also 25 years old. He needs more versatile scoring moves, a better FT shot and better perimeter defense but he's a valuable asset.*

Grant

*Dude is very good. We should aim to develop him primarily as a 3-point scoring option with great defense. No way we trade him.*

Noel

*He's a steal right now and shouldn't be traded. We should however increase his minutes to take pressure off Adams.*

TFerg

*Not getting traded*

Everyone else should be on the trading block with targets of players like Ariza, Covington, Courtney Lee etc. 

This was a historically bad season for the majority of the team shooting wise and we've shown signs of being an outstanding team. While this sucked it is realistic for us to make an actual run at it next year when the Warriors are split up.","Let's Discuss Realistic Changes Let's look at 3 areas - staffing, trades and drafting

"Okay.. so, I know what I’m about to say might be a bit of a hot take, but here goes.

This season was one of the most up and down seasons I’ve experienced since the Thunder came to OKC in the 2000s. All year it felt like we were right on the cusp of being great. And to lose that way, away from our home stadium, be sent home by a man’s 50th point from nearly 40 ft away as the buzzer expires. That blows.

However, only one team gets to take home the only meaningful trophy each year. Do I think we could’ve even made it to the finals? No. Did I think we could easily beat Portland? Yes. But here we are now.

This leads me to my final point. Who is to say, that a shitty ending like this, doesn’t spark the return of someone great. Someone who helped build this franchise, has done it wrong in the past, but wants to come back to make everything right. I hate KD with every ounce of my soul after the way he left, but he now seems genuinely unhappy with the Warriors and is very iffy with where he wants to go next year. Maybe it’s dumb of me to even consider forgiving him, but for a championship run, I’d allow him to come back home to OKC and mend this wound.

"•Nerlens Noel one of the best backup centers for any team somehow never got enough minutes in any game all year. Not even to try it out and see how it worked , not even to give Adams a break. Certain matchups all year he would have done better but never played more. 

• Westbrook actually becoming what r/Nba thought he was all along and that’s selfish and unable to bring a team to a championship . As a player myself I can tell you from playing on weaker teams (in different sports albeit it) that when you go from having a good team, to having to carry a team like his MVP season. It’s very difficult to lose habits of trying to do it all yourself , it’s his instincts after that season and he has still been playing most the season like that apart from the middle of the season. Something he needs to completely eradicate if we wanna go to the second round next season and have a better regular season.

•Billy Donovan actually trying to coach his players. This point is also about Westbrook as Billy shouldn’t let Westbrook shoot more than George and he should never in his life shoot a pull up three and that’s down to Billy and Westbrook. In what was always gonna be the last game of the season Billy should have grew a pair of balls and made the changes that should have been made during the regular season , he should have called out Westbrook he should have tried Noel a bit more for this series as Adams didn’t do his best work but as usual he did nothing. He just lets the series and games get away from us and let’s the players build up bad habits and never calls them out for anything. 

•Whatever coach comes in next season needs to play Burton and Diallo because with our cap space we need to wish they both to turn into a decent rotation players. 

•The coach we get in has to be a coach like Pop in terms of aggressiveness because the players have a lot to answer for and need to have accountability.

"Seriously, I've been pretty annoyed by the amount of fire Donovan posts in here over the last season.

I'm sorry, you were right.

The number of fucking bonehead coaching moves this series has been utter fucking ridiculous. Why the fuck were we running Grant on Kanter on defense. Kanter was just feasting on offensive rebounds all night because Grant couldn't body him. And whenever Kanter started posting up Adams had to come play help defense anyway, opening up a shooter because *we're effectively double teaming Kanter* of all people.

Billy calling a time out with 18 seconds on the shot clock *in the start of the first quarter* as Russ has a lane to the basket. What the fuck.

Finally, why the fuck was Adams on the bench for the last 3 minutes of the game. We had a lead, and we needed Adams out there to keep.them.out of the paint. Instead were just getting slaughtered by drives.

We better have a new fucking coach at the end of this off season.","Why the fuck was Adams on the bench. Seriously, I've been pretty annoyed by the amount of fire Donovan posts in here over the last season.

"Hey Guys,

So another season ends, but I still just want to say thanks for the season and all the better times over the last 4 seasons, like 16 spurs series, Russ's whole MVP season, PG's supernova month this season, the Stache Bros being the Stache bros, anything with Russ and his family and lots of other little moments

I also want to thank you guys for all the love that you've shown me over that time. It's been one of the things that has really helped me in down times and through some personal moments of things falling apart, which I'll definitely always be grateful for. Since I started OKC basketball and you guys has been the one consistent thing for me and the community aspect has just been so good.

This isn't a definite goodbye yet, because I sure as hell want to be back next year, and being back would mean that things have gotten better, or at least I'll be in a more stable place and won't have given up on things, but I can't say with certainty that I will be at this point, and I feel like you guys deserve to know so you're not left wondering what happened if I don't get through. I have a lot of things that need sorting out personally and mentally, but I'll always love OKC, and all the things that have come with it

Love you guys,

Splash

Edit: just so we're clear I was going to put something up like this whether we got swept worse or went 16-0. This isn't about the thunder itself, or even about the exit. I'm sure as hell not a fairweather fan and none of this is referring to giving up my Thunder fandom. I'm ride or die","Thanks for everything Hey Guys,

"I'm only trying to talk to people who actually want to talk about this subject, I'm tired of being belittled for my opinions.  I'm still a Thunder fan and I will be long after Russ and PG leave!  I understand that a lot of OKC Fans think that we would be ""abandoning"" or ""turning our backs on"" Russ if we trade him.  I think that depends on the trade and if we treat our players like the Clippers did to Blake Griffin.  I'm going to propose some trade ideas and keep in mind that I would rather talk about this in the Thunder community than r/NBA. OKC has traded the 2020 and 2022 draft picks but they are lottery protected, so we will get them back if we tank.

&#x200B;

 NYC has young assets in Dennis Smith Jr., Trier, Robinson, Ntilikina, and Knox. Plus, they will have a top #3 draft pick with the best chance of landing #1.  I think that we could get most of these if we trade Russ and PG.  Or, if Kyrie and KD sign, then NYC would have to trade for the 3rd star and that could be a PG for Zion swap.

&#x200B;

The reason that PHX would make this trade is because they will be able to keep Booker.  Booker might be the shooter that PG and Russ are missing. Plus, PHX is not in the luxury tax... Anyways, PHX has my favorite trade package: Ayton, Josh Jackson, and this year's draft pick with equal chances of landing #1 as NYC.  OKC would have to take back Johnson and Warren, but that is not a big deal.  This would give OKC last year's #1 pick in Ayton, most likely a #1or2 pick from this year, and the #4 pick from 2017 Josh Jackson.  This would be a typical Presti team but Ayton actually has scoring ability and either Zion or Ja Morant would be able to score also.  Josh Jackson is the freak athlete that needs to hone his game, but he has shown flashes and had several 30pt+ games.  He will be an elite defender.

&#x200B;

The Lakers are going to be desperate this summer, but I don't think that they have the assets for both Russ and PG.  Really, I don't think that Kuzma for PG is good enough.  So, Russ for Kuzma and Ingram would work.

&#x200B;

The Clippers have SGA but we would have to take back Gallinari on his last year of his contract, not too bad but this is my least favorite trade because they only have 1 real asset for a rebuilding team.","How many Thunder fans would embrace a rebuild this summer?

"Get ready for a spicy take.

I go to 16 fucking games in other cities and see nothing but losses, for ten years, and I still hang in there.

You dipshits make it through ONE GAME on Sunday and see us lose, and prepare to discard this entire team and our MVP-caliber point guard/franchise savior all because you’ve been convinced by those numbnuts at r/nba that self-loathing is warranted.

Why have we turned our back on this team? Why is everyone acting like it’s all over? Why have we forsaken the Brodie?

Honestly, I know the prospective answers to these rhetorical questions. But I ask them aloud because they’re dumb. This team is good. And it may lose now in the playoffs, sure. Just like every single team has, and will, except for the champion. LeBron James himself couldn’t win a championship the past several years....and we’re concerned about having a “championship or bust” mentality?

I’m sorry, but I watch the NBA for entertainment, and for my team to have a shot at winning it all. If we fall short, that’s fine. It won’t always be fine, but for now, it really is. We have been spoiled by a sincerely GREAT franchise that has known lots of success, and even more spoiled by a dynamic superstar that makes our games the most entertaining product on television any given night.

I know everyone is sick of hearing this, but you guys all need to calm down. So you think Westbrook’s style of play isn’t conducive to winning, do you? News flash, the NBA is always changing. What works one season may not work the next. People change. The world changes. If you believe in this team, if you believe in the Brodie, then stay committed. Stay believing. Turning your back on them now would be foolishness.

Yes, at some point during my 16-game cold streak, i too wanted to just give up on the Thunder. I wanted to give up on seeing games I knew we would lose. It was miserable and shitty. But then, just a few nights ago, not only did we win, but we won in entertaining and dramatic fashion. I was reminded why I love this team, why I love basketball, and why I am completely fine putting all my eggs in the Russell Westbrook basket.

That may not be for everyone, sure. But I’ve seen so many on here talk all kinds of praise, only to shit all over our team when they get worried about losing one measly playoff series. Get over yourselves. There’s more to this world, and this sport, than just this 2018-2019 season, and just this series.","I can’t believe you guys. Get ready for a spicy take.

"On September 29th, 2017, Russell Westbrook signed an extension with the Oklahoma City Thunder. It was a jovial day for the fans of the team: for once, history would not repeat itself.

On October 28th, 2012, the Oklahoma City Thunder traded James Harden to the Houston Rockets. At the time, no one knew that he would quickly become one of the most dominant offensive players in the history of the National Basketball Association. Yet, when we did realize, we remained at ease. We still held two stars whose luster shone as bright as the one that we had discarded.

How little we knew.

On July 5th, 2016, Kevin Durant signed with the Golden State Warriors. A proverbial shock wave rolled through the league, yet none felt it more than we Thunder fans. Another star had slipped through our fingers, and this one's shine was undeniable. We were left with only a single star, would it leave us, too?

So we now return to September 29th, 2017. This time, we were not abandoned. This time, we would appreciate the light of the star that remained. We would cling to it with all our might and make that singular light our own. We would cling to it and try to forget how bright the world once was.

And in that we found satisfaction.

This is what we wanted.

For a time.

What we failed to realize is that rather than learn from our mistakes, we had been consumed by them instead.

We cling to a dying star, the fear of loss far outweighing our ambition.

Yet as the light within us dims, the light of those around us shine brighter. In the East and in the West, that radiance is practically blinding. We become aware how little we really hold in our hands.

This is what we wanted?","This is what we wanted. On September 29th, 2017, Russell Westbrook signed an extension with the Oklahoma City Thunder. It was a jovial day for the fans of the team: for once, history would not repeat itself.

On October 28th, 2012, the Oklahoma City Thunder traded James Harden to the Houston Rockets. At the time, no one knew that he would quickly become one of the most dominant offensive players in the history of the National Basketball Association. Yet, when we did realize, we remained at ease. We still held two stars whose luster shone as bright as the one that we had discarded.

"Blake Griffin has returned to prime form for the Pistons this year while shooting significantly higher percentages from three. On the season he averaged 24.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 5.4 assists while shooting 46.2% from the field and 36.2% from three. He also played 75 games this year, which was the most since 2013-14. However as he is 30 his trade value is basically at an all time high which will only decrease over time.

As a Kiwi I love Steven Adams and what he brings to the Thunder but he doesn’t bring enough offensive versatility to the table, being mostly a PnR/post-up center. I feel like Blake offers a lot more on the offensive end, while also being more switchable on the defensive side. If we could swing a trade in the off-season which looks something like the below I’d say we do it.

Blake Griffin to the Thunder
Steven Adams to the Suns
Abel Nader, Josh Jackson, TJ Warren, draft compensation to the Pistons

This works out well for everyone as the Thunder get an all-rounded offensive scorer in Blake, the Suns get a consistent PnR to pair with Devin Booker and a mentor to DeAndre Ayton and the Pistons get some much needed wing depth (currently starting one of Bruce Brown Jr. and Luke Kennard).

Just a thought if we don’t pull through this series with the W. In the meantime let’s get ready for this Game 5 and hope the curse of 11 straight playoff losses on the road stops tomorrow.

"The loss yesterday gave me a sobering realization. 

This Thunder team has immense talent, two generational players, and pieces that on paper could win you an NBA title. 

However, why are the Thunder on the brink from being eliminated in the first round yet again?

Adaptation. That’s why. I believe the Thunder are still playing the NBA game of yesterday with highly paid big men, slashers and at times, hero ball. 

That’s why I think the Thunder haven’t gone anywhere. They haven’t adapted to the game changing. It’s like having NFL teams have a run first offense. That ain’t gonna win you jack in a pass first league. 

That’s where I think Billy Donovan has to go. He’s not a bad coach, but with this amount of talent, not getting past the first round is a disgrace. He has more than likely outstayed his welcome. It is what it is. 

Speaking of the game changing, everybody knows how beloved and good of a player Steven Adams is. His contract is a unique albatross, where he’s both overpaid yet delivering on the court. The reason he’s “overpaid” is because he was paid MAX money for a position that’s an endangered species. 

If OKC loses this series I strongly believe these two moves have to happen in order for OKC to adapt to where the game is going. Look at Portland, all they have is shooters and they are firing on all cylinders. They have a turnstile at center in Kanter but it doesn’t matter when they are scoring at a volume the Thunder can’t and haven’t adapted to. 

Kevin Durant. That name brings a lot of anger and disdain, rightfully so. However, as much at it pains me to say this and hard to comprehend but I think Thunder fans may have to come to light with this reality. 

Kevin Durant is probably coming back. 

He knows his two championship rings are hollow. He even said it himself that those championships didn’t give him the happiness he was hoping he’d find. He knows Warriors fans don’t love him the way they do Klay, Curry and Draymond. There’s no emotional connection to Golden State and  Durant. Durant became a front runner and joined the Warriors. No different than a bandwagon fan being a Warriors fan in 2015. There’s no real emotional connection, all hollow, materialistic, shallow. I think that bothers KD because he knows how beloved he was in OKC and still is for all he has done for them. 

Truthfully, the first two moves I mentioned  earlier will pave the way for Durant to come back this offseason. He has unfinished business in OKC and a way to shed this bad, negative light on him and paint him as a hero again is to come back to OKC. 

It would help the Thunder, the OKC faithful, the NBA, and himself.","Billy Donovan, Steven Adams contract, and the return of Kevin Durant The loss yesterday gave me a sobering realization.

"Russ is not a great shooter. But he is 10x the shooter Giannis is. The Bucks are able to hide Giannis weakness. It should be much easier to do so for Russ. He is a much better shooter then Giannis and a much better passer.

The roster and coaching is just horrible. Building a team of bad shooters around Westbrook is ridiculous. Donovan needs to be fired. Adams needs to be traded.

The starting line up should be Russ, George, and 3 shooters. Surround Russ with shooters then have Russ attack 1 vs 1 on a guard. He will abuse other guards in such a situation. And if they send a double team then Russ can easily kickout to an open shooter.

It is so frustrating watching this team the last 7 years. So much potential. But the lack of shooting has always killed them at the end. And I'm not blaming Russ. I'm blaming the roster for always having 1 or 2 guys in the lineup that don't have to be guarded.

Why is it so hard for you to run a fucking play? Why can't you realize they're leaving you open on purpose? Why aren't you just heading to the rim every fucking single time? And why are we refusing to put Kanter in the pick and roll?

And Paul...Holy shit he is getting away with murder right now. I'm not even that mad at his shooting but good Lord did those damn shoulders mess up your defense too? He contests shots every so often. He guesses wrong on CJ almost every time -- are we not watching individual film? The refs have been soft but he's taking like 1-2 really dumb fouls a game. 

Does this organization have any heart? Seriously. I watch the Nets and hearing about Sean Mark's going to the refs was awesome. It just shows everyone has that passion on and off the court. 

Do we have any passion at all? We're so cool and calm. Dudes are posting pictures of themselves in their outfits pregame. Like...what the fuck? Is no one mad? Billy? Russ? Sam? This cool ""stay Melo"" shit is killing us. Like other than on the basketball court, we barely have any personality...any desire?

And because of that we just play with no attention to detail. Hell, I've been high on Billy as a good playoff coach cuz he makes adjustments but where the fuck are those? You finally play Jerami at 5 in game 4??? WE WERE CALLING FOR THAT IN THE REGULAR SEASON. It's just so bizarre. 

Presti has filled this organization with people like him. Cool calm and collected and that's killing us. We need a spark as an org. We need one of those Raptor/Derozan type trades. Steve is the odd man out. 

Oh and fucking Steve. Do any of you remember that we wanted Steve to be an all star because he was playing so well. What the fuck happened to that? Everything is so under wraps. And look, I don't have any issue with Russ freezing reporters out but gahdamn can the actual team just give us any heads up about what's wrong with our favorite players? The lack of openness really sometimes makes it hard to be a fan. How are to be connected to our guys??

Yea. We just not bout it. We don't care enough. We don't pay attention to the details. We don't value every possession. We foul way too much and chuck way too much. Russ has everyone believing we can make any and every shot and just let it fly. It's killing us. We have no discipline. We have no poise. 

And that sucks because we did in December -January and we all were excited about the prospects. Then Paul's shoulders died and Russ got his athleticism back and it all went down hill.

"I remember I got lambasted for suggesting we should trade Steven Adams for Willy Cauley Stein and Buddy Hield before this year.  Funny how I bet 99% of our base would do that trade in a heartbeat now and we'd get laughed at by Sacramento.  The problem is that we have no idea how to utilize Adams, and it's wasting what little of Russ/PG prime there is left.  We seriously need to do the following this off-season:

1. Fire Donovan for someone that actually has an emotional pulse.  This has been talked about ad-nauseum, but it's at a fever pitch now.  These players do not have the necessary respect/healthy fear to play hard all the time and Donovan doesn't admonish them enough.  We need a coach these guys will at least have a healthy fear of to know there would be repurcussions for doing the same BS behavior.

2.  Trade Adams.  I love Adams. He's a top 10 center all elements considered.  The problem is that he doesn't fit our roster. He also isn't utilized properly, but he's just not mobile enough to make up for the deficiencies of our wings.  He can't close out well.  He's also our most realistic tradeable asset while remaining competitive.  We really need a number 3 scorer that can create his own shot.   If Washington was willing to take Adams Diallo and a pick for Beal, it's a done deal.  We really can just get a placeholder to set screens and grab boards.  We don't need 25 million for our 3rd best player to not be in the game at the end.  With that being said, has there been that big a defensive difference between Adams and Kanter this series?  Kanter has held his own and even blocked Westbrook a few times.  Plus he actually hits free throws.

I don't mind Schroeder for offensive punch off the bench and another creator, but wouldn't oppose trading him too.  I prefer at least one dynamo off the bench and there are worse 6th men than him.  

What I don't want to see are these weird combos like Felton Schroeder and Westbrook. That is all on Donovan.  We might as well put Burton or Nader out there instead of Felton at 2 guard - at least they give more switching power.

Everyone was hoping to play Portland after sweeping and this is exactly what I was worried about.  Overconfidence without the personnel to back it up.  They are exposing our weaknesses to a T right now.  It's time we changed this team up.","It's time...

"I come as a passionate Blazer fan, but I really wanted to share this story. I hope you enjoy reading. Because this series is different for me. 
Grab a beer, and your Sonic foam finger and come for a ride with me.

Now, I cant relate to this with almost anyone except my dad. Man, he defined Blazermania in the 70s. He was present at Finals game 5 in 77. He collected every news paper, and was obsessed with them. Then he met my mom, and priorities changed along with the team. Then Walton was gone, but his love was still there. I was born in 1983, and as you can imagine, He hated the Sam Bowie draft choice, but still loved Drexler. The blazers drafted Sabonis, and my dad constantly talked about how he is stuck there because of politics, and how its ruining the worlds chance to see the best player ever. To him this was robbing the Blazers of rings. Thats how mad it makes him. Hes calmed down about it today, but this is the world I grew up in. Just outside of Spokane WA, right in the middle of Sonics territory.

I have been a Blazer fan since I was a toddler. Growing up everyone hated the Blazers my age, and always said Payton was better than Drexler, Kemp would destroy us with his dunks... so on and so forth. Even then I didnt hate them, It was the only thing I had in common with the kids around me, so I kept it friendly but damnit, my blazers were better. I always said we just need Sabonis. They always said... Who? I gave up after a couple years. However, I never actually liked the Sonics. Who the hell can LIKE their older step brother that your whole family likes more than you? Not me, thats for damn sure. As a teenager, nothing big happened, I drifted into video games, but my dad always followed them, and kept me up to speed. Then in 99 Sabonis showed! I loved it even if we only saw the remnants of him. 99-2001 was amazing. The counter to shaq was here... but not really. My friends in highschool still liked the Sonics, and a couple of them entertained talking about it... but the general concensus was this was Sonic territory, and I was the outsider. I didnt care. I mean, I was already an outsider personality wise, so I embraced it.

There was always the chance that there would be that preseason game Sonics vs Blazers in Spokane. I remember going to one of them and I wish I knew when it was, but I relished it. It was the one game I looked forward to going to. 

As I grew up, I moved away from the Jail blazers post Sheed, and was not happy with them, I still claimed the Blazers as MY team, and most everyone just let me enjoy it, but I was never in that group as a friend or equal. I was just that OTHER family member who was different.

Then 2009 happened. The Sonics were moved to OKC. I recall watching the documentary, and it felt like my heart was ripped out. I mean... I never realized how much I hated the Sonics. I got pissed at first, but soon learned this is the nature of professional sports. I already hated watching this happen on the local news because I hated the Sonics, but there was something more, because deep down, I honestly felt like something else was missing. This left a void I couldnt explain for years.

A couple years later, I ran into an old sonic fan friend. We just talked about it for 2 hours. It became evident that I actually pitied him. I felt sorry for him in the wierdest way. It only made sense one way now. 

It was as if my step brother that I hated with a passion was killed all of the sudden, and my family was saddened, but I was numb. Numb because I know something should be there, but its just missing. Something was stolen (No hate to OKC, this is from the heart. Understand the difference. <3) and there was nothing I can do to fix it. Its like... even as a person who hated the Sonics, I felt like I went thru the 5 stages of greif in my own unique way. Its taken years for me to quantify this, but when it comes down to it I am left with one unresolved issue. Until now. 

See, as an extension of my stand towards the Sonics, I have refused to seperate OKC from that. Its not the same obviously as we arent close, and the rosters are the same, but in some deep way, I feel that I needed this series. A series to move past those demons in my past. I mean think about it from my perspective. The Blazer/OKC rivalry defined my view of the sport for my whole life.

I can relate with my old friends on a new level now that I see how it hurt them, but at least in some way Sonic Basketball exists here. 

This series in my life, is literally the culmination of everything I mentally prepared for as a youth and adult. Not that I was obsessed with it. It is more like I now get to deal with emotion that has laid dormant for decades. 
After all of this history, we finally have the playoff series I dreamed of. I dont count 1991, as I was only 8.  I dont care if you are in OKC. In my heart you will always be the Sonics franchise, and for that reason, I cant view it any other way.

Its as if my step brother wasnt dead after all. He just grew up, and the older ones in my family all died, and then he comes back, and only a few people remember the connection he and I had.
But especially me. Its wierd to say it, but no matter what happens I want this to be a full blown 7 game series, because damnit, every Sonic fan deserves at least one more chance to fire up the I-5 Rivalry one more time. The memory cuts too deep to ignore. I hope those of you that were  Sonic fans before get this too. You know as well I do, that we all needed this. Even if it took 10 years for it to happen. 
So, for now, enjoy the moment. This series is amazing and is everything I grew up dreaming for.

May the best step brother win.","35 Years in the making. The battle of the Step Brothers. I come as a passionate Blazer fan, but I really wanted to share this story. I hope you enjoy reading. Because this series is different for me.

"If there's one thing that watching sports and playing the Witcher games has taught me, it's that all misfortune comes from supernatural curses brought on by wickedness. So what I'm saying is... I'm here to confess my sin.

Two months ago (I can't find the exact date because Reddit just works that way), OKC was on a roll. At one point, we were within one game of Denver for the 2nd seed. In my excitement, I photoshopped and posted [this meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/apoznd/were_coming_for_you_denver/) on the sub, violating the prior superstition regarding Denver. When called out on my sin, instead of repenting, I declared my shitposting karma to be more important. It was the very next game when our troubles began, and we were never in contention for the 2 seed again. Clearly, therefore, the work of a powerful curse!

I have long since seen the error of my ways and have become convicted of my sin. And now, the way forward has become clear to me. For mine was not the only sin to occur that day! Rather than stamping out my evil, the mods of this sub showed mercy to me. But, just as the Lord of Israel turned his back on King Saul after he showed unwarranted mercy to King Agag of the Amalekites in 1 Samuel 15, the basketball gods have turned their backs on Oklahoma City after this unwarranted mercy was shown to me.

There is only one way to undo this curse and make right what was wrong: I must be banned from this sub. I accept my fate; I must suffer to make the season right for everyone else. Mods, do your duty. Let the curse end and the Thunder win again!","I know why we're losing... and how to fix it.

"Why do some feel like just because there isn't an A+ coach on the market right now that means Billy Donovan should stay? He's still without a doubt the worst coach in the league and has to go regardless. Literally anyone else (with some kind of an offensive system that isn't just iso'ing between the two stars) would be an improvement. I mean...it can't possibly get any worse than it is now.

We gave Billy a chance, it didn't work out, it's time to move on. All he's doing now is wasting players' primes, no sense in dragging it out AGAIN. It's not like he's going to be our legacy/respected franchise coach like a Pop, he'll be fired eventually anyway no need to waste our small title window. 

1. His offense is non existent and has been since we blew the 3-1 lead (why we lost in the first place). We rely on talent and iso. Barely any plays, no ball movement, no offball player movement. A disjointed, forced, uncoordinated, sloppy, no sets having offense. Sometimes the players look confused out there.

2. Doesn't play to player's strengths and doesn't know how to hide there weaknesses.

3. Nonchalant attitude and never seems to care or get emotional.
4. Defense is inconsistent
5. KD basically said on his burner BD sucks. I mean if running out the best player in the league doesn't warrant a firing I don't know what does.
6. No adjustments offensively or defensively.
7. Terrible timeouts and rotations.
8. Doesn't scout or gameplan for opponents/players.
9. Has no voice and players don't respect him.
10. Doesn't hold the team accountable and has contributed to a terrible culture since he took over.
11. Scorched by a ROOKIE.
12. Apparently doesn't make the team practice free throws or threes (since he insists on letting them jack em up). 
13. Doesn't encourage ""the others"" to be aggressive for example like Brad Stevens did Terry Rozier last season. BD just has them rely on WB.
14. Terrible at developing players.
15. Terrible coach IQ.
16. Never has any plays out of timeouts especially in crucial moments, they just inbound and jack up a shot. 
17. Since 2015 hasn't designed anything to help generate easy baskets when we go on scoring droughts that end up losing us the game.
18. Alvin Gentry coached better against Portland than BD has with way less.
29. Ridiculousy stupid post game comments.
20. No discipline.
21. Doesn't encourage team ball, doesn't even try to use the WHOLE TEAM. Outside of Russ/PG/Dennis he has everyone else just stand around.
22. Westbrook coaches more from the bench than BD does.


TLDR He's gotta go after this season no matter what. Any other coach 3 first round exits and a blown 3-1 lead would be fired. We dropped the ball big time not firing him and hiring Mike Bud or Casey.","For the people who say, ""but who will replace Billy?"".

"TL;DR: OKC has no choice but to keep shooting, because they're shooting exceptionally, way out of even the norm poorly (half the percentage). This results in horrible games by Russ. We should love Russ no matter what, because he saved the team from 10 years of boredom and basically being Phoenix. 

Anyone who plays Basketball understands that if a person cannot shoot, players will begin to sag off. That makes driving harder, as it becomes harder to drive past them because they have a lot of space to work with, and the paint is packed. 

In the modern NBA, players must be able to shoot the three, otherwise they will get absolutely screwed. I've seen many people here say that ""OKC needs to stop shooting 3 pointers, even if they're wide open"" which is just complete BS in so many ways. If the team cannot shoot three pointers, players begin to sag off to invite them to shoot, making it harder for players like Russ and PG (who sometimes goes for the drive if he's shooting poorly) to actually go inside the paint and finish. Players like Jerami Grant are limited to spot up shooting.

The team has shot 5/33 in the first game from three and 5/28 in the second game, combining for 10/61 (16.4%!!!!!!!). Before people say this is a product of a poor roster construction, the team has shot about 33% during the regular season which means that they are HALF of the percentage in the playoffs. This isn't just ordinary 'playoff bad', this is just pure bad luck outlier bad. Sure, to an extent Presti has gone for athletic players over shooters, but it shouldn't mean a playoff team in the modern NBA shoots under 16.5% from the three point line, come on. 

So now, the paint is clogged. Russ shot it alright in game 1, so he doesn't really need to drive in and get those easy twos to get him going. However, Russ as we know sometimes doesn't feel his shot. He needs to get inside the paint. But because the team is shooting so horribly from the three point line, Portland gets to sag off and contest shots from within the paint, making it harder for players like Russ to get going especially on those bad shooting nights. Now Russ shoots horrific for Game 2, and gets widely criticised by players and hated on even by fans (which is just a new low, I don't even want to write on this), but to me it's not his fault. He is forced to rely on the jumpshot to be productive, which we all know he isn't good at. 

So my point is, I'm sick and tired of people bitching about OKC continually chucking up threes when they aren't a three point shooting team, even suggesting that they shouldn't shoot wide open threes. Sure, back when the team was shooting a meh 33%, they could choose to go for the drive or shoot because teams would give some sort of respect for OKC's 3's so it would be an option. Currently, Portland shows absolutely no respect, daring the team to shoot, giving LITTLE CHANCE TO EVEN DRIVE PROPERLY BECAUSE THE TEAM IS SHOOTING 16.4% FROM THE THREE POINT LINE. I think this is what people need to understand - if the team shoots exceptionally poorly, they HAVE to keep shooting otherwise defenses will begin to sag off harder to the point that that's their only real option left. If they shoot eh, like the team did during the regular season, then they get some semblance of respect and some drives are still open which makes players like Russ effective. 

This leads me to another argument - Billy Donovan. I don't know whether Billy D is a good coach or not, and I don't have any of my opinions swayed here because the arguments are ridiculously stupid and short sighted considering he is still a high tier coach. Timeout calls, I mean, he literally has a massive assistant supporting cast beside him, and if you think you can call a timeout better than an NBA coach then you're delusional and I can't argue with you. As for people saying 'Billy D is shit because he can't adjust to the fact that 3 pointers can't be shot, he lets the team keep chucking up shots', that's because IT'S THE ONLY SHOT THE TEAM CAN TAKE. WHAT CAN HE DO? THE TEAM AGAIN NEEDS TO SHOOT THREES AT THE VERY LEAST AT A BARELY RESPECTABLE RATE TO OPEN UP OTHER SCORING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE TEAM. IT'S THE MODERN NBA. THE TEAM KEEPS CHUCKING UP SHOTS BECAUSE THEY ARE SHOOTING EXCEPTIONALLY, UNEXPECTEDLY POORLY. 

So, this once more leads me to Sam Presti. I believe that he is truly the one who has failed to surround Russ and PG with proper shooters to make the game easy for them. He keeps drafting athletic players who can't shoot the three ball like other teams can do. This team shoots wide open threes, and can't even make them. Other teams dribble around, take a shoot while moving through the air and splash it with ease. They'd shoot it 100 times more if they could. This is the key, to me, as to why the team hasn't been performing well. Without consistent, reliable perimeter shooting, it makes it harder for poor shooter, driving in the paint players like Russ to score.

And finally, if you've actually somehow read through this post, which actually is just a rant for me, I have one last thing to say about Russ. Just like that post on the front page said, Russ has been one of the most loyal players the team has ever had. He could have ditched OKC in 2016 and forced an unstable rebuild, which can take from five to even 15 years (case in point, big markets like NY, Lakers, etc). This is made worse by the fact that OKC is small market, meaning that rebuilding will be impossible through free agency, and only by draft picks which rely on a draft lottery, not to mention the players who might be busts as well. Russ has showed the franchise a maximal amount of loyalty, and some piece of shit 'fans' would prefer him traded away to another team. The same people who will bitch about KD leaving, etc. Seriously, fuck off and get a fucking brain. Russ has saved the franchise from many years of likely to be unsuccessful tanking, showed massive loyalty, contributes and loves the people of OKC. The team could have been rocked into decades of tanking, and Russ saved OKC from this. No sports culture in OKC, no fun in bars, no ups and downs of watching the team win and lose, no cheering with your mates, NO PASSION because just like over in Phoenix, who the fuck gives a shit about a 20-62 team? You would have had to wait ten years for even the smell of playoff contention, but of course even though you react to a one game loss you prefer a decade long future of boredom. Russ saved OKC. Worse, you can't even show him some sort of love back. That's legitimately fucking ridiculous, and pathetic. I'm not even going to be mad, because likely case is that you're probably just a bandwagoner who doesn't even give a shit about the city, or the team. Or just a misguided fan who can't appreciate what being a fan of a truly bad tanking team is like. The boredom. The waiting. Have you ever thought about what it would truly feel for the next ten years to be tanking, with no excitement for your team? That's the future without Russ. Think about it.

"Either we are extremely stupid for not picking up Kanter in the buyout market because he’s good defensively now, or Billy Donovan has no clue how to exploit a player’s weakness on the defensive end despite coaching that player and watching other coaches exploit him live and in person for two years.    

This is a man who said “can’t play Kanter,” yet he watched Portland play him 34 minutes and be the MVP of the game.

Yes, Paul George is injured and can’t hit a shot due to his lack of shoulder mobility, but if we had just gotten switches onto Kanter on a regular basis we could’ve ran away with the game.

"Obviously this would have been Alex’s spot and with Andre out too Billy has to improvise.

Felton is experienced but he’s too slow and short to play at the 2 guard, and his 3 point shot is inconsistent.

"So after watching the LAL vs Utah game last night, specifically the end of the 4th, it dawned on me. Holy cow, KCP would be an absolute perfect fit for our roster at the 2 guard. The man has some serious skills on offense and we all know he’s an above average defender at worst. Most importantly, he has the ability to knock down catch and shoot 3’s as well as occasionally finding his own shot from deep.

 I also thought I remembered he will be a free agent this summer, so I looked it up and indeed he is. Does anybody have an estimate on his market value next year? Does the Thunder have any chance of clearing enough cap space to sign him?

#How do we get the 5 seed?
##Jazz lose the rest of their games

* If the Jazz win a game they clinch a playoff seed no lower than 5.

* The Lakers can make the post-season race interesting down the stretch by helping the Thunder out by stealing a win against the Jazz

##The Clippers go 1-1. 

* If the Clippers pick up a loss to the Warriors, then Thunder avoid having to deal with tie breakers if they win out.

##Thunder win out

* The fellas need to go 3 - 0 with a key win over the Rockets. It starts with handling business against the T'wolves first. There is still a chance that the Bucks rest their starters now that they've clinched the 1 seed.","Thunder Playoff Picture: In the hunt for the 5 seed ##As we head into the post-season, I thought it would be useful to have a thread where some of the information is readily available for people to play around with their own scenarios

#How do we get the 5 seed?
##Jazz lose the rest of their games

* If the Jazz win a game they clinch a playoff seed no lower than 5.

* The Lakers can make the post-season race interesting down the stretch by helping the Thunder out by stealing a win against the Jazz

##The Clippers go 1-1. 

* If the Clippers pick up a loss to the Warriors, then Thunder avoid having to deal with tie breakers if they win out.

##Thunder win out

* The fellas need to go 3 - 0 with a key win over the Rockets. It starts with handling business against the T'wolves first. There is still a chance that the Bucks rest their starters now that they've clinched the 1 seed.",22,64,Thunder Playoff Picture: In the hunt for the 5 seed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/baadbn/thunder_playoff_picture_in_the_hunt_for_the_5_seed/
"OKC has the best chance in the west to beat GSW. The reasons are as follows.

1. Klay thompson of course again will defend westbrook. But this timewe have dennis schroder, so curry cannot hide anymore. And schroder will bully curry. Curry will be very exhausted defending schroder and this affects his offensive game too.

2. Demarcus Cousins is a big trouble. In the west all the centers are small except Jokic, Nurkic, Zubac, Gobert and Adams. Cousins totally owned Jokic and Nurkic is down. Zubac is inexperienced and Gobert lacks offensive games. Adams is the best matchup to Cousins.

3. Paul George is the only SF that is on the same level as KD in the west.

The ONLY concern is the bench. GSW roster is very deep: Looney livingston iguodala Bogut jerebko jordan bell. This is insane. Yes OKC has Grant and Ferguson, but other players do not play enough minutes for training in regular season. Hopefully in the next few games we tank purposely to the 8th seed, and at the same time open up more minutes to Diallo, Noel and Abdel Nader.","Purposely lose games so that we can face GSW in the first round?

"If people really expect Presti or the OKC Thunder owners to not make key changes to the roster this summer, then y'all in for a rude awakening. If not to improve the team, at the very least it's guaranteed we'll make some moves to get close to the luxury tax line or even below it if possible and that'll involve moving some major players like Adams, Schroder, Roberson, etc.

Regardless of whether we make a post-season run or not, I expect some wholesale changes this summer.

If not to improve the team, at the very least it's guaranteed we'll make some moves to get close to the luxury tax line or even below it if possible and that'll involve moving some major players like Adams, Schroder, Roberson, etc.

Regardless of whether we make a post-season run or not, I expect some wholesale changes this summer.

"Alright boys, here we go. At this point, we could be looking at facing the Rockets, Nugs, Warriors, or Blazers in the first round. Here’s how we could do each:

- BLAZERS:
Since the Spurs lost tonight, we climb into the 7th  seed. This means we’d get the Nuggets first round, but this is interesting: 
The Nuggets and blazers play each other twice in the next few days, and the Nuggets also play the Jazz to boot. If the Blazers can somehow beat the nugs twice and cover the 2 games they sit behind, AND we beat Houston, the Blazers could actually grab the 2-seed (they own the H2H against HOU), meaning we get the Blazers in round 1. We could also get them in the 3-6 if we catch the clips and the rockets fall to the 4.
This is my ideal first round opponent, as we match up well against them and swept them in the reg season.

-NUGGETS
The most likely situation however, is that we keep the current pace and best case win enough games to hold onto the 7 spot while Denver win enough games to keep the 2-seed, meaning we get the Nuggets.

-WARRIORS
If we shit the bed (again) and lose a few more times, we could fall back into the 8-seed. This isn’t outside the realm of possibility seeing as spurs have an easier remaining schedule than us. This would mean Warriors in round 1. God help us all.

-ROCKETS
There are a couple situations where we get the rockets. The clippers will take one more L tonight meaning we’re closer to them, and it’s possible we catch up to them as they still play the Jazz and Warriors. In this case we could see Houston (or the Blazers) in the 3-6 matchup. We could also get the Rockets in the 2-7 if they get the job done and the Nuggets drop a couple games.

These are extremely hard to predict, as every game for one team could influence another team’s outcome. These are loose predictions, so if there are any impossibilities/inaccuracies lmk.

"I'm honestly sick of hearing people talk about what Russ owes to the media and why he should give better answers. Wanna know why Russ hates all media? He came into the league at a young age and immediately was hit with articles about how he was drafted way too high. Then it was articles about how he's not a point guard and shouldn't play that position. Then about how he's out of control on the court. Then about how he's holding KD back. Then about how he's the reason KD left. Then about how he's stat padding triple doubles. Then about how he didn't deserve his MVP win. 

How would you deal with constant public scrutiny? This has started since he was a young kid and has continued to this day. That kinda stuff gets to you and makes you distrust the media. He doesn't want to give the media anything to write about. You can say every player gets criticized but Russ gets a disproportionate amount of criticism in the media. The emotional guy who isn't a good shooter is an easy scapegoat when explaining the shortcomings of a team that had Kevin Durant and James Harden at one point. 

Now, for the past few years as the face of the franchise, would he benefit more from just being open to the media, especially the local beat writers? That's a valid argument to have. However, he doesn't *owe* them anything. If a group of people were to keep criticizing you in front of the entire world for a decade, would you keep trying to give them more material? Hell no. Especially not to that entitled Berry Tramel who knows exactly what he's doing with his questions to Russ. 

Reporters shouldn't be the ones to confront him about his shooting or his decision making either. That's the coach's job and if Billy isn't doing that, then there's a problem.  

Be thankful to have a franchise player to root for. Some of y'all are out here calling this a dumpster franchise. REALLY? HAVE YOU SEEN THE SUNS? OR THE KNICKS? Be thankful.

"I'd say it's the rough times right now, but I really think it's gotten worse --

You guys, as fans, are ridiculously entitled. OKC has had a franchise for all of ten years.

You guys aren't as bad as Lakers/Celtics with entitlement, but I feel it's a different brand of entitlement. You feel like you should know EVERYTHING that goes on within the organization. 

That is just now how shit works, and you guys know that organizations that are loose with their information end up being bottom tier organizations. Pelicans and Lakers should be a great example. Knicks as well. Orgs that have no strategy about the way in which they release info are TRASH.

And it's like that's what ya'll want.

I'm VERY disappointed in the response to the very obvious Russ-hit piece by Berry Tramel. Like...just think about it -- would Berry drop that piece at the beginning of the year? Russ has next-questioned him for a while now...why now is there an issue?

Because Berry, and consequently you guys, feel completely entitled to know what's happening behind the scenes.

You guys think Russ is a dick to the media???

It's like you guys don't know who Russ is.

Russ is not the guy who championed himself as the MVP during his MVP run. Russ is not the guy who says he's a star. Shit I've heard Russ say he's not all that more than I hear him sing his own praises. Russ is a guy that stayed down for this franchise when it made so much sense for him to leave.

And ya'll mad he won't answer questions? Do you know why they ask questions? BECAUSE BERRY IS INFAMOUS FOR MAKING HIT PIECES LIKE THIS AND THIS IS NEXT LEVEL GENIUS BY BERRY.

But honestly. Yall know Russ is a guarded dude that protects his family and teammates. You've seen him cut off reporters when they try to ask guiding questions about his team. Russ the classiest dude here and ya'll are mad because YOU DON'T LIKE THE WAY HE ANSWERS QUESTIONS?

En-fucking-titled.

Ten year old team that you think should be in championship contention every year? En-fucking-titled. It's a new fucking organization trying to figure it out.

And it's not just that it's only 10 or 11 years old. THIS SEASON essentially marks a new era for OKC...the dynamic duo of PG and Russ...you got to get accustomed to that, guys. Playing basketball is easy. Building an organization is tough. And being selective with your information is important (and it's really sad that I have to tell this to adults).

You guys think Russ or the team have to prove something to you when in reality, we as fans need to be proving to them how ride or die we are. Because ownership could be peaking into what a lottery team looks like (and that may be a real thing in the future) wherein the org has to learn how to manuever that. And the org will need your support or it's going right back to Seafuckingattle. 

I am not from OKC. I know this is huge for you guys but good Lord. And like I said, it's a different kind of entitlement than Lakers/Celtics -- those guys just think they should have everything handed to them including FAs and half of them don't know basketball. 

Ya'll aren't like that. Ya'll just probably feel so close to the team (OKC is a small town feel) and you want more. But just...no...understand this is a NEW ORGANIZATION. Like...you are not entitled to know what's going on.

Trust me. I'd love to know. But what am *EYE* doing with that info??? That's my thing...you guys wanna know so much to just argue more and say more dumb shit. It's like you guys don't know Russ is already one of the players people are most split on. 

And you want to invite more bullshit in just so you and Berry can get some hot takes off on Twitter? I wouldn't say shit to you either.

All I'm saying is, you guys are really nice knowledgable, you aren't dicks to other fanbases and that's great.

"Probably nobody loves Billy more than I do here, am a lifelong Florida Gator (all my family members attended UF, my oldest daughter was born when UF won the 2nd title in the B2B). I followed Billy almost his entire coaching career (not Marshall though). His coaching philosophy just will not work for the NBA, I would argue probably not even today's NCAA anymore.

Billy's coaching philosophy:

(1) Not calling timeout when the tide turns, let players figure it out by themselves. This works semi-well in College, because it is basically a learning opportunity for players. It will backfire in pro sports, since the other team will have momentum and can easily bury the game.

(2) Rely on blue-collar players. Billy rarely recruited high profile 1-n-done player at UF, Bradley Beal was the only player I remember after 2000. In Billy's team, there is no ""star"" or ""ball-hog type"" of players. Again this works well in College, since he will get a consistent feed of mid-level players that are going to stay 3-4 years.

(3) Of course, many of his philosophy won't work very well with Russ, or KD. He is a very humble guy and not outspoken, which is great in person, but you need to be more aggressive especially when coach supernova star players.

(4) For some reasons, he just can't win closed games. I don't have the statistics, the only time in my memory that he can consistently close out games was with Parsons. Other than that, we usually just automatically counted a lose when it was close at the last second.

(5) On the other hand, because his teams were usually filled with blue-collar players, his game often time collapsed when nobody can take lead. Combining this with his inability to win close out game, he pretty much can only win games that his teams established a huge early margin.

(6) He don't know how to efficiently use true big centers. His game plan often revolves around point guard to forward. Most of his center players are basically offensive rebound and 2nd chance machine. This does not work very well if the other team has a power/tall center.

(7) Ironically, he also doesn't know how to use shooters and spacing floor. It is fine in the old NCAA and pre-2010 NBA, definitely not now. He doesn't need to worry that here in OKC, since we don't have true shooter anyway.

So as much as I am a big fan of Billy since he brought numerous success to my beloved UF program, ran into him a couple of times in Gainesville, Atlanta, Dallas, and OKC. He has to let go, whether by the end of this season or next, otherwise we are wasting prime Russ and PG.","As much as I love Billy Donovan, he got go Probably nobody loves Billy more than I do here, am a lifelong Florida Gator (all my family members attended UF, my oldest daughter was born when UF won the 2nd title in the B2B). I followed Billy almost his entire coaching career (not Marshall though). His coaching philosophy just will not work for the NBA, I would argue probably not even today's NCAA anymore.

Billy's coaching philosophy:

(1) Not calling timeout when the tide turns, let players figure it out by themselves. This works semi-well in College, because it is basically a learning opportunity for players. It will backfire in pro sports, since the other team will have momentum and can easily bury the game.

(2) Rely on blue-collar players. Billy rarely recruited high profile 1-n-done player at UF, Bradley Beal was the only player I remember after 2000. In Billy's team, there is no ""star"" or ""ball-hog type"" of players. Again this works well in College, since he will get a consistent feed of mid-level players that are going to stay 3-4 years.

(3) Of course, many of his philosophy won't work very well with Russ, or KD. He is a very humble guy and not outspoken, which is great in person, but you need to be more aggressive especially when coach supernova star players.

(4) For some reasons, he just can't win closed games. I don't have the statistics, the only time in my memory that he can consistently close out games was with Parsons. Other than that, we usually just automatically counted a lose when it was close at the last second.

(5) On the other hand, because his teams were usually filled with blue-collar players, his game often time collapsed when nobody can take lead. Combining this with his inability to win close out game, he pretty much can only win games that his teams established a huge early margin.

(6) He don't know how to efficiently use true big centers. His game plan often revolves around point guard to forward. Most of his center players are basically offensive rebound and 2nd chance machine. This does not work very well if the other team has a power/tall center.

(7) Ironically, he also doesn't know how to use shooters and spacing floor. It is fine in the old NCAA and pre-2010 NBA, definitely not now. He doesn't need to worry that here in OKC, since we don't have true shooter anyway.

"If we play a close series with GS and maybe win a game(seems unlikely now but possible), we will not get ridiculed that much.

"OKC has the highest payroll going into the summer at $146,822,878.  That leaves out free agency signings unless some big moves are made.  That is what I wanted to talk about.  My favorite player is Steven Adams, but for the sake of the team, I would be willing to trade him to acquire the RIGHT player.  So, lets jump into it. 

&#x200B;

 I'm not too savvy with NBA salary rules.  I tried to look at the salary cap rules and it's like a thick book that you would need a lawyer to understand.  I don't know what the magic # is to get the salary cap to for signing a max free agent, so bare with me.  Maybe, another member on here knows and that is why we have these threads, right?

&#x200B;

I think that the 4 most movable players that will make an impact on the salary cap are Steven Adams-$25.8M, Dennis Schroder-$15.5M, Andre Roberson-$10.7M, and 2Pat-$5.7M.

&#x200B;

1) Keeping the Kiwi--- If we salary dump Roberson, Schroder, and 2Pat without taking back salary, it will bring our cap space to $114.9M.  The problem with this is that OKC would probably need to attach Hamidou Diallo to these contracts to dump them, not a popular idea. I don't think that is enough to outright sign a Max free agent.  Also, I am assuming that 2Pat opts into his contract because that is just how players do us.

&#x200B;

2) Looking for a Max salary spot--- This would include trading all 4 players and possibly Diallo too(as a sweetener).  This is the most unlikely route because I feel that Presti and BillyD are in love with Adams.  However, if they think/know that there is a max player looking to join the Thunder, then this might be the only option. Trading all 4 players for draft picks or w/o taking back salary would give us $89.1M and if we have to add Diallo to sweeten a deal, it would leave us with $87.7M.  It would be very difficult, and probably unwise, to salary dump all of these players.  I only see this happening if KD says that he wants to come back to OKC.  That would leave us with an open spot at C, but we still have Noel.  My guess would be to send Schroder to Orlando for their #13 pick and we draft BolBol.

&#x200B;

3)Russ, PG, and/or Adams restructure their contracts--- I heard about this on a podcast and I don't know how much truth there is to it.  In the podcast, they were talking about the chances of KD coming back to OKC. They mentioned that OKC players could take less money and ease some salary cap.  I have not heard much about this and I'm questioning the validity of this.  However, players take less money all the time when their contracts are bought out.

&#x200B;

4)Free-Agent takes less money--- A team can re-sign a player and go over the salary cap but cannot do it when the team is over the cap.  I see this scenario most likely happening with a player like Jimmy Butler, but still not likely.  Let's say that we do option #1 and keep Adams but trade the other 3 and we are down to $114.9M.  I'm not sure the exact # that we could spend on a free agent, but the salary cap is projected to climb to $118M next summer.  I don't know if that opens OKC up for a Max salary spot or not. Hopefully, someone that knows better will chime in.  I have a feeling that this would leave us with slightly less than a max spot.  If OKC could get a player to take a little less for one year and sign a max contract next summer.  Then, this might work.

&#x200B;

Now, we can talk about free agents that might actually want to sign with OKC.  I'm suggesting Jimmy Butler because he is always saying nice things about OKC and he would be a perfect fit.  I would embrace a KD return, but I'm not holding my breath.  Other than that, I would only expect a MLE signing with little to no trades happening.  Let's hear it, what do you think?

"Watching the Bucks last night and in general over the course of the season, the main thing that I gather about their team is that they do the basics right on a nightly basis. Thunder are a more talented team easily, but the reason we can look like world beaters on one night and incredibly mediocre on the other is that we're one of the worst teams in the league when it comes to discipline -- and our players are at fault for that. 

Russ for instance is an incredibly indisciplined defender and completely unpredictable in terms of effort he brings in on the defensive end. He ball watches like a LOT and completely loses his man, which constantly leads to breakdowns in our defense. Teams put him in the pick-n-roll and/or get his man to cut/slash and Russ just instructs Ferg/PG to switch because he doesn't prefer to chase around. A lot of times this leads to Adams getting caught out of position as well. Idk why but for some reason Russ seems completely fine with taking defensive possessions off a lot. Russ imo, as the leader of the team, has to set the tone like Giannis does for the Bucks, with regards to discipline and consistency on both ends, and he hasn't done that. 

And it's not just Russ, PG has been guilty too a lot of times of gambling for steals especially when the team is trying to cut into a deficit. Russ and PG are both guilty of trying to make home-run plays trying to make tough contested shots in key moments of the game. Sometimes they work but most time they don't because guess what -- that's exactly what they are, home-run plays. On the offensive end, we are as bad as it gets when it comes to discipline in spacing the floor. And I don't mean that just when we don't have shooters on, even when we do, we're just all over the place. Russ usually hangs around close to top of the key when PG has the ball in his hands almost like he's waiting/hoping he gets the ball back, instead of giving PG more space to work with and staying firmly on the wing himself. And we barely even see Russ ever take up the corner 3 spots. Even Schroder/Ferg are never strictly in the corner when spacing and always wander along the line which often leads to congested spacing and incorrect passes from the ball handler. How can you run an offense when the players can't even space the floor right? 

Another thing about the Bucks is that they've got really coachable players. For example, Giannis is the superstar on their team, and he's completely fine if Bud wants to take him out in certain matchups on the floor. And because he is, the rest of their players are too. If for instance, it's an ATO play with 5 seconds left to close a 1st quarter and Middleton is on the bench, he's completely fine coming on for those 5 seconds for that play. I've literally NEVER seen Russ or PG (even Adams) brought in or taken out of their regular rotations unless they're in foul trouble. 

At the end of the day, imo Bucks aren't doing anything overly special by any stretch. They're just consistent and disciplined in their effort on a nightly basis whoever they face. And this starts with Giannis because HE brings it on a nightly basis on both ends. People might not like me saying this, but the Thunder are inconsistent and indisciplined because Russell Westbrook and Paul George are inconsistent and indisciplined. It starts with the leadership because that's who the rest of the team looks up to, and Russ and PG haven't done a good job of it. There's only so much the coaches can do for this if the players simply don't do the basic stuff right. This is why, even though people say OKC are ""built"" for the playoffs, I find it really hard to trust this team. We certainly have the talent to be dangerous in the playoffs, but as long we stay the inconsistent/indisciplined team that we've been so far this season, we likely won't make it far.

"I know people are seriously going to hate me for the this post, but I feel like it needs to be talked about.  I'm new to Reddit but I have been on Twitter for a while and I got to see how fans felt about Westbrook.  After last year's playoff run, I asked a lot of people if they would be willing to trade Russ for Trae Young, but nobody thought that it would be a good idea.  Now that the year is almost over, Trae Young has made a strong case for Rookie Of the Year and he has proven himself.  Why doesn't anyone want to rebuild the OKC Thunder with a local hero that will probably fit the modern way of playing.  Trae had close to 43% 3pt during Febuary and this is just his 1st year, point guards struggle the most making the transition from NCAA because the 3pt line changed.  My point is, Trae Young is on path to be better than Steph Curry.  Why would OKC not want this???

If NYC is able to get Kyrie/KD this summer and land the draft pick, they would probably look to trade their #1 pick for a top player.  Trade PG for Zion Williamson.  It's a lot of ""ifs"", but there is a solid chance of this happening.  I think that Kyrie is finished with Boston and KD just wants people to think he is cool again.  NYC only has a 15% chance of landing Zion though.  However, I truly believe that the draft selection is rigged.  So, they are not going to let the Suns win the #1 pick two years in a row.  Or Cleveland, they won the #1 pick in 2011(Kyrie), 2013(Bennett) and 2014(Wiggins).  So, I think that NYC has a much better than 15% chance of landing #1.

"Hear me out on this one. Avery is an experienced NBA mind and comes from the Spurs/Popovich tree (a Presti connection by the way). He's been the point guard on a championship team and knows what it takes to get to the big time (also made the Finals as a coach with the Mavericks). He's played the NBA game and has a teaching philosophy, which I think would click especially well with Russ. He's coached stars like Dirk and Deron Williams, so it wouldn't be intimidating for him. He likes the up-and-down transition style which also fits our personnel. 

He's a one-time Coach of the Year and has coached an All Star team before, so he has some credentials. Granted, his Alabama tenure was rough, but that's also the NCAA game. He proved plenty during his NBA tenure. I just think his fire and championship knowledge would fit this team greatly. 

If I'm Sam Presti, don't look at the Van Gundys, Kidd, or any retread assistant coaches. Bring Avery Johnson to Oklahoma City and I think our team will improve from the sidelines for sure.

"Honestly looking at the way Raptors utilize Siakam, I genuinely feel given Jerami's athleticism and ability to finish at the rim, he could be a consistent third scorer for us. He's learned to shoot the 3 consistently sure, but we need to let him drive more and playmake more. We need to throw the ball to him in the post, space the floor and allow him to go to work. Also the more his usage rises, the more he's likely to get to the free throw line, and given he's a 71% FT shooter, we can rely on him to knock it down.

We've always talked about ""what if Adams got more shots, could he be a 20-10 guy"" but I've always had doubts as to whether Adams could actually do that because he struggles with double teams and doesn't really have an off the dribble game and he's an unreliable FT shooter so in situations when he's fouled it's likely wasted possessions. On the other hand, I feel like Jerami can actually do all those things we've always wanted Adams to do. He can play on the block, finish strong at the rim, can drive off the dribble from the perimeter, knock down free throws, knock down 3s --he has the ability to consistently be a 18-20ppg 3rd scoring option for us. Going into next season as well, I feel like we need to find ways to incorporate Jerami into the offense more because he has the ability to be so much more than just a spot-up shooter or a lob guy.

I honestly believe in the playoffs it'll really come down to how much PG and Russ trust Jerami (and to an extent others as well). If Russ and PG end up taking 30-40 shots again, the outcome in the playoffs will likely will be the same as last year. I really hope given his experience in the playoffs the last 2 years, Jerami (and Ferg/Adams) is up for it this year, and we can make a strong push with all these guys not just Russ and PG.","Time to start trusting Jerami as a legit 3rd scoring weapon?

"Seeing Noel playing well was one of the more heartening elements in yesterday’s game hosting the Toronto Raptors. He contributed 9 points in 11 minutes of play, in spite of going 1-5 from the stripe. Noel shot 4-5 from the field and had a team second best plus minus of -2 behind Dennis Schroder's +0. ^(ps.) ^(It was just sad to write out these plus minus statistics)

 

Noel chose to sign with the Thunder due to the team's ""very structured team dynamic"" (@stevekylerNBA), despite better offers (money wise) from other teams such as the Lakers and Pelicans. Noel was pitched on being an important piece for a team with championship aspirations, and he probably expected significant playing time with the Thunder.  

However, Billy Donovan's continued affinity with Steven Adams has seen Adams playing 33.8 minutes a game, up from last season’s 32.7 despite the acquisition of Noel. 

**Noel has been averaging a career low 14.1 minutes per game in his fourth season in the NBA.**



**Nerlens Noel’s post All Star performance**

Nerlens Noel is one of the Thunder’s only players who have risen to the occasion post All Star Break. 
Breaking a team wide trend, his offensive rating has risen from 97.0 to 102.0, and his defensive rating has improved from 101.0 to 95.2, meaning a change in net rating from -4.0 to +6.8, a team best (quite significantly) since the break. 

Noel’s impact on the defensive end is reflected in Schroder’s own DRTG post all star, slightly improving to 103.8 from 105.0. 
*Nader’s DRTG also reflects this, going from 108.1 to 99.4

Meanwhile, while Billy Donovan’s insistence on playing Adams has taken its toll on the Kiwi. Partially a reflection of the team’s overall decline, but also of the poor management of his minutes and resulting toll on his body, Adams is averaging 11.9 pts per game, down from 14.7 pts per game pre All Star. 

&gt;Of a mostly irrelevant but interesting note, the Thunder’s 46.3% FG has fallen to 42.4% post All Star, and the Kiwi has been collecting 1.4 more offensive boards (5.9 up from 4.5). This is the hard work Steven does every single night.

It is clear that Donovan’s heavy use of Steven (and also Grant) is taking its toll, and the plus minus statistics indicate that Steven’s drop off in performance is related to Donovan’s over reliance on the bigs. This is indicated in their relatively worse plus minuses when compared to the other starters post All Star break.

* -4.0 Steven Adams
* -3.7 Jerami Grant
* -2.1 Russell Westbrook
* -0.7 Terrance Ferguson
* -0.23 PG



It’s not a coincidence that out of the Thunder’s best five line ups since all star break, four feature Nerlens Noel (Although their sample size is very limited appearing in around 2 games only for each)

In spite of all these factors, Noel’s minutes have actually decreased from pre All Star break, to 13.1 from 14.4. 

With an upcoming free agency (player option) where Noel most likely looks to be leaving the team in quest for more minutes and a nice salary bump, the least the Thunder could do would be to play Noel when they still have him around.

Thunder Up!

Edit: Weird mobile formatting issues","Nerlens Noel's exceptional performance is being squandered Seeing Noel playing well was one of the more heartening elements in yesterday’s game hosting the Toronto Raptors. He contributed 9 points in 11 minutes of play, in spite of going 1-5 from the stripe. Noel shot 4-5 from the field and had a team second best plus minus of -2 behind Dennis Schroder's +0. ^(ps.) ^(It was just sad to write out these plus minus statistics)

 

Noel chose to sign with the Thunder due to the team's ""very structured team dynamic"" (@stevekylerNBA), despite better offers (money wise) from other teams such as the Lakers and Pelicans. Noel was pitched on being an important piece for a team with championship aspirations, and he probably expected significant playing time with the Thunder.  

However, Billy Donovan's continued affinity with Steven Adams has seen Adams playing 33.8 minutes a game, up from last season’s 32.7 despite the acquisition of Noel. 

**Noel has been averaging a career low 14.1 minutes per game in his fourth season in the NBA.**



**Nerlens Noel’s post All Star performance**

Nerlens Noel is one of the Thunder’s only players who have risen to the occasion post All Star Break. 
Breaking a team wide trend, his offensive rating has risen from 97.0 to 102.0, and his defensive rating has improved from 101.0 to 95.2, meaning a change in net rating from -4.0 to +6.8, a team best (quite significantly) since the break. 

Noel’s impact on the defensive end is reflected in Schroder’s own DRTG post all star, slightly improving to 103.8 from 105.0.

"I wish the all star break hadn’t happened. It’s as if our players are all still on holiday somewhere except for Russ. And now with the Love’s patches, that’s another thing tying us down. 

Does anyone think that a reason for us playing badly at the moment is Markieff Morris? I don’t necessarily mean he’s been bad, but fitting him into our offence and defence so late in the season, with all the adjusting it takes him and the others, it might have just thrown our rhythm off. I’m not trying to blame our losses on him but defensively at least that could be an answer as to why we aren’t defending as well as we did before the break. Hopefully come playoff time the boys have got it all figured out. 

Billy needs to really help get the most effort out of this team especially on defence, as we all know we’re great in transition, and it really just looks like the team is lacking effort. Offensively we’ve been a shit show all year if I’m being honest, with PG and the easy schedule in the first half of the year bailing us out. I’ve seen people mention that perhaps our good defence in the first half of the season was due to playing easier teams often, but I think we know from playing a lot of the playoff teams early that’s not the case and the team was able to lock teams down top to bottom. Morris sliding into the rotation now and getting more game time should bolster our defence, but I worry he may need a bit more time than we can offer. As long as they can get back to the early season effort in time for the playoffs, they might not be too painful to watch. TU! ","Markieff Morris I wish the all star break hadn’t happened.

"Presti needs to take a step back and understand that this team's identity of being rooted in ""defense"" is not working in the modern NBA. We don't have the discipline to continuously close out on opposing guys.  As great as it sounds, the expectation that this team should be disruptive and elite consistently is INSANE. **To think that our ""elite defense"" can make up for our offensive deficiency is ludicrous.** Better O> Better D. (The only exception to this would be our 2015-2016 lineup, in which every role was perfectly constructed) Plus only certain players in this league like PG/Kawhi can dial in and be that consistent.  Every team rides through waves and make offensive/defensive runs, but no team is capable of completely dominating on the defensive end without having great offense to translate on the other side.
When our offense gets stagnant, when PG is fouled out, when Russ gets double teamed,....there's no one else who can ""CONSISTENTLY"" climb the team out of a ditch. ie. I don't trust Adams/Schroder/JG (presumed to be our 3rd/4th offensive option) to consistently perform at the level the team NEEDS them to perform in order to win. **Expecting PG and Russ to play hero ball in the playoffs for the rest of their contract is disheartening.**

*If this team wants to win a championship under Russ and PG's lead, we should fully reconstruct our team by next season, from top down and ""potentially"" replace* **EVERYONE except Russ/PG/JG/Burton.** *In other words, 55-60% of our current salary.*

**1) We need a coach who can man up, force this team to play motion offensive, bench players when they're rusty, and create logical lineups.** A duo of Russ/PG is all that's saving this team's sorry asses right now. The gravity that they draw for the opposing defense should elevate all other players around them to play at a higher level. But noooo. Instead, we have role players like Markieff Morris/ Nerlens Noel / Tferg consistently standing at the perimeter waiting for something to happen. It's no wonder why the only role player who seems willing to play motion offensive is Nader, who played for the Celtics, hint hint. 

**2) We need less role players.** Our bench is full of em right now and nothing productive is happening. 
 
**3) We need more iso players/shot-makers**, guys who are not hesitant to shoot, guys who can actually SPREAD THE FLOOR and hurt opposing teams who try to load up on Russ/PG.

**4) We need a competent shooting guard**, expecting Tferg to continue as SG next year would be underwhelming. Roberson is out of the picture. Someone like terry rozier as a backup wing would be nice. 

**5) Gain a center who can SPREAD the floor**, have a mid-range game, elite passing skills, create plays for other teammates fluidly. Obviously this is wishful thinking since most big men that fulfill this role are already locked in with other teams. But I believe **replacing Adams with anyone at this point would surely be a net gain because of his horrible contract.** As much of a hustler Adams is, I'd rather have a center who is much stronger in their offensive than defensive game.

"Ok, let me start this post by saying that I've followed the rule not to believe in things like this since I have played sports as a child, but something isn't sitting right.

Anyone who is a hardcore NBA fan knows that the first round of the season playoffs isn't that great for ratings. The viewership is still mostly city team fans and even the outside fan base, that doesn't watch regularly, aren't committed to watching 4-7 games of the first round. We also probably know right now that the Golden State Warriors are bringing in big bucks for the NBA spreading all the way out to the fringes of bandwagon fans and even global fans so it only makes sense for the NBA to continue to make all the money they can from them. It's also pretty well known that the OKC vs Golden State rivalry brings in viewership that wouldn't normally watch outside of the dedicated fans because it's exciting and makes for good entertainment even if you aren't a band wagon for either team.

Having said all of that I feel like (conspiracy theory warning) the NBA is doing whatever they can to get the OKC vs Golden State  matchup in the first round of the playoffs to bring in a higher viewership, outside of the regular fans, in order to cash in on it. I realize that this sounds crazy. There seems to be an extremely high amount of questionable calls and absolutely absurd officiating in recent games. So much that is almost seems obvious to the naked eye. For instance, in tonight's game vs the Raptors Paul George is hit with foul after foul and going in to the final part of the fourth quarter, right as the game is getting swayed, he's called for his 6th personal foul and leaves the game on a very questionable rebounding foul. If you have watched the NBA regularly rebounding fouls have been called fairly loosely unless it is an obvious misstep by someone. So going into OT we don't have one of our best players, who was catching fire, to finish out the game. 

Now let's fast forward a bit to the point in OT where we are down by four and on a rebound that was initially called out of bounds in favor for the Thunder goes to replay. I see the replay live. The ball was stripped from the Thunder player's hand and knocked out of bounds. There were no 50/50 touches that made it uncertain and I felt like we should have gotten the ball back, but it goes to the 'Replay Center' to make the call, where it could be argued would be the best place to make calls in favor of one team or another depending on motive, and it is overruled into the Raptor's possession. From what I understand there has to irrefutable evidence that the ball was off another player in order for the play to be overturned therefore making even a 50/50 call go in favor of the original ruling. There was absolutely NO IRREFULTABLE EVIDENCE that the ball went off any of the Thunder players. Actually it very CLEARLY was knocked out of the Thunder player's hand and out of bounds. 

I could just be blowing off some steam here after a streak of extremely tough games that have made it hard to be a Thunder fan currently, but I can also put some logic together and come to the conclusion that there may not be a full blown conspiracy that's just going to force the first round matchup, especially since the Warriors have been struggling somewhat also which would make fixing the outcome difficult to hide, but there may be some evidence that supports the idea that if a few calls here or there that are easy to hide and might help the NBA make some more money then that might just be something they are willing to do.","Can someone convince me that this doesn't sound absolutely possible, especially after tonight's game against the Raptors?

"It's easy to say fire BD but it's not as if there is some bonafide championship coach sitting around for us to hire (pls don't say hire Ty Lue). Looking at what has been different since the ASB, the main things have been:

1. Schroder has been complete trash, shooting 38% FG and low 20s 3pt FG%. We cannot play him 35 minutes a night.

2. However the other option at SG, T Ferg, has shot 27% from 3 after shooting 40% for the 20 games before the break.

3. PG has clearly been struggling with a minor injury, he has not been aggressive. His percentages are down a little (not a massive amount) but his attempts are way down.

4. Steven has obviously been getting worse as the season goes, probably getting worn out. He needs to play less minutes.

5. Defence has been bad. We were winning games early in the season despite shooting trash because we we not giving up anything on defence. I think our early season elite defence was a bit of a mirage, we had a ridiculously easy schedule to start the season and it seemed like we were elite, but in reality there are holes in our defence. Specifically, we cannot deal with stretch bigs and we foul too much. The reality is we are a good defensive team but not elite without Roberson.

The answer is definitely not to fire BD so close to the playoffs, anyone who thinks that is a good strategy or that the front office is even considering it is not being serious. That conversation will happen in the off season.

The answer is probably to fight for the best seed possible, then (ideally) allow PG and Steve to rest that last couple games of the season to be in better shape for the playoffs.","Thoughts on OKC since the All Star Break It's easy to say fire BD but it's not as if there is some bonafide championship coach sitting around for us to hire (pls don't say hire Ty Lue). Looking at what has been different since the ASB, the main things have been:

1. Schroder has been complete trash, shooting 38% FG and low 20s 3pt FG%. We cannot play him 35 minutes a night.

2. However the other option at SG, T Ferg, has shot 27% from 3 after shooting 40% for the 20 games before the break.

3. PG has clearly been struggling with a minor injury, he has not been aggressive. His percentages are down a little (not a massive amount) but his attempts are way down.

4. Steven has obviously been getting worse as the season goes, probably getting worn out. He needs to play less minutes.

5. Defence has been bad. We were winning games early in the season despite shooting trash because we we not giving up anything on defence. I think our early season elite defence was a bit of a mirage, we had a ridiculously easy schedule to start the season and it seemed like we were elite, but in reality there are holes in our defence.

"Since Billy's been here, he has a 192-125 record -- that's a 60% win percentage.

Each year Billy has been here, he's had to use his summers to quickly build a team around a completely different roster, with completely different lead guys.

His first year, he had KD+Russ, second year he had Russ only, and he had to make that plan in July, while now making Oladipo a second guy instead of a sixth man. His third year, he had to make a plan for Russ and Paul George, and then he scrapped that entire plan one day before summer camp to try to accomodate an aging star who no one knew was going to fall off *that* bad. And this summer he finally got a little consistency by creating a plan for a two-headed snake in Russ and Paul George, with the other guys taking a huge step up.

Let's talk about those other guys.

Guys like Jerami and Ferg are guys that only know Billy as a coach. The development of both of those dudes ALONE should give some of you a clue of how good a coach like Billy is. 

Jerami is fucking Serge Ibaka light and he's only been in the NBA for 4 years. Did you guys see him drop a cool almost 30/10 game lol. He's averaging 13/5. Ibaka at his best gave you 15/6. Obviously Ibaka in his prime is much better but Jerami HASN'T EVEN GOTTEN THERE YET. Jerami has improved year over year with us.

Ferg looks completely different than last year. He's a competent and awesome defender. He obviously learns a lot from Dre and Paul, but Billy trusted him A LOT last year. When we didn't get it. Billy kept Ferg in those lineups and we lit his ass on fire. But today it's paying dividends. Ferg's offense has been wack since ASB, but guess what guys?? HE'S TWENTY!! HE'S IN HIS SECOND YEAR!! As much as some think he could get worse, he could get so much better. Ferg has shown us flashes of what he can look like as that missing 3+D guy we've always wanted.

Speaking of defense, we need to give Billy some props on how he makes dudes the best defensively. Whether it's in those weird ass lineups and finding who covers what, just in recent years he's made some guys look good or better than they've been defensively:

* Dennis Shroeder is a testament to this. Look how hard he plays on defense and how he sacrifices his body with charges because he knows he's not a lock down defender. But he's found other ways to contribute defensively.

* Yes. Nerlens needs way more minutes, but Billy uses him in a really inefficient role and probably gets the best out of Nerlens in those minutes. He looks great defensively, especially now when paired with Markieff.

* Alex Abrines was a competent defender at the end of last year. I won't knock either for this year too much because obviously lots happened, but we need to give props. ALex looked good.

* And to that point, New Alex, Abdel Nader, has realled shored up his defense. He's still not great but he was much worse to start the year. That is development and we have to give Billy his props for giving him these opportunities. They matter because we're going to need Abdel to be Alex for real next year, especially if Robes isn't ready again. His role will increase big time and he will need the confidence.

I know a lot of this you can attribute to others but Billy has put a lot of dudes in precarious situations to succeed. And it may not show up this year, guys. It may not come into fruition in the form of a ring at all. But what Billy has done with this club and the way he's given Russ the keys....THAT RIGHT THERE

And this year we have one of the most connected groups we've had in a while. We have a group that passes more. We have a group that's more balanced. We get to see what the young guys can do while Russ and Paul show us. Billy has absolutely coached more X's and O's this year than I've seen -- some really good set pieces we have used. Especially in ATOs. He's been good.

Billy may not call the timeouts we want or the play the lineups or people we want. But he's a developmental player's coach, man. Billy isn't Pop. Billy isn't Brad Stevens or Coach Bud or whomever you guys like this week. Billy let's these guys figure it out and they HAVE to...because that's our style...you hear them say it all the time, 'Read and React'...we have to have the experiences to know how to deal. And it has worked out for us. In small scale developmental things and in big time game time things where Ferg/Jerami make the big play or when we fucking sweep whomever in the Finals.

I think when it's time to coach, Billy coaches. And he really coaches in the playoffs. He let's the guys figure stuff our and experience things in the regular season which is why he's not a hot head. But in the playoffs, Billy's got some great adjustments.

Guys I'm sorry having 43 wins right now while having a former MVP and current MVP candidate on your team isn't enough. I'm sorry we can't win all 82. I'm sorry it's not fun watching us play basketball any more...I barely watched that game last night. And that's why I'm not here with another optimistic speech...I got nothing there. Hold onto your butts.

But I can't let you guys bang on Billy so much. Because I was really hard on him last year and year before Really. Check my post history. But then I realized we may just be looking in the wrong direction on him. 

Does this team have the joy and comraderie they do if Brad Stevens is our coach? Doesn't seem like it now in Boston does it? You guys like Brett Brown but Philly won 50 games last year and choked in the playoffs...shit we can do that too. Is Steve Kerr this successful with Russ at the helm instead of Steph?? We don't know. Pop is cool, for sure, but I mean...we got the same record now, had a better record last year and we've bounced Pop out the playoffs before...so are we really missing out there??

Is Billy being scapegoated for bigger issues like roster construction or player performance, or is he actually to blame for the post All Star slump? 

The primary complaint I’ve read recently is in regards to his refusal to call timeouts (something I definitely have observed especially when opponents go on runs).

What is he doing (or not doing) that’s actually hurting the team? Genuinely want to know, please enlighten me

"I get that the 8th seed doesn’t sound as glamorous as the third or second. But there are a number of reasons why it would be better to be the 8th seed than a higher seed

•No Delaying the Inevitable: We’d get to play Golden State and get it over with. If we can’t beat them oh well. No use in playing filler series just to eventually get eliminated. I’d rather be judged by 12 than carried by 6

•Taking the Warriors to 6 or 7 is doable. The 2016 Thunder did, I don’t see why this one can’t

•The atmosphere would be crazy. The Warriors would be under some intense pressure not to get knocked out in the first round and we all know golden state folds under pressure

•Golden State would be facing their first real healthy opponent in a full series if everything goes well and Russ or pg don’t get hurt since the 2016 WCF

Does his size prevent him from running the offense more passively?


Could the offense change as early as this year to minimize isolation and pick and roll and move towards pace and space?

"I know you guys get tired of my optimism. We looked awful last night. I have no excuses. I'm wildly embarrassed. I thought we'd lose but it'd be a moral victory loss. Being tossed by 22 is awful. I was hoping more like a 2 or 3 possession loss. 

We've slid for sure and we're looking like we can't find our footing. We had moments earlier in season where we'd slide and then rectify it. This is starting to feel like it absolutely will not get rectified. 

I think one thing is earlier in the season, Russ wasn't shooting well so he was content to defer to Paul and the team built a rhythm based on that. Now Russ has been fine out of ASB, and now he's kind of overthinking his strategy because he can make shots lately. Last night Russ was all up in his own head. It was amazing. 

I don't think we slide out of playoffs and I don't see us sliding past 6th because you need those teams to have a great run (win 9+ of their remaining) while we only win 5 or 6 of our last 12. Possible but doubtful. Even still, we are going to be in the playoffs. I just want the days off to get rest and get there. 

OK so why am I still optimistic? 

* We've beat the Warriors before in our last two years. We've also gotten molywhopped by them. This is really no different. These guys are the defending Champs. And again. We've beat them before not just this year, but last year as well. 

* GSW had a great game plan. But they have to execute that for 7 games. You really think we aren't making an adjustment? I've said before and I'll say it again, playoff adjustments is really where Billy impresses me. Gsw didn't clog the paint they just didn't let Russ drive. If we had a day or two we could much better plan for that. I even thought we made an adjustment offensively in the second half, we just couldn't make a lot of good shots. 

* Defense was solid. With the exception of that 1st quarter where Russ died on all his screens, we looked fine defensively. Didn't give up more than 24 any other quarter. Their defense was just better. 

* will they turn it on? We fooled ourselves last year into believing they were just waiting for the playoffs then we still sucked. My guess is that still probably happens lol but we get some better games out of it. 

* I pray this suspension is a hidden gift. Yall remember when Russ went down with that ankle sprain? That's when it felt like Paul really started to get into his rhythm and Russ came back and deferred. I wonder if that can happen against this next opponent and then Russ and PG can reunite vs Toronto. 

Idk guys. That was tough.

I think one thing is earlier in the season, Russ wasn't shooting well so he was content to defer to Paul and the team built a rhythm based on that. Now Russ has been fine out of ASB, and now he's kind of overthinking his strategy because he can make shots lately. Last night Russ was all up in his own head. It was amazing. 

I don't think we slide out of playoffs and I don't see us sliding past 6th because you need those teams to have a great run (win 9+ of their remaining) while we only win 5 or 6 of our last 12. Possible but doubtful. Even still, we are going to be in the playoffs. I just want the days off to get rest and get there. 

OK so why am I still optimistic? 

* We've beat the Warriors before in our last two years. We've also gotten molywhopped by them. This is really no different. These guys are the defending Champs. And again. We've beat them before not just this year, but last year as well. 

* GSW had a great game plan. But they have to execute that for 7 games. You really think we aren't making an adjustment? I've said before and I'll say it again, playoff adjustments is really where Billy impresses me. Gsw didn't clog the paint they just didn't let Russ drive. If we had a day or two we could much better plan for that. I even thought we made an adjustment offensively in the second half, we just couldn't make a lot of good shots. 

* Defense was solid. With the exception of that 1st quarter where Russ died on all his screens, we looked fine defensively. Didn't give up more than 24 any other quarter. Their defense was just better. 

* will they turn it on? We fooled ourselves last year into believing they were just waiting for the playoffs then we still sucked. My guess is that still probably happens lol but we get some better games out of it. 

* I pray this suspension is a hidden gift. Yall remember when Russ went down with that ankle sprain? That's when it felt like Paul really started to get into his rhythm and Russ came back and deferred. I wonder if that can happen against this next opponent and then Russ and PG can reunite vs Toronto. 

Idk guys. That was tough.

"Last night was one of the lowest moments of Russ's career, and that's all the more reason why we gotta stick by him and cheer him on even harder. Russ stuck by this franchise and kept it relevant when Kevin Durant left us for dead. KD probably thought Russ was about to bail too and go to LA, but Russ stayed loyal. Ik we're in a tough spot right now, but man we would most likely be in the third year of being a lottery team atm if Russ hadn't signed that contract extension in 2016. OKC are perennial contenders because of Russ, PG stayed because of Russ. OKC wins WAY more often than loses because of Russ. We don't have the luxury of a 5-man all star team like GSW so sometimes when our superstars have bad games they get put full on blast. Curry has been awful post all star break but no one really cares, while Russ has been carrying us offensively post all star break while the whole team has struggled.

Always put things in perspective guys, Russ is our franchise player, and the main reason OKC have been consistently successful for a decade despite being a small market team. We'll get through the rut we're in right now, and Russ will carry us through it again like he's always done.

"The Warriors players are great sure but the way they play is what makes them special. They ran simple plays all night and we ran Russ/PG/Schroder iso pick-n-rolls all night. Not just tonight, we do this all season and will continue to keep doing this. Our offense only works if a player gets ""hot"", it's pretty useless otherwise cuz it's contested shots one after the another. We rely on 1 player getting hot as a means to an end to open the court for others, but if no one gets hot we're just chucking up contested shots cuz we aren't really running plays to get anybody open. If OKC is to be a championship team one day, this your turn/my turn offense has got to stop. OKC has got to buy into the direction the modern NBA is headed in, which is motion heavy offenses. Our defense (which has also got inconsistencies to it) will only take us so far, time for OKC to start focusing on changing an organization culture of iso-ball offense which has been going on for far too long.

"Please keep the trash talk and heckling civil. Marc Spears already throw out some articles.

Marc Spears last year:
>Rich Taylor, a well-known Thunder fan, left all his Durant jerseys on his downtown Oklahoma City doorstep and put a “For Sale Sign” on the lawn on July 4. Taylor also passed out T-shirts for Durant’s return that read, “KowarD,” on the front with a cupcake on the back. The former San Jose State basketball player relentlessly trash-talked with Durant and teammate Draymond Green from his seat behind the Warriors’ bench during the game Feb. 11. After Green and Taylor exchanged words, security had to calm both down. Green said Taylor called Durant the “p-word” as well a “little boy.”

>“That guy was disrespectful to us the entire night,” Green said. “Cheer. Heckle. Heckle all you want. But don’t be disrespectful. Calling guys p-words and all this stuff: ‘Get over there, little boy.’ He was disrespectful the entire night …

Recently from Spears: 

>Thunder fans have also been guilty of being disrespectful and hateful to players. Former Thunder forward Kevin Durant was called choice words during his return to Oklahoma City, and one sign put his face on a picture of a woman in a dress being held from behind by Green, his Warriors teammate. Green also said once that a Thunder fan made a racist comment to him during a game.

>Durant and Green return to Oklahoma City on national television on Saturday night. If the Thunder and the NBA truly want to curb fans from being racist, hateful and disrespectful, Westbrook speaking to fans before the Warriors game and asking them to respect their foes, including Durant, would be a strong message seen not only in the arena, but worldwide.

Rich Taylor isn't representative of us as Thunder fans and that Jazz fan doesn't represent all Jazz fans.

Don't curse at anyone. There are other ways to talk shit without being disrespectful. The last thing that the team needs is to have another distraction looming on their head and one that puts the team in a hypocritical light.

Taunt them and heckle them all you want but don't cross the line.

I know we can't get this message out to every Thunder fan but hopefully it can reach some of the fans here that are attending.","If you're going to the game Saturday... Please keep the trash talk and heckling civil. Marc Spears already throw out some articles.

"So the team unveiled their new jersey patch today and imo, it stinks. It's huge and I think it's a super corny logo 

[http://dailythunder.com/jersey-patches-are-here-twitter-reacts/](http://dailythunder.com/jersey-patches-are-here-twitter-reacts/)

&#x200B;

This leads me to a larger question... why are all the aesthetics around the Thunder so bad?  We have an excellent organization by any measure.  Great front office and player development people. The organization does a great job of making the players and their families *feel* like family and anyone who's played for the team will say the same (exc. 'Root Canal' Reggie Jackson).

&#x200B;

So *WHY can't we come up with a color scheme & jersey combo that looks good? Why does the logo not make sense from any basic graphic design principals?  Why are the arena operations so freaking corny?* 

&#x200B;

We still play 'Taking Care of Business' after wins (it makes me think of a bad 90's household cleaner commercial) and play the hook from a crappy 10 year old Black Eyed Peas song as the clock runs out. It feels like now that the Thunder have been around 10+ years and the team has proven itself to be in a sustainable market with a great fan base and a well known brand around the league they can afford a bit of... improvement from an aesthetics standpoint","New Love's jersey patch So the team unveiled their new jersey patch today and imo, it stinks.

"Blame 5 games in 8 nights, two back to backs sandwiching 1 other game. Started out this stretch with the double OT in Portland. Went 3-2 in that span, as we lost our second night of back to backs.

And it matters because we've seen what happens when we play a very disciplined and focused style of defense. That means when guys are poking the ball away to get steals rather than slapping someone elses hand sloppily. That means staying down on a pump fake rather than going up and then fouling the 3pt shooter. That means being quick enough to get to the spot to take a charge instead of being a step slow and it ends up a block.

Those things matter and that's why they had all them foul shouts. Same thing happened against the Clippers -- we were tired and fouled them crazy. And it's easier to call it that way when one team is being more aggressive than the other. We were up 19, shouldn't have lost but being stupid is one way to lose.

Additionally, I don't think this game *matters* as much as a lot of us think it does. We're in the playoffs and at this point, I think there's a bit of coasting happening (defensively for sure). Look, we can go 7-6 in our remaining games and win 49 games. we can go 8-5, to win 50. We're not in bad position here. Thunder have to play whomever because we have a lot to prove when it comes to the playoffs. We can't try to game that process because where we are now, it doesn't matter.

HPBasketball has gone on several rants about how fans make much ado about March basketball while players are 100% coasting, especially if they're already in the playoffs. He says guys don't really turn it on until end of March. I'm optimistic about that -- with Russ finding his shot and Paul looking like he's shaking off his rust and Steve at least playing every other game like a beast, I really think we'll be ok.

Our time to make noise HAS to be the playoffs. No one questions OKC as a regular season team at this point. We're going to be a 40+, probably 50+ win team for the next few years. The rhetoric is all about the first round -- we don't need to play our best basketball vs the Indiana Pacers in March. We need to stay afloat, and we are. We have shown we can stick with any team on any night. We'll be just fine.","Don't blame Billy or the refs for last night Blame 5 games in 8 nights, two back to backs sandwiching 1 other game.

They gave Chris Paul a pass because he has played well since ASW but completely ignored how well Russ has played since then and how much younger Russ is. They also ignored how injury prone CP is and just assumed Russ is on the decline and think his game won’t age well (we saw at the start of the season Russ can still contribute to winning if his scoring isn’t there). They gave lip service to how important Russ is to the franchise but then ignored this point when rating his contract. They seem to think Russ’s contract has hamstrung the franchise which is fucking ridiculous.

Here’s the thing, we have our core locked up for two more seasons after this one, so that’s two more seasons of value having Russ as our leader in win-now mode. Now after that there’s only two years left on Russ’s contract and there’s actually plenty of flexibility from that point depending on the direction Presti wants to go then. 

Russ stayed when the snake left. If Russ wasn’t on the team we wouldn’t have PG and the Thunder would be a lottery team right now. Russ’s number will be retired, and as of right now Russ is still an elite point guard.

Dunc’d On are just Russ/OKC haters. They don’t pay attention to any evidence that doesn’t support their bias. I want this team to shut them up so bad over the next few seasons.

"I’ve been thinking in what happened last night.

I’m taking the Thunder at their word about what that couple said to Russ.

Even if that’s true, does Russ need to apologize?

We live in an era where violence towards women, even the threat of violence, is ending NFL careers.

Russ is the face of the franchise.  He has a right to defend himself and his family, but he is also a leader in the public eye.

Two wrongs don’t make a right, and I think he was wrong for threatening the wife.  Even after she said that.

I thought he should have just alerted security and let them handle the issue, put the responsibility back on the Jazz organization and stadium security.

What are your thoughts?

Edit:  the common theme seems to be a responsibility on Russ to respond to the verbal attacks.

For those who have kids, or want kids in the future, how would you apply this to a situation where someone said something bad to your kid?

Does an attack necessitate an attack in kind?  I don’t really believe that.  I still think Russ handled it badly.  He should have pushed this to the Jazz organization to address.

"Let's get some quick facts on Deonte Burton:

Height: 6'5""

Weight: 245 Pounds

Wingspan: 7'0""

Age: 25

On paper, Deonte Burton looks like a prototypical wing defender that can guard 1-4.

For perspective: PJ Tucker

Height: 6'5""

Weight: 225 (when drafted)

Wingspan: 7'0"" Wingspan

Let's look at their pictures side by side

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/4owrrmvg9fl21.png

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now let's look at NBA tracking stats:

Deonte Burton hasn't played much. But  when he has played, he leads the team in Defensive FG% at 50%. He contests about 5.4 shots per 36 and 4.7 shots from 3 per 36. So this guy could be the prototypical 3 and D. For OKC, he is 3rd on contested 3s, behind Nader and Patterson. Patterson isn't in the rotation anymore so you can say 2nd.

Burton is shooting 33% from 3 for  the year. 35% on catch and shoot. He hasn't gotten any consistent playing time, but I think 33% can be suffice for a 3 and D player.

&#x200B;

Last picture for my OKC Fans. Burton is a bulldog that guards the restricted area and the 3 point line. Just look at his stats vs. Schroder and Nader. Schroder and Nader just don't have the defense to keep up.

This is a table of opponent shooting %.

# The Thunder and fouling

**1. Why the Thunder fouled more in this particular game against the Clippers**

>The Thunder fouled a lot last night, and one of the reasons they did that is because they were tired, you just played an overtime game, you’re on the second of a back to back, you’re playing a team that just rested for four days.

**2. The Thunder's specific play style lends them more to being called for fouls**

>The Thunder have made a commitment to being a dominant defensive team, and being a dominant physical team. And when you make that kind of commitment, especially when you decide that you are going to guard the paint and be as tough on anyone going to the rim as Oklahoma City will be, as in particular Jerami Grant will be, or Steven Adams will be, you’re going to foul, and you’re going to send teams to the free throw line.

# Paul George's response

**3. Perhaps George's real motivations behind his comments about the refs?**

>What Paul George is really trying to tell you and me and the NBA, is that he wants to get treated like a superstar. He wants to get treated like LeBron James and Kobe Bryant, so that when he makes a defensive play, and he does foul someone, or he touches them, “that’s just a dude playing good defence”, and he wants to get away with it, and when somebody touches him, he wants to get to the FT line, and he doesn’t feel like he is getting that star treatment, he isn’t getting the respect like he feels like he deserves.

**4. Why Paul George's comments actually make the problem worse**

>The only way that is going to change is if Paul George wins DPOY this year or wins MVP this year, then he’ll start to see that kind of that come to fruition, but right now, the more he complains, not only does he put himself in danger, and cost him money, he also puts the Thunder in danger.  
>  
>Because refs get sick of it, and the refs start looking. The refs have already started looking at Paul George as if he is a whiner, because they don’t want to hear it. They’re human, they’ve got a job to do too. Yes they screw up, but the more you’re critical of them, the more they’re going to hold it against you, the more they’re going to put him under a microscope, and not give him the benefit of the doubt, and the more that will spill over to the team, because they know how physical that the Thunder want to play.

# Free Throw Discrepancy

**5. Gee's response to the free throw discrepancy**

>If you want to talk about the discrepancy, like you’re screaming at the podcast: “What about the discrepancy in the free throws! The Clippers shot 46, the Thunder shot 26, did you watch the game?” Yes, but remember the Clips missed 15 of those free throws. So the Clips kind of suffered from Thunder disease last night in the fact that they weren’t necessarily hitting. Yeah, it made a difference, but no, it wasn’t the total difference in the game. That was Lou Williams, and the Thunder’s inability to defend him.","[Erik Gee] ""Paul George needs to shut up about the refs"" **EDIT: It seems like the general sentiment is that Locked On Thunder simply isn't a very good podcast, making this post mostly invalid.

"Winning is important, sure.
But I actually care more about game to game improvement of team play and individual play.

Right now our defense has eroded since February. This Adams hedge defense to let big man roll just doesn't work. Also Adams isn't switching hard either. I think the scheme is to have Adams stay in between and try to jump to get a deflection on the pass to the roll man or other shooter.
This is a very gimmick defense that now has been exploited.
I would much prefer OKC just switch 1-5 and let Adams just guard the point guard in ISO. If Adams can't guard, then let Noel play more.

Another negative we all know is defense is shit when Westbrook and Schroeder are together. This is obvious though. You are playing Schroeder who is weaker and undersized. How can you expect Schroeder to guard top point guards or even 6'6"" shooting guards? Same for Westbrook. Our rebounding is atrocious. Nothing has changed here. Donovan keeps putting them together.

Markieff Morris experiment still not turning out well. He hasn't played better than 2Pat. This will be key to analyze every game.

Few positives since ASB. Man Westbrook shot has looked nice. He has tried to set his feet and score his 3s with catch and shoot.

Felton is actually not too bad and similar to last year can provide relief at PG. But a 3 PG lineup is shit.

Noel is a positive also. No complaints.

We have more negatives than positives. Our team really hasn't made much adjustments. This reminds me of last year when we kept the same defense.

Oh well Donovan is probably gone if we have a first round exit due to our defense scheme not changing.","Only upside since ASB, Westbrook found his jumpshot Winning is important, sure.

"I'm not telling you not to panic, just sharing some reasons I won't panic right now

* We kinda played the right way last night. I know we lost, but I thought we generated the proper kind of shots offensively. Russ looked great. I think Steve has been more aggressive offensively. Paul was at least in the right places. 

* Our defense has sucked dog dick -- but I also felt like we got called for a lot of ticky tack fouls to start last night's game. Ferg was in foul trouble early. Jerami got some really wack shit called on him. Steve never gets the benefit of the doubt. And I think because of that it's hard to get in a defensive rhythm. we're a physical team and hopefully refs aren't calling that baby shit in the playoffs.

* Paul George has been hurt and out. The game before he sat out he had like 15 points. This game back he was obviously rusty. What was great was he took over that 4th quarter pretty well. There's no reason to worry about Paul.

* But I bet because Paul isn't himself the rest of the team is probably overthinking their role. Jerami especially looked like he was pressing last night. Russ was pressing vs Memphis. Dennis has been pressing. I think we gotta win a good game to remember who we were.

* There's maybe one favorable match-up for us in the post-season and in order to get it, we'd need to be the 1 seed. I'm sorry guys, but there's not that much difference in the seeds in terms of talent. And as a matter of fact, I'd much rather go 4/5 with Portland than 3/6 with Utah/Rockets.

* Another thing about seeding -- other teams have to win. And I hate when you guys talk strength of schedule because the Blazers like losing to dumb teams too. Rockets lose winnable games, too. That's why you shouldn't count wins before you have them. 

* And another thing, we have the tie breaker over Portland already and can secure it over the Rockets next month. 

* Speaking of SoS, it's pretty evenly matched. We're playing a lot of tough teams but winnable. We've won  almost every opponent we're playing this month already (exception of Nuggets, Pacers and Raptors [who we haven't played]).

* It's easy to panic but if we end up 3-1 or even 2-2 on this trip, I think that's a win. Because after that we have a stretch of home games and that will 100% help us get our rhythm back I think. Just gotta keep our heads above water here.

"Yes, I am in ""panic mode"" and I hope some of you can calm me down a bit.

Still, a lot of this sub just looks down to the 5th seed.
But right now, we are tied to the 5th and are just 3 (3.5) games ahead of the 7th (8th) seed with by far the toughest remaining schedule in the NBA.
Our next 3 games are @POR, @LAC (back-to-back) and @UTA. Even after that we're playing the Warriors, Pacers, Nets and Raptors twice.

The Spurs at no. 8 for example playing the Knicks, Mavs, Hawks and Bucks the next 4 games. We could be even tied to them in a week. 
I don't think that people realize how terrible this could end. Every team except the Thunder having really easy games down the stretch. We won't. 
Utah btw will play against 14 sub .500 teams out of their last 19. That's insane. I just need some hope right now because I am really concerned with the way we are playing since the all-star break. Nevertheless, TTFU!

"I haven't been in panic mode, but I do think it's odd we play this poorly without Paul. Russ is a former MVP and while he's not been playing at that level, I figure he would have tapped into it earlier than facing being down 0-5 and the 4th or 5th seed. 

I was surprised the original line-up with Morris didn't work. But he works so much better with Noel, I almost think it's worth it to just keep him there regardless. For one, because I think he and Noel just switch everything, where he and Steven don't quite understand each other's defensive tendencies enough -- there's a ton of confusion with those two on the floor.

Either way, I think the issue lies in the fact that Dennis and Russ are way too inefficient together to play together.

Now, I don't think that's a problem, actually. I think we care way too much about individual inefficiency and not enough about team inefficiency. We can afford to have semi-bad games from Dennis and Russ, when guys like Paul, Steve, Ferg, Jerami, Nerlens, Nader have efficient games. That's pretty much how we've gotten to this point.

Now Paul is nuts and defenders really have to pay attention to him. We're giving teams a break by not at least putting a floor spacer out there. A more open floor:

* creates better lanes and corner 3 opps for Jerami

* creates the spacing and gravity to get Ferg wide open 3s in rhythm

* less rebound and banging opportunities offensively for Steve -- he's strong but he gets tired to and made shots = less work

* More playmaking options for Russ

And just having Paul gives you more defensive stops that ignite the team and get those easy transition points. 

Having Russ and Dennis on the floor is just a total waste because almost none of this can happen. Even if that means that tonight, against the *maybe good* Timberwolves, we activate Burton for the bench unit, we just cannot afford to be this inefficient. 

Nader provides spacing at the very least. I also think Felton works because Felton can hit a 3. But it needs to be someone that's respectably hitting at a decent clip and able to make a decent play. That would help us so much more in this stretch if there's no Paul.","If Paul doesn't play tonight, I'd like to see Nader start I haven't been in panic mode, but I do think it's odd we play this poorly without Paul.

Mainly Erik Horne here. You can argue he's speaking facts but they do this thing where they don't actually interject any facts or stats into their take. So Erik is going on about how Russ had a horrible night and how he should not be taking those shots and how he only has that confidence because no one on the sideline will tell him not to take that shot and how ""that's not a good thing"".

I know media will be hard on players but it feels like Erik and Berry (when he's on) go on and on about Russ. And when they try to spread around the blame, they spend 2 seconds on how other people just didn't make shots (and how that could be Russ fault cuz he took all the shots). 

It's frustrating to listen to honestly and perhaps I like my more biased media (I listen to almost all thunder podcasts) and this one by far is one of the most frustrating to get through from time to time.

We won today, but it was the same trend as the last couple of games. Hopefully this does not persist in the long run.

"KD went from my favourite player, to my most hated and now I’ve just grown tired of hating him and he’s one of my favourite players again.

How would we feel about KD coming back to team up with Russ and PG? What would happen to make cap room for him? Would it be a sign and trade? Or would we ship off some players elsewhere them sign him in free agency.

If we get KD our lineup would likely be Russ-Ferg-PG-KD-some freeagent center cos we’d have to give up Adams with a bench of JG and Schroder. With that lineup we likely win the chip.

Don’t act like you don’t want him back. Tbh I think him coming to Nicks retirement ceremony will make him realise that he misses Oklahoma City and wants to come back. So please for the love of god do not boo him that night, hell maybe even start a “Come Back Kevin” chant since he will likely stay to watch the game.

"As a matter of fact there's a piece of me that would rather do a 4/5 match up vs Rockets than a 3/6 match up vs Utah. 

With the way Steve is playing, Utah is an awful match up off the strength of Gobert alone. But the thing that scares me a bit about Utah is they play a really really physical defense. And it's going to get way worse in playoffs. Plus just all the match ups that cook us. 

I'm not buying the 2018-19 Rockets. I think people really underestimate the human part of the game -- I don't care this is not the same Rockets team from last year. I'd argue this Rockets team is maybe 5- 10% than CP3s lob city Clippers thanks to James Harden mainly. And we match up much better and we will be the ones to play them physically.

We look shook as fuck in the first half without PG. they got it together in the second. I’m not saying they played perfect. But they looked so much better with their defense and at times offensive decision making. Russ passed up a number of those old school desperation threes. I get he still took a lot but when it really mattered you saw him back down and try to run a set. 0-3 sucks donkey balls but we still got the best meme game in the league. Looking forward to those.

"So after hearing what Smart said about the Celtics just not being “together” just weeks after Morris Sr said they’re not having fun, I wondered how many years Marcus Morris Sr had left on his deal and saw that he’s expiring. 

For some reason I had thought the dude was making a lot more than he is but he’s currently on $5m. 

Would he be happy to stay on that kind of money if it meant being on a fun team, that also happened to be a top team in the conference? 

I’m not sure what the optimum plan is for the offseason but consensus is that Noel will deserve more than we can offer. 

I know we don’t have cap space but could both brothers sign mid/min deals? 

I like that Marcus can play 4 and back up George at 3 and Kieff can play 4 and 5. 
A bench of Schröder, Burton, Ferg/Roberson, Marcus, Kieff is a nightmare defensively, by bench standards. especially if Burton gets accustomed to nba defence. 

I know it  probably wouldn’t be everyone’s ideal offseason pickup but what do you guys think?

Edit; I just looked and if he joined us today he would be our 2nd best 3pt shooter. 39% on 5 attempts. Yep that’s Pg efficiency on Wb volume","Could we unite the Morris twins? So after hearing what Smart said about the Celtics just not being “together” just weeks after Morris Sr said they’re not having fun, I wondered how many years Marcus Morris Sr had left on his deal and saw that he’s expiring. 

For some reason I had thought the dude was making a lot more than he is but he’s currently on $5m. 

Would he be happy to stay on that kind of money if it meant being on a fun team, that also happened to be a top team in the conference? 

I’m not sure what the optimum plan is for the offseason but consensus is that Noel will deserve more than we can offer. 

I know we don’t have cap space but could both brothers sign mid/min deals? 

I like that Marcus can play 4 and back up George at 3 and Kieff can play 4 and 5. 
A bench of Schröder, Burton, Ferg/Roberson, Marcus, Kieff is a nightmare defensively, by bench standards. especially if Burton gets accustomed to nba defence. 

I know it  probably wouldn’t be everyone’s ideal offseason pickup but what do you guys think?

"Honestly coming into the season, the one player that I had the highest expectations for was Adams. I expected him to take the next step, the leap in his career. If anything, Adams has regressed. His defense is very close to being a liability to the team now with teams putting him in a pick-n-roll nearly every possession down the court, expecting him to over-help on the ball handler-- which he does, make a lob or a pass that which leads to scrambling and usually open corner 3s and layups. Offensively, where he's always been limited, he hasn't really improved at all. He started the season well scoring on post-ups, but now teams have adjusted to his only 2 go-to moves which is either the sky-hook or reverse spin layup. People ask why isn't Adams thrown the ball more in the post, and the reason is that Adams is a pretty poor passer out of the block. And when he gets double-teamed, it's almost a guaranteed turnover every single time because he doesn't have the handles to dribble the ball out of the double and make a pass. He's an incredibly poor free throw shooter. He's the 2nd worst free throw shooter in the league after Hassan Whiteside. 

And I'm tired of the excuses being made for him. If he's injured, it's his job to let the team know he's not performing at optimal levels and needs a break. We have serviceable bigs in Grant, Noel, and Morris that can carry a load, he's definitely not required to play 34 mins a game. If the team's defensive scheme is leading to Adams getting exposed on coverages, then Adams has to be smart enough to make in-game adjustments -- like you don't have to double team a Lonzo Ball or a Ricky Rubio in the lane every single time; these guys aren't going to take mid-range shots and if they do, you let them take it. It's a lower percentage shot to a Gobert dunk or a Zubac layup (inferring from games this year).

Coming into the season, I expected Adams to become a solid third option for this team, someone that can be relied on on both ends of the floor. At this point, I'm not sure he can be relied on either ends of the floor. Adams is making 24 million this season. He makes 26 million the next season and 28 million the season after. In my honest opinion, his offensive rebounding is the only real elite skill he brings to the table, and that is not worth all that money -- especially a team in luxury tax hole like OKC is in right now. I love Adams the person, and I think he represents OKC as an organization perfectly, but as far as basketball ability goes, he's pretty limited and I'm not sure where the growth in his game next is coming from.

I get that everyone loves Adams and he's obviously a genuinely nice guy, but imo it's time to start holding him accountable for his basketball because when we gave him that 100M/4year contract, we trusted him to be the guy that can be relied upon to deliver night in night out, and so far he's failed to live up to it.

He’s been so much better this month, especially these last 3 games. He’s definitely returned to his normal self and I could see him going on a huge run finishing the season at 25/11/11 on 44%FG. 

Also one more thing, his shot and shot selection today and yesterday looked a lot different. It was so much smoother and he was only taking catch and shoot 3s.

"I'm fed up with **nearly every** single NBA announcer rambling about how *terribly* Russ is shooting this year.

Fans of Russ typically argue back with assists, assist/TO ratio, or intangibles.

Let's take the issue head-on. This chart compares FG% from different distances for assist leaders from 5 different years.

**What do you think?**

https://i.redd.it/q0vzj9qmbmh21.png

My initial thoughts:

* Russ has a very solid 2pt FG% even in this ""terrible shooting"" year (only 6% lower than Harden '15-16)
* Russ's shoots a respectable 36% from 16ft-3pt which could debunk claims that his ""legs aren't there"" or that ""he is still injured""
* Who should we compare Russ to? I think Rondo/Pierce and Westbrook/PG makes more sense than any comparison I can think of

I am a big fan of thunder since 2010 and I usually watch most of the games. I am from Europe and I used to watch them via NBA pass (which is expensive but very convenient)

The problem is that I will move to the USA for a couple years for research and I have no idea how TV channels work there (I 've been to US before and I know that it's very different from my home country) . I know that NBA pass doesn't work inside USA.

Could you please help me? Do I need cable or I can watch online? Any insight with the programs etc would be very helpful

P.S. For american sports I watch only NBA and mainly our thunder (in playoffs I watch other games too but I mainly focus to our favourite team)

"Here are a few things I saw online about what OKC needs to do to become a All-Star host.


The NBA requires the host city to have a minimum 5,500 hotel rooms; preferably 6,000 to host the game, and the league would like most of those to be within 1 to 1.25 miles of the host arena.

Oklahoma City will have close to 4,500+ hotel rooms come 2020: 

2,770 current 
__563 under construction 
1,184 planned
4,517

Restaurants in the core near the arena will need to stay open until 10 p.m.--Bricktown & Midtown could accommodate that weekend. 

The payoff for hosting an NBA All-Star Game is substantial. The game scores the host city about $60 million in visitor spending. The economic impact to the event generates about $100 million.

**In the second game against the Pelicans he had:**

* 5 points - better, still bad though

* 2-8 FG, 0-4 3FG - again, ouch

* 3 rebounds - poor for a starting power forward, although he did only play 15 mins (though this speaks to his performance)

* Again didn't close the game, we opted to go small with PG at the 4 instead

These 2 games were 2pat's chance to impress and he disappointed, now with Morris in and if we sign Burton that's another player that can play the 4 and is probably ahead of 2pat in the pecking order",10,19,"In the last games with Jerami grant out, Patrick Patterson was given a chance to show he still deserves a spot in the rotation, he disappointed",https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/aqtqm8/in_the_last_games_with_jerami_grant_out_patrick/

"He is just a good role player. People in this sub say he is All Star level but doesn't hold him accountable and gives him a light pass when he plays poorly. We don't have the same pressure and expectations of him as we do with WB, PG or any other all star on another team.

I have been saying this for a while but IMO he has the typical kiwi attitude where he doesn't want to stand out and wants to facilitate scoring for others. Sometimes we need him to drive to the basket and create offense on his own especially when the team isn't shooting well. The epitome of this mindset is when he gave up a [wide open dunk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLoYKYudBk4&t=0m45s) for a kick out. The first thing he always thinks of is to pass the ball instead of thinking of a way he can get the basket himself. I also wish he would spin and drive to the rim from outside the paint instead of always going for that hand off to PG or Russ. He has shown glimpses of this before https://streamable.com/5dm5n.

He also needs to slip off his man in offense when WB or whoever is driving to the rim instead of standing there just being the person to pull his man to ""try"" and create space. Too often than not, WB drives and he runs into bodies with nowhere to go and Adams is still behind his man or too close for WB to get a clean pass to him.

Also of note is his hands. When he is shooting well he has a nice flick, when he doesn't, his hands are stiff and he almost pushes with his palms. I get that he is tired (he plays the most minutes of anyone on the team) and may be injured but the stuffiness on offense has always been there for years.

This could also be why some easy for him at least layups end up short. Something else I've read in here is that it could be a mental thing after the ankle injury when he landed on AD's foot, that could also explain why he doesn't drive to the basket like he did before (not saying that it's a 100% bad thing).

I'm hopeful that the Brodie will figure it out and will deliver when we need him, his shot starts falling and we're more dangerous as a team.","About Westbrook's shooting.

"I know winning fixes all problems, but it warms my heart to see this team have so much fun. I haven't seen this joy since GSW in the previous seasons. 

* Paul George is smiling after every basket. He's way more expressive with his celebrations. My FAVORITE moment was in the previous Blazers game, where he passed the ball to Burton at the end of the first quarter and Burton hit the 3 at the buzzer. PG actually walked past the ENTIRE sideline and gave nearly all the courside fans a high 5. It gives me so much joy to see how much fun he's having. It really looks like he feels he made the absolute best decision to stay in OKC.
* Terrence Ferguson looks as confident as he's ever been. This guy just let's it fly at any time. The whole team is encouraging him to shoot more, even after bad misses. And you can see he's enjoying the heck out of it with his 3pt celebrations.
* Dennis Schröder has finally been freed from the tank in Atlanta, and this dude is straight out balling. I was a bit scared he would be a Dion Waters 2.0 where he'd be pissed about every ball he would not get. But this guy completely accepted his role as a backup point guard, and is excelling at it. He's even closing out games sometimes, so he knows we value him as much as any of our starters.
* And Felton's statement about the chemistry of the team is just the cherry on top. This dude legitemately has basically been DNP'd all season, comes in the game, gives tremendous energy and good scoring off the bench. No bitchy attitude. Yes, he would like to play more. But he knows he's part of something special. I think after this game he and the Thunder realise how important it is for him to stay ready for the moment when he is needed.

"The Thunder are just two games out from the 2nd seed *in the West* behind the write-off Warriors team, and 8 games ahead of the next best team, including the Rockets. While the 1st seed Bucks are just two games ahead of Toronto.

We still havnt even reached the All-star break yet. There’s still a long way to go until the end of the regular season.

With Chris Paul back in the line up, and still being about half way into the season, there’s a big chance that both James Harden won’t be able to sustain this kind of play (with criminal level efficiency, btw) and the Rockets are pushed back to the 6th or even 7th seed. If either one of these things happen, there is no way that Harden will win MVP.

At the same time, all that needs to happen to the Bucks is for them to be overtaken by the Raptors and fall to the 2nd seed (in the East), thus taking away from the “best record in the NBA” narrative supporting Giannis’ case.

The Thunder are not falling past the third seed. And they are close to reaching the second. As long as PG keeps it up, I honestly don’t see any reason why he won’t be the front runner before the end of the season.

What are your guys thoughts?","So far the only arguments against PG for MVP are the bucks seed positioning and Hardens scoring streak. But...

"As we all have seen, Enes is looking to be bought out of New York. I believe that he is going to come to OKC by choice, and take a paycut along with it. We all know the obvious reasons WHY Enes would come here; he's a fan favorite, he loves Russell Westbrook as if he were a god, Steven Adams is his brother, etc. But among all of this giddiness of the return of our favorite 7 foot tall Freddie Mercury is a lot of uneasiness on if he would actually help the Thunder. I have some reasons why he would.

1. As much as we all hate to believe it, Nerlens Noel will get a bigger paycheck than we can give him. The man came here to prove that he is worth more than what people were offering him. He has shown that. Enes would be our insurance that we have a solid backup center next year, and won't have to pull another guy from the G league just so we aren't murdered on the boards.
2. Enes is one of the best rebounders in the league. OKC was the best rebounding team in NBA HISTORY with Enes backing up Steven as our core big men. Patrick Patterson cannot get a rebound to save his life. This would be a MASSIVE improvement. It has been said before by many people; looking at who won the rebounds in a game, is typically the winner of the game. This is a huge part of OKC's continued success.
3. Enes, while not a good defender, can actually guard bigs at an an average level. The problem is in pick and rolls against really good teams with great backcourts. Our switch everything defense doesn't work with Enes in the starting lineup.  What does work, however, is Enes feasting on opposing teams benches. I don't know if you guys remember, but Enes is a walking double double. And besides schroder, we don't have a whole ton of bench scoring.
4. CHEMISTRY. This is the difference between a good team and a championship team. Guys who love each other and love playing together will play in the best interest of each other, and that is winning. If anything, Enes plays an amazing Kendrick Perkins role by making the Thunder a fun team to play on. 

Obviously, a lot of stars have to align for this to work. We need Enes to want to play here for a small amount of money, and we need him to accept a smaller role at least for this season until Nerlens most likely leaves. I understand we love to quote ""Can't play Kanter"" but the guy can truly ball in a solid system, and I think ours is one that can empower his strengths and hide his weaknesses. I'm prepared to get a lot of flak from this post, but I believe that Enes can actually make this team much better, and a tool to use against certain teams that make the Thunder that much more unbeatable.","The Benefits of Enes Returning - A 'Stache brothers' reunion As we all have seen, Enes is looking to be bought out of New York. I believe that he is going to come to OKC by choice, and take a paycut along with it. We all know the obvious reasons WHY Enes would come here; he's a fan favorite, he loves Russell Westbrook as if he were a god, Steven Adams is his brother, etc. But among all of this giddiness of the return of our favorite 7 foot tall Freddie Mercury is a lot of uneasiness on if he would actually help the Thunder. I have some reasons why he would.

1. As much as we all hate to believe it, Nerlens Noel will get a bigger paycheck than we can give him. The man came here to prove that he is worth more than what people were offering him. He has shown that. Enes would be our insurance that we have a solid backup center next year, and won't have to pull another guy from the G league just so we aren't murdered on the boards.
2. Enes is one of the best rebounders in the league. OKC was the best rebounding team in NBA HISTORY with Enes backing up Steven as our core big men. Patrick Patterson cannot get a rebound to save his life. This would be a MASSIVE improvement. It has been said before by many people; looking at who won the rebounds in a game, is typically the winner of the game. This is a huge part of OKC's continued success.

Everyone has been riding Wayne on here for the past year. My only thing is he wasn't even in the Heats rotation! I know everyone sees him as a big factor in our offense if he gets here. But there's no way he should be getting minutes over Ferguson, and I'd even say taking them away from Diallo, as he's a special kind of player with tons of potential. He's 37% from 3, good player. 


But it'd be very silly to make him a buy-out priority over other potential guys like Wes Matthews, seeing as how Ferguson has become a MAJOR threat from 3, and the guard positions are basically locked up. If he wants to play for us great, if not so be it we have so many young-talented guards. It's almost funny how much we overlook how good they are, and how good they could be over a 37% 3pt shooter. I mean for Christ's sake we still haven't even signed Deonte Burton.


I get Ellington is a playoff piece, but he definitely shouldn't be our top priority.

In the same stretch, OKC is **3rd** in left corner 3s made behind Utah and Miami, at **2.1** made per game, despite being **11th** in their number of attempted left corner 3s. (For context, Utah and Miami are 1st and 2nd in attempts). They are thus shooting **50%** from the left corner.

"Losing to Boston ain't a bad thing and one of those things you have to take on the chin and move on. I think a very vocal minority are overreacting about this game but it feels most everyone with some sense is happy we only lost by 4, and we had a legit chance, and then worstbrook happened. That's neither here nor there.

I know someone posted a video but I want to talk schematics with you guys! And how our team defense is really fucking good, but obviously is more effective based on the opponent. What does that mean?

Our PnR defense is to blitz. So the guard and the center (whomever is in the pick and roll) are basically trying to contain the ballhandler. This is awesome and it works against *most* opponents because most can't effectively pass out of it (or make the simple pass that frees them to reset).Why?

This blitz works because 9 times out of 10 the guard can't make the pass to the open guy. Russ is taller than usually everyone he guards and Steven is huge. Or it will be Steve and Paul. Or Steven and Jerami. We blitz because our personnel makes it tough with length and size. When we blitz, we basically only leave the weakside corner open which is a cross court pass. Most guards/ballhanders can't make that -- a few top tier ones can. 

So if they throw that cross court pass, someone has to rotate over to the corner where someone is usually open.

Now the next thing the Thunder do is scramble. We take pride in this. The idea is basically grab a guy when we get to rotating. Be aware and step up. Now, our personnel is good at this too, because pretty much everyone on this team is fast. This scramble situation really is good because again, most teams arent going to be quicker than us and are going to have a hard time dodging by our length.

So supposed the ballhandler says fuck the weakside corner pass, I'ma throw it to my roll man. This is another thing that blows up our scheme is when the roll man actually rolls. Watch us play teams like the Suns or something with young kids. The roller always tries to stick around and screen Russ. That just either allows us to switch (steve holds his own) or just reset.

When the guy continues to roll, like Celtics bigs last night, we have a man on the wing or in the paint who has to guard two positions (cuz russ and steve are blitzing). Again, this normally is ok for our personnel because most times the center on most teams ain't that good (who are the premier centers? there aren't a ton...we wont see them nightly), but again think of like Ayton or Javale, or or something. We're going to rotate over with Jerami who can defend. We've even seen Terrance stop a guy in his tracks. And look -- we're not going to stop them every time. We just want to make it a really uncomfy thing for them.

But again, when we're facing real talent with a center that can shoot, pass, post up. It's going to be tough. Some guys are going to be big enough to just go over any defender. Some guys will be quick enough to get there before the defender. Some guys will have the range that allows them to pick and pop rather than roll. Some of them will have the passing skills that allow them to make another pass. And that all messes up the blitz and/or scramble. Again...think of how many centers in the league at all levels can do that. Not a lot.

Ok so here's the thing I want you to take away from this

1. Based on our defensive scheme, better players are going to handle it a bit differently. This is still the best way to stop the PnR, this blitz scheme. And most teams don't do it because IT'S TIRING (which is probably why we're slipping and why I want Alex and Robes back).

2. As Billy told you, it's not the PnR defense. Against a team like the Cs, you're hopeful to slow that down. You are not stopping Kyrie and Al all night. What you can't let happen is the perimeter defense. Marcus Smart looked like Klay Thompson last night. Jaylen Brown looked like Kevin damn Durant. Can't do that. And that's typically an issue of when scrambling goes wrong -- either someone missed the rotation or we just weren't quick enough (which is possible against other quick teams, see Sacramento).

3. Steven is not a defensive liability. The bench doesn't blitz as much -- I think it depend son the opponent -- our bench can't scramble as much because they aren't that quick or capable so we do a lot of switching everything with the bench out there. So to say Noel is better defensively is a bit...wrong...they're playing two different things and doing two different things.

4. Unfortunately, it's usually Russ. If they blitz and Russ doesn't fight over a screen or through some contact, then Adams has to guard a fast guard or a big guy rolling in the paint. Of course he looks bad. But Russ has to step up. This is where we miss Dre...for his ability to stay connected and his ability to scramble.

5. Speaking of Dre, his scrambling is what we should be most concerned about. That lateral quickness will take time to return.

6. We're going to struggle against fast teams with fast players. Everyone on the Celtics has a stupid quick first step. Marcus Morris cooked PG. Like..that team is stacked and we're still only one win away from them.

It's why we suck against the Kings. Fast teams that can shoot the 3 are going to kill us. Now I know you think that's the Warriors, but I think our personnel is much better and I only think Steph and KD have the first step that's crazy. DMC ain't outrunning Steve. Terrance has already given Klay hell, so has PG. Russ has size on Steph. It's still a better match up PLUS their bench is no where near as stacked as the Celtics. That was ridiculous lol.

My West concerns are Denver, Blazers, Spurs -- literally everyone else but the stars are quick lol so it's weird, and Kings are my worst nightmares.","Some things to keep in mind for this 'tough stretch' -- how we play defense and what it means Losing to Boston ain't a bad thing and one of those things you have to take on the chin and move on.

"Adams has been injured for almost two months now and has been playing through the pain.   

He sat out one game but obviously that wasn’t enough of a rest for him to actually recover.   

By playing him while he’s injured, we are risking him injuring himself further and at the very least, prolonging the current injury and perhaps making it into a nagging/re-occurring injury.   

At 34 MPG, he’s second in the league in minutes played per game for centers behind Clint Capela, and the Rockets play a much slower pace.

Furthermore, Adams has looked like a shell of himself and has looked slower than a 39 year old Kendrick Perkins out there, so there’s really no reason to keep playing him while he’s injured as he is not contributing the way he does when he’s healthy.  

We need Adams fully healthy for the playoffs so I’m honestly baffled as to why our medical staff is not forcing him to take time off to rest, rehab and recover.  

They don’t have a very good track record with rushing guys back and not diagnosing injuries properly so it doesn’t surprise me that they’re dropping the ball again.   

For anyone who’s going to jump down my throat for questioning our medical staff, I was the one who called them out for rushing Roberson back too early last year and two weeks later he re-injured himself due to improper healing in his knee, and I’m concerned we could see Adams suffer a setback if not given the proper time and treatment to recover.","Steven Adams is quite clearly playing injured and it’s concerning Adams has been injured for almost two months now and has been playing through the pain.

"Great game. Not too mad about outcome as the Celts had their best offensive game of the year and we fought this game down to the last few possessions.


So let's get into those last few possessions. 


Why do we have our worst defensive net player guarding the legendary Kyrie Irving and our best guard defender on the bench?


Billy Donovan I'm looking at you.


You bring in Ferg for one play and he immediately forces a turnover on the legendary Kyrie Irving and then immediately take him out and put our worst defensive net guard back in -- and guess what??? Kyrie beats us.

On top of defense, Ferg is the better floor spacer, back door cutter, and overall hustler on the floor. I was tough on Ferg his rookie season and the beginning of this season, but it's time to have Ferg in our death lineup in crunch time.

"Eleven years in the city. Only two seasons we've missed the playoffs. We've seen stars like Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, Serge Ibaka, Kendrick Perkins, Victor Oladipo come through and play for the smallest market in the league. 

We've always been in good competitive position, and the only year we weren't (pilot season, 2016-17), Sam was putting us in position to make future splashes. There's never been an instance where we weren't in the conversation really. Even in our down years, we made the news for some reason (KD/Russ/Green future, MVP Russ, etc.). 

He gets a lot of unnecessary flack for the Harden trade, but two things were the reality of that situation: ownership wasn't going to stretch the tax and Harden wasn't willing to sacrifice as the others were. Sam realized that ownership and Harden's personal preference were against him and he made the move as instant as possible so we wouldn't have to go through a season full of drama. Same thing with KD, we didn't get anything in return but Durant also led us to believe he was sticking it out. That obviously didn't happen. It only took Sam one season to put us back into spotlight after KD's departure, whereas other organizations would have taken longer. 

He's always in aggressive position to improve our team. Our transactions don't get leaked and he's very good at drafting as we are aware. I look at Steven Adams, Jerami Grant, and Terrence Ferguson and wonder if any of those guys would have gotten valuable time anywhere else. Sam saw what was there and put it together and now all three are big contributors to our team. Those are diamonds in the rough that only Presti can see. 

We've got in my opinion the best executive in the league. We're always in good position and one of these years, it is going to payoff for a championship or two. When Paul and Russ grow old and eventually retire, I trust no one more than Sam Presti to steer us through a proper rebuild. We should be grateful to have a general manager that never puts us in compromising positions or gives us a bad reputation.
