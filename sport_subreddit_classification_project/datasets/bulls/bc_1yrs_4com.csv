"On Monday, new Bull Tomas Satoransky talked with Czech media. I translated the most important quotes. 

* Tomas Satoransky on the Bulls: **""I only learned of their big interest [in having me on the team] just yesterday. It intrigued me a lot. Chicago gave me an offer and I [immediately] had a big interest in playing for them. Then it was up to the teams to agree on a deal. I had to be up on the phone until 3 AM. When I heard the news of the trade today, I was hugely happy. I'm really looking forward to playing for the Bulls. I'm thrilled. It still hasn't sunk in my head yet that I will play for the same team as [Michael] Jordan. He was my hero and idol, so it's like a fairy tale for me right now. To play in the United Center is just unbelievable.""**

* Satoransky on the new contract and being a Bulls player: **""It gives me a big motivation to work even harder. From the beginning, we didn't want a short-term contract. Those three years, that was something we worked for to get. We're happy for that. Of course, now I have a big responsibility to get better and show even better performances. I think I'm ready for this situation. I have already talked with coach [Jim] Boylen, it was an inspiring talk. The [Bulls'] young players have a lot of potential. I don't want to say now that I will be a starting point guard, but there are signs that I could get a lot of playing time.""**

* Sato on becoming the highest-paid Czech athlete: **""I couldn't even imagine this a couple of years ago. I have a great feeling.""**

"**Year one of the rebuild**


It started with the Jimmy Butler trade to the Timberwolves. Bulls are getting back an injured Zach LaVine, an unproven Kris Dunn and an unknown draft pick in Lauri Markkanen. The following season wa unbearable to watch. As injury plagued the roster, and Fred was forced to play shoot first guards in Grant and Holiday.

&nbsp;

**Year two of the rebuild**


Gar took a risk in year two of the rebuild, by signing Chicago native Jabari Parker. After just three regular season games, the risk ended up a disaster. With Parker failing on every expectation, somebody has to take the fall. 

&nbsp;

It was Fred Hoiberg. 

&nbsp;

The rebuild has gone from bad to worst. Bulls needing stability and continuity, put associate head coach Jim Boylen to get the locker room regrouped. But it resulted to total chaos. 


With Boylen making a point about discipline and habit, a clear shot at Jabari Parker, he run the entire team to the ground like drill sergeant. Then came Bulls worst loss in franchise history. A 56 point beat down from the Boston Celtics. Then there's ""The Mutiny."" It lasted for more than a month, until Gar found an opportunity to correct his mistake...

&nbsp;

**Wiz to the rescue**


A trade getting rid of the main problem Jabari Parker, unexpectedly got the Bulls a miracle player in Otto Porter. [Joe Cowley reported, ""that these guys follow the money.""](https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bulls/bulls-talk-podcast-conversation-sun-times-reporter-joe-cowley) Jabari was the highest paid player in the team. Seeing Jabari not practicing, would make the rest of his teammates lose interest, because they're working hard for just a fraction of Jabari's money. Then came Otto Porter Jr.

&nbsp;

**Otto Porter Jr.**


OPJ came in with $7M more than Jabari Parker's salary. Every eyes was on him. But Otto didn't fail. Off the court, Joe Cowley reported that Otto showed to this younger players, the work needed to get that pay check. On the court, he was the perfect fit to Bulls starting line-up. Bulls then begun to win games. And the dark cloud that hovers on top of the team, started to disappear. Now GarPax has an idea, of what players they needed to surround the core with.

&nbsp;

**2019 off-season**


[Pax in his post draft press conference](https://www.nba.com/bulls/video/teams/bulls/2019/06/21/2655761/1561093865120-2019-draft-press-conference-final-2655761) stated about the direction, that they had ""specific ideas in mind."" They need to have the ""right guys."" And you can barely find a PG, that shoot the three this free agency.  D'Angelo Russell and Brogdon was beyond Bulls budget. Pat and Cory was paid a lot too. But Bulls still managed to land their ideal guy, thanks to the Wiz again.

&nbsp;

**Tomas Satoransky**


Sato is a 6'7 versatile player that can play three positions. Like Otto Porter Jr., he is regarded as a glue guy with multiple skill set. Tough, competitive, can drive, shoot and pass. Something you don't find in 2019 free agency for $10M per season. And yet, Wiz gifted him to the Bulls, for two second round picks and an option to swap second rounders. 

&nbsp;

**Probable end of rebuild**


What made me buy in to this ""end of rebuild"" is how both Wizard players, fit amazingly with the Bulls core. They have great versatility and skill set, that enables them to play with or without the ball in their hands.


Zach LaVine and Kris Dunn(assuming he stays a Bull going into the season) cannot play together. Both need to have the ball in their hands to be effective. But because of Sato's ability to play three positions, he can compensate playing with either Zach or KD. Pair them with Otto, who can play with any of the Bulls combination, it gives this stability in rotations. Something this team never had, after Derrick Rose went down.

&nbsp;

**Rotation**

First 6 minutes

- *Sato(6), Zach(6), Otto(6), Lauri(6), Wendell(6)*

&nbsp;



Next 4 minutes


- *Dunn(4), Sato(10), Otto(10), Thad(4), Lauri(10)*

&nbsp;



In between quarters 6 minutes


- *Dunn(10), Arci/Denzel(6), Denzel/Hutchison(6), Thad(10), Gafford(6)* 

&nbsp;


Start bringing back Zach and Wendell 4 minutes


- *Zach(10), Arci/Denzel(10), Denzel/Hutchison(10), Thad(14), Wendell(10)*

&nbsp;



Bring back the starters last 4 minutes of he half.


- *Sato(14), Zach(14), Otto(14), Lauri(14) and Wendell(14)*

&nbsp;

This just show how the new two Wiz and Thad Young, amazingly solved the puzzle on the Dunn-LaVine rotational fit. Also that Shaq Harrison/Coby White could easily take Dunn's place, if Dunn is traded before the season starts or at/before trade deadline. Without Sato and Otto, Bulls rebuild could have pushed back for two more years. The likes of Harrison Barnes, Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris would have blown out Bulls cap space until 2023. Or Bulls signing middle tier wings to start with middle tier PG, without an assurance to progress to a playoff spot. 


Wiz offered fit and cap flexibility, on top of quality players, who can get this team to compete for a playoff spot.

&nbsp;

*Edit: Gar mentioned Coby White to have that learning curve. Also mentioned that Trae spending like 30 games, to get accustomed to the league. Bulls are playing for a playoff spot. White could share the back-up PG minutes with Dunn or Harrison(if Dunn gets traded). But while Dunn is still here, Bulls are going to play him majority of the minutes, to increase his trade value.*

"I like the signing and think it fits our team really well. Why was it a sign and trade though? I believe we'd have the room to sign him outright. 

I saw a few theories that thought the Wizards said they'd match otherwise, so I guess it could be that (although it seems weird given the Bulls didn't even give him an offer sheet and try signing him as an RFA before bargaining)

Normally a sign and trade is done for cap reasons, so it would have made sense if the plan was to sign someone to a contract (like Arci) and then trade for Satoransky. This also can't be it in this scenario because we didn't trade any salary out to the Wiz (like Dunn)

[Updated 2019-20 win projection for the Bulls after agreeing to deal with Tomas Satoransky](https://twitter.com/JacobEGoldstein/status/1145684486346215424).

Goldstein already predicted more wins for the Bulls than bettors, these free agents each bumped up the expected wins by between one and two wins, three wins total.  The Bulls aren‚Äôt done yet so maybe they can get it above 39 wins, or at least around 38.  

Then we need the youngest players to play better than expected and remain healthy and maybe .500 (41 wins) is in reach.  Last year that won the Pistons the 8 seed.

That would be quite a leap from 22 wins last year.

"So first of all I have to say that I‚Äôm a huge bulls fan and I‚Äôve always been higher on the bulls than I maybe should have been. But regardless of how bad last season was, I do think that from now on it‚Äôs only going to get better. I‚Äôm trying to make a few points to show that the Bulls aren‚Äôt as bad as many people think they are. 

1. **The bulls had bad luck with injuries**
Out of all bulls players only Robin Lopez, Shaq Harrison and Ryan Arcidiacono played more than 70 games last seasons. Zach missed 20 games, Lauri missed 30 and Dunn and WCJ missed almost half the season due to injury. Because of all those injuries and trades midway through the season the bulls played a total of 27 different starting lineups. Considering these stats I don‚Äôt think they really got into a grove and learned how to play together. The lineup which started most games (only 12) was made up out of Dunn, Lavine, OPJ, Markkanen and Lopez. This is also the closest to, what our expected starting lineup for next season will look like. Out of those 12 games they won 6. 

2. **Comparing the Bulls to the Sacramento Kings**
I think the Bulls can in some ways be compared to the Sacramento Kings from last season, even though the kings are further ahead in their rebuild. I first started seeing this comparison by comparing Coby with DeAaron Fox. They are both super fast players trying to push the pace at all time. Comparing their NCAA stats, they seem to be almost the exact same player. I think similar to Fox‚Äôs rookie seasons, Coby will struggle to score consistently. But, and I think this will be very important, he will change the pace the Bulls are playing at. Even though there was a lot of talk last season, about how the Bulls were trying to play faster, they ended up being mediocre with the 20th fastest pace in the league. The Kings on the other end had the third fastest pace, which translated to the 17th best offensive rating and the ninth seed in a strong western conference. I think compared to the Kings, the Bulls have some similar assets. Lavine has improved as a three point shooter and with his slashing abilities he can be compared to Buddy Hield. OPJ is a better version of Harrison Barnes and with Lauri and WCJ, the Bulls have two big man that can be very valuable in transition. I especially like the ability of Lauri to either shot the transition three or use his patented drag step when driving to the rim. 
Nevertheless the Bulls had many problems regarding their half court offense last year. Pushing the Ball in transition, creating early miss matches along with the athletic ability this young core has, can really help in that area. 

3. **3 point shooting**
As last years have shown, three point shooting is getting more and more important, since teams are starting to figure out that the 3 pointer is one of the most effective shots. While having some solid three point shooters the Bulls took the fewest 3 pointers in the NBA although they where pretty efficient shooting the 3 ball (17th in the league). With a full and healthy season of Lauri, OPJ and a willing three point shooter in Coby White, I can see that number rising while still shooting at a high efficiency. 

4. **Depth**
There were times last season when the bulls send out Blakeney, Shaq Harrison, Lopez, Brandon Sampson and Selden Jr. as their starters. Off course this was due to many injuries, but when those are the players stepping in for your starters, you‚Äôre not going to win many games. I know it wasn‚Äôt actually that bad but still pretty bad. But let‚Äôs look at next season. 
I think we can all agree on Coby White, Lavine, OPJ, Lauri and WCJ as being the staters. Maybe the Bulls are giving Dunn another chance to prove himself but I‚Äôd like to see what White can bring to the bulls as the starting PG. That would leave the Bulls with Dunn, Arc and Shaq being the main backups at PG and SG. I like the sensible upside that our backups bring. Hopefully Chandler Hutchison can develop into more of a tree and D player and backup OPJ. I do think Gafford will fit in the Bulls defense and offense as a rim protector and a rim running big, but outside of him we‚Äôre getting thin at the big positions. With a more or less successful free agency I can see the Bulls really bolstering their depth compared to last season. Of course it depends on injuries a lot. 

**Conclusion**
I could really go on and on about what improvements I think are possible. Even though I‚Äôm not overly excited about the Bulls coaching staff, I am looking forward to how the coaches are going to approach all of this potential. And even though I do think the Bulls will be making steps into the right direction, they‚Äôll need time before being a serious playoff candidate. I do think they‚Äôll still be struggling in the half court offense, with Coby White learning and adjusting to the NBA. I also don‚Äôt see the bulls improving much on the defensive end of the game. Tbh I would have loved seeing Culver fall to the Bulls at 7. With him it would have been reasonable to go all in for a player like Brogdon, which would have given you an elite shooting starting five with two solid defensive options (Dunn and Culver) coming of the bench. With Coby White though it should be the main focus pushing the pace and becoming a better offensive team and then attacking free agency in one or two years. 

In the end I don‚Äôt think the Bulls will be contending for a playoff spot next season. But who knows, maybe Lauri is going to develop into an absolute beast, averaging 25 and 10 and they will prove me wrong. Regardless of what happens I‚Äôm very excited and I really love this young team of talented players.

"Personally, I'd love to see the Bulls spend up on Malcolm Brogdon and really lock in our back court. I'd be fine giving him a deal similar to Zac's, because that will likely be the going-rate for him. But he'll be a massive defensive upgrade for our back court, and his shot is reliable enough to help our spacing immediately. 

BUT if Robin Lopez walks (very likely), I think it would be wise to add some Veteran depth to the front court. If I had my choice, I'd ink Julius Randle to a 3 yr/$36-$40 million deal. He declined his $9 mil. player option with NOLA, so I think 3/$36-$40 is fair. He balled out last year, and he can swap in/out with Lauri or Wendell fairly seamlessly. 

I also wouldn't mind going for 2-3 cheap quality vet role players to help develop our core. The likes of Pat Bev, Taj, Jeff Green, Jokhim (on a vet min only). 

The one guy I'd like to see us take a flyer on would be Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. Sure, he's the clunkiest player in the NBA, but he's only 24, and he may serve as a decent bench guy. We can give him a team-friendly 2 year contract with a team option much like we did with Jabari - but for like, waaaay less money haha. 

My concerns with signing Brogdon or Randle to longer term deals would be tying up cash before Lauri and Wendell approach free agency in a few years. But, the immediate benefit will outweigh those costs if the Bulls become competitive because you'll be able to shop them most likely.

My concerns with signing Brogdon or Randle to longer term deals would be tying up cash before Lauri and Wendell approach free agency in a few years. But, the immediate benefit will outweigh those costs if the Bulls become competitive because you'll be able to shop them most likely.

"Hey guys, this is probably not worth posting but as of today I'm officially switching to the Bulls. 

In 2005 the Houston Rockets drafted my favorite college basketball player: Luther Head. I grew up near Illinois's campus so I watched a lot of the games and I loved the number four so it was an easy choice. I loved the rockets because he went there and that's about it. Along the way I fell in love with guys like Tracy McGrady, Yao Ming, Rafer Alston, Aaron Brooks, etc.  Literally none of those guys are still on the team. I liked Pat Beverly and Montrezl Harrell, but they traded them away for Chris m-f'in Paul. I like Clint Capela but I fear he's gone soon too. I friggin hate James Harden.. All that to say, this just isn't the team I fell in love with. Now they've officially switched away from the uniforms too and it's nothing that I liked as a kid. 

Through all that, I tried to hang in there and stay loyal. Last night's award ceremony was the final straw. James Harden lost the MVP to Giannis and the rockets Twitter page instantly started bitching saying Harden deserved it over him. Basically Kanye Wested the guy. Thought it was super rude and uncalled for. The whole team just reeks of ""accumulate talent and hope they mesh"" and watching James Harden flop about for calls is quite annoying. 

So, I'm switching to the home team. I know who we just drafted, and I know that markannen is pretty good. That's about all I've got. I know the Bulls were pretty good around when I was very little and they had some pretty good ball player... Marshall Jackson or something...Michelle Gordon?  All jokes aside, I'm just ready to root for a team that I have a home connection to. 

Go Bulls!","New fan coming over from the Rockets Hey guys, this is probably not worth posting but as of today I'm officially switching to the Bulls.

"Many people have complained that they do not see a clear direction or plan of where GarPax is taking this team. With the selection of Coby White, I think the plan for this team has begun to take shape. And if this is the plan GarPax is using, it is bold, incredibly bold. I think they may be going for the most positionless team in NBA history. Now I know that sounds crazy, and you‚Äôre going to have to stick with me, as this idea requires that every player on the Bulls meets their maximum potential. But, if you‚Äôre an optimist like me who wants to believe in this roster, I think you‚Äôll like where this is going. Now here‚Äôs my argument:

**Height, and it‚Äôs value for switchability.**

Here is the projected starting lineup for the Bulls and their height/weight, and how their size relates to this positionless basketball idea.

Coby White- 6‚Äô5‚Äù 191 lbs.

Zach Lavine- 6‚Äô5‚Äù 200 lbs.

Otto Porter Jr.- 6‚Äô8‚Äù 200 lbs.

Lauri Markkanen- 7‚Äô0‚Äù 240 lbs.

Wendell Carter Jr.- 6‚Äô10‚Äù 255 lbs.

Obviously, this is a very large lineup, but also a very quick and athletic lineup, allowing for every player to potentially guard 3 positions, if everyone reaches their max potential. Zach Lavine‚Äôs height and quickness allows him the ability switch onto the 1-3 positions and be able to match up, physically at least. While Lavine is a very capable on ball defender, he often has defensive IQ lapses when it comes to team defense. In order for this plan to work he has to improve his IQ and become at least an average defender.

While Coby White is not as athletically gifted as Zach Lavine, he can make up for that with his tremendous speed and effort, as well as his considerable height. He often is caught ball watching a bit too much and overcommitting to helping as well as gambling for steals too much. He is capable of guarding both 1‚Äôs and 2‚Äôs at the moment due to his speed and effort, but his defense must be refined in order for him to be capable of defending 3‚Äôs in spot situations. While he is not as bad defensively as Zach Lavine, he will have to develop his defensive IQ and become at least an above average defender that can switch onto 3‚Äôs for this plan to be successful.

Otto Porter Jr. is a phenomenal defender, who is already capable of switching onto the 1-4 positions and doing very well. He also has the capability to defend 5‚Äôs for very limited spot minutes, as was seen last season when we were riddled with injuries and Boylen played him at center for spot minutes in a couple games.

Lauri Markkanen has shown the ability to switch onto guards with his considerable speed for a 4. However he is currently apt to being bullied in the post by bigs due to his somewhat skinny frame. He will have to bulk up in order to adequately defend 4‚Äôs and 5‚Äôs. Much like Lavine and White, he will also have to define his defensive IQ and develop into at least an above average defender.

Wendell Carter Jr. is an absolute stud defensively. His IQ is astounding, and allows him to switch onto guards even though he does not possess mind bending athleticism. His frame and IQ make him a beast when defending other bigs, and he will only get better with age and experience

**Speed, athleticism, shooting, and how it relates to a positionless offense**

Every player the Bulls projected starting lineup can be dangerous on the fast break, and all have shown the capability to handle the ball.

In the backcourt, rather than having more traditional PG, SG backcourt, I believe the plan is to develop both White and Lavine‚Äôs passing and offensive IQ‚Äôs to develop a backcourt with 2 true combo guards, who are both capable of scoring and passing well. The biggest knock on both Lavine and White is their passing ability, specifically their ability to run an offense However, both have shown to be very good in the pick and roll, which will be crucial in order to make this positionless idea work. But I don‚Äôt think either player will be asked to be a true facilitator for this team. We saw a lot of success in January when a multi ballhandler system was implemented and both should receive equal opportunities to bring the ball up the court.

With their blazing speed and Lavine‚Äôs ability to finish and traffic as well as White‚Äôs ability to stop on a dime and shoot on the break, this team should constantly be running with these 2 and letting WCJ, Otto, and Lauri trail. WCJ will be trailing and trying to get dump off passes for easy buckets at the rim, and hitting the occasional corner 3. Lauri and Otto should be looking for open 3‚Äôs on kick out passes.

But what would make the their transition game truly dangerous is Wendell Carter Jr. He shot well enough in college, shooting 41% on only 1 attempt a game, but he struggled with the 3 ball this year. If he can develop into and adequate 3 point shooter, Otto, Lauri, and WCJ could all be interchangeable in their roles on the break.

**But this is where it gets really crazy.** When the multi ball handler system was implemented, Lauri and Otto were both allowed to take the ball up the court, and did well driving to the hole or pulling up for shots. WCJ showed he has the potential to do this last summer league, where he found success dribbling up the court after grabbing a rebound. He is already and incredibly gifted passer for a big man, and if he tightens his handle and improves his shooting, that means every single player in our starting lineup is capable of bringing the ball up the court and also capable of making 3‚Äôs. This means that if WCJ, Lauri, and Otto can also master kickout passes on the break, **every single player is completely interchangeable on the fast break.**

The spacing provided by every player on the court being a respectable shooter will allow Lauri and Zach to feast in the half court, as they both succeed at driving to the hole. OPJ also does to a limited extent. With how good both Coby and Zack are passing in the pick and roll, and with OPJ being respectable, the pick and pop or pick and roll with either big man is also very dangerous. With all 5 players being able to shoot, the options are pretty much endless on offense.

**The flaws in this plan**

While any of the improvements I've suggested for each player don‚Äôt seem to crazy, other than Lavine becoming a competent defender, the likelihood of all of these improvements occurring does seem incredibly unlikely. Also, this means that every player in this lineup is good, but there is nobody who is truly special. It is commonly accepted that you need a Top 5 player in the league to win a championship, someone who can grind out tough buckets in the playoffs when everyone else is cold. This plan does not provide that. In order to help combat this, the team will most likely have to have an incredible bench as well, being able to go 11 or 12 deep at any time. Getting this much talent on a roster is incredibly difficult. Significant development for players like Chandler Hutchison, Denzel Valentine, Ryan Archidiacano, and Daniel Gafford must be prioritized just as much as the development of the players talked about above.

**Conclusion**

While this plan or true positionless basketball by GarPax, if it is what the plan actually is, is genius in theory, execution may not be the same. The idea that all of these players can become incredibly versatile 2 way players seems far-fetched. This is going to require a significant effort in developing not only the starting lineup, but the backups as well. It remains to be seen if we have the coaching staff to pull this off.

**TL;DR**

It‚Äôs Sunday and I‚Äôm bored and excited about basketball after the draft. If White, Lavine, and Markennen can develop some better defense, and WCJ can develop his jumper and ball handling, this starting lineup could be the closest thing to positionless yet. While we may lack a true superstar combating this by developing a great bench can allow us to still win a championship.

So what do you guys think? Am I completely bonkers? Probably, but it‚Äôs fun to think about.","An Analysis Of The Current Bulls Roster And The Plan For the Future Many people have complained that they do not see a clear direction or plan of where GarPax is taking this team.

If White, Lavine, and Markennen can develop some better defense, and WCJ can develop his jumper and ball handling, this starting lineup could be the closest thing to positionless yet. While we may lack a true superstar combating this by developing a great bench can allow us to still win a championship.

"Coby and Dunn are gonna eat up the bulk of the minutes at PG, so signing a free agent like Cory Joseph doesn't make sense to me. Especially when he's worse than Coby and Dunn. I'd much rather sign a backup big like Taj and/or a backup wing for depth.

Rather than signing someone like Joseph, why not bring back 1-2 of Arch, Shaq, or Lemon for a fraction of what Joseph would cost? It's already gonna be tough balancing minutes for our guards, and Joseph or whoever would make it even worse as I'm sure he'd want a guaranteed spot in the rotation.

With Arch and Shaq, you can use them in spot situations even if they're not a part of the main rotation and I doubt they'd complain. On a night when you need some grittiness to light a spark, throw Arch out there for 10 minutes. If you need more defense for a game, use Shaq a little more.

I think Lemon is as good as gone simply because his sample size was small and he doesn't bring anything to table that we don't already have.

Arch provides 3 point shooting and a Hinrichian grittiness, while Shaq provides defense, versatility and decent size.

If it was up to me I'd bring back both Arch and Shaq to round out our bench. If only one, I'd probably pick Shaq because Dunn could be gone by midseason and you can never have enough size, defense and versatility at the guard spots.","Between Arch, Shaq, and Lemon, who returns?

"#LONG POST WARNING

Coby White, Guard from North Carolina

Height: 6'5

Weight: 185

Wingspan: 6'4-6'5

#Strengths

Just looking at his measurements, the first thing that pops out is his height.  6'5 is a great size for a point guard and having him the Bulls starting lineup makes us bigger.  If I had to describe Coby White's game in one word it would be - *buckets*.  Coby has shown the capability to score on all three levels and in a variety of ways.  He can pull up from 3 or spot up from behind the arc.  He can put some moves together and create space for a midrange or use his patented step back.  He can come off screens and attack the basket with the type of speed and burst that makes you go wow.  The kid gets buckets, simple as that.

When we take a further look at his offensive stats, we see that he shot really, really well in catch and shoot situations - l**anding in the 93th percentile in the country.  Landed in the 95th percentile when it came to spot up shooting** - all points to the fact that he can play off-ball extremely well which is perfect on our team with Lavine as the leading guard.

Coming out of HS, Coby was just a strictly scoring guard but under Roy Williams, he has made great strides as a playmaker.  Now I preface this by saying he still has a long way to go but his continued improvement throughout the season is extremely promising.  He's a great passer in transition, good out of drive and kicks, and is a really good passer out of the pick n roll.  White landed in **97th percentile for passes out the PnR**.  There is promise in White's passing and its quite impressive that a year ago no one would've expected him to be able to pass the rock like this.

Coby thrives off the fast break and loves pushing the pace.  In the blink of an eye, he can go from one end to the next.  Has shown he likes to stop on a dime on the break for a J and as mentioned earlier he's an exceptional passer on the break.

Defensively, he's an active defender with quick feet and quick hands. He has the motor to work defensively and rotate through the defense.  He landed in the **75th percentile on ISO attempts as a defender**.  He has great potential on defense, I dont expect him to be an elite defender but I hope he can be solid.

#Weaknesses

The biggest gripe with Coby White is his decision making as a point guard.  He's still improving as a floor general, although he has the ability to make great passes off the PnR and in transition - he struggles in the half court making passes without the PnR.  Many times on film, you would see a player open but Coby is isoing into a bad stepback jumper instead.  Many times, Coby should've gotten the team into the proper set but instead he drove recklessly into a crowd for a TO or a bad shot.  Many times in transition, he should slow it down instead of forcing a pass.  **Although I love how he plays 100% all the time and plays full speed all the time - similar to players like Russ or more recently Fox, Coby needs to learn when to take the foot off the pedal and play with his brain**

And thats ultimately why I think his ISO and Pull Up Jumpers percentages are concerning.  Coby only landed in the **27th percentile for off the dribble jumpers and only 52nd percentile for PnR scoring and ISO**.  A big chunk of the reason is his decision making.  If he didn't take bad shots - those percentages would've been much better.  Although I would like to add many times, he was the bail-out for the UNC offense.

This is something you want to see Coby improve on.  He needs to be more selective of his shooting and know when to attack and when to be more methodical.  He has the moves, the speed, the talent to score much more efficently on these attempts.

When it comes to attacking the basket, **Coby landed in the 77th percentile when it came to scoring around the basket**.  Not bad but could be much better for an athlete like White.  To be clear, he's not a vertical-type athletic.  He's not Russ or Rose when it comes to attacking the rim.  He doesn't have the vertical leap but he has the quickness and burst of speed to attack.  People say his short wingspan is part of the reason, I also think its his overall BBIQ.  But he also needs to improve on his finesse around the basket.  This is something I have a lot of confidence he can improve on.

Defensively, his wingspan is not ideal and he can be overly aggresive going for steals etc.  Overall he needs more disciplined.

#Fit with the Bulls and potential moving forward

I think on day one, Coby can make an impact for the Bulls and contend for that starting PG role.  My reasoning is based on his ability to play off-ball and shoot.  Something Dunn can't. With Coby on the court now, we literally have 5 players who can space the floor and shoot.  This is extrmely valuable because no matter the PG we get, **Lavine is our primary ballhandler if we want him to reach All Star levels.**  Coby's ability to be a threat off the ball is perfect next to Lavine as well as his ability to be the secondary ball-handler who can create plays for himself and others.

Looking at Coby's outlook, I think it comes down to this decision making, simple as that.  If he can develop more of a PG brain and polish out his PG skills - I see no reason why Coby can't be a quality, quality starting PG for us.  **Learn how to be methodical and cerebal, learn when to take the right shots and keep improving on the already promising passing ability he has and he can be our PG for the foreseeable future .**  But worse case scenario if he doesn't develop these skills, he can still be a useful guard off the bench who can get you buckets and buckets fast.

I love this pick and I love Coby White.  He wasn't at the top of my board (although he was right up there) but his game and skillset is promising and his fit with the Bulls right now looks perfect.  On top of that, this is a high quality kid who loves to compete. There's no question of his motor, or his work ethic or his confidence (unlike other prospects *cough* Reddish *cough*).  He's been through a lot but is still a fun, happy dude.  That reaction to the Cam Johnson pick last night, made me a bigger fan of him.

At the very least with this pick, the Bulls will be watchable again next season.  The Bulls will be exciting again.

EDIT: Stats came from Synergy and I would highly recommend reading [this article](https://www.thestepien.com/2019/06/18/coby-white-scouting-report/) that gives an insightful analysis of Coby White.","An in-depth look at our number 7 pick, Coby White - Why Bulls fans should be excited #LONG POST WARNING

This is something you want to see Coby improve on.  He needs to be more selective of his shooting and know when to attack and when to be more methodical.  He has the moves, the speed, the talent to score much more efficently on these attempts.

When it comes to attacking the basket, **Coby landed in the 77th percentile when it came to scoring around the basket**.  Not bad but could be much better for an athlete like White.  To be clear, he's not a vertical-type athletic.  He's not Russ or Rose when it comes to attacking the rim.  He doesn't have the vertical leap but he has the quickness and burst of speed to attack.  People say his short wingspan is part of the reason, I also think its his overall BBIQ.  But he also needs to improve on his finesse around the basket.  This is something I have a lot of confidence he can improve on.

Defensively, his wingspan is not ideal and he can be overly aggresive going for steals etc.  Overall he needs more disciplined.

#Fit with the Bulls and potential moving forward

I think on day one, Coby can make an impact for the Bulls and contend for that starting PG role.  My reasoning is based on his ability to play off-ball and shoot.  Something Dunn can't. With Coby on the court now, we literally have 5 players who can space the floor and shoot.  This is extrmely valuable because no matter the PG we get, **Lavine is our primary ballhandler if we want him to reach All Star levels.**  Coby's ability to be a threat off the ball is perfect next to Lavine as well as his ability to be the secondary ball-handler who can create plays for himself and others.

Looking at Coby's outlook, I think it comes down to this decision making, simple as that.  If he can develop more of a PG brain and polish out his PG skills - I see no reason why Coby can't be a quality, quality starting PG for us.  **Learn how to be methodical and cerebal, learn when to take the right shots and keep improving on the already promising passing ability he has and he can be our PG for the foreseeable future .**  But worse case scenario if he doesn't develop these skills, he can still be a useful guard off the bench who can get you buckets and buckets fast.

I love this pick and I love Coby White.  He wasn't at the top of my board (although he was right up there) but his game and skillset is promising and his fit with the Bulls right now looks perfect.  On top of that, this is a high quality kid who loves to compete. There's no question of his motor, or his work ethic or his confidence (unlike other prospects *cough* Reddish *cough*).  He's been through a lot but is still a fun, happy dude.  That reaction to the Cam Johnson pick last night, made me a bigger fan of him.

At the very least with this pick, the Bulls will be watchable again next season.  The Bulls will be exciting again.

"It seems like this sub is pretty excited for Coby, and I really hope he does well. I'm not trying to shit on him, but he seems like a project with a limited ceiling. It would've been smarter to take a wing like Reddish or Sekou (both projects in their own right, but with higher ceilings).  
  
He played out of control at times at UNC. I really worry that Boylen won't put up with him making mistakes and bench him for long periods of time. He also has a 6'4"" wingspan, which severely limits his defensive potential. I don't love the idea of putting a subpar defender next to Lavine who has his own struggles defensively. 
  
In addition, next year's draft is full of guards. No, the Bulls won't be picking at the top next year (please), but there are also always plenty of guards on the market in free agency. And I know I'm probably in the minority, but I still haven't given up on Dunn. He's shown some flashes and I think he could become a good player that could even make an all-star team at some point in his career.  
  
Good NBA teams need guys who can guard multiple positions and do it well. I'm not sure Coby White will be able to guard anyone but the opposition's smallest guard.  
  
Cam Reddish, on the other hand, is a good shooter who can play 2, 3, and even (smallball) 4. He's athletic and has a 7'1"" wingspan. He played alongside two of the top three picks, so I don't think he showed everything he has to offer last year.  
   
Sekou's floor is much lower than Coby, but he could eventually turn into a point forward and play a similar role to Giannis with the Bucks (I AM NOT SAYING SEKOU=GIANNIS) where the Bulls wouldn't need a traditional point guard.  
  
The Bulls already have very good offensive talent. I don't think taking a score-first point guard with limited defensive potential was the best decision. Furthermore, the Bulls have a very good young core already in place. They should've swung for the fences with #7 or traded down and acquired more draft capital.  
  
Now, GarPax has drafted well, so I hope I'm wrong. But I wouldn't be surprised if Reddish is the better pro, both right away and in the long run.  
  
Either way, Coby seems like a great personality, and he's really talented. Here's hoping that they made the right decision.

> White, like Culver, rose up draft boards over the course of the season. He wasn‚Äôt originally supposed to be a one-and-done player, but it didn‚Äôt take long for him to show that he was the best prospect on a North Carolina team that had two other players (Cam Johnson and Nas Little) taken in the first round. White, a speed demon who pushes the pace at every opportunity, is a classic Roy Williams point guard. What makes him such an intriguing prospect is that he combines that speed with great size for the position (6-foot-5 and 185 pounds) and a good 3-point shot (35.3 percent on 6.6 attempts per game).

> One of the knocks on White coming into the draft was that he might not be ready to run an NBA offense. He can make highlight-reel passes, but he‚Äôs still a score-first guard who can get out of control at times. Few coaches at the next level will give White as much freedom as he had under Williams. Bulls head coach Jim Boylen certainly won‚Äôt. The good news for White is that while his NBA coach may not be the best fit for his game, his teammates are. Markkanen is an even more prolific 3-point shooter than Towns: He shot 36.1 percent from 3 on 6.4 attempts per game last season, the most of any 7-footer in the league. White will be playing in spacing nirvana next to Markkanen.


> It‚Äôs not just Markkanen, either. White will be the rare rookie point guard taken in the lottery who starts his NBA career with a lot of talent around him. Zach LaVine and Otto Porter Jr. are knockdown 3-point shooters, while Wendell Carter Jr. showed flashes of the ability to stretch the floor in a promising rookie season. The Bulls could run a five-out offense with shooters at every position. Porter and Carter, two of the better frontcourt passers in the league, can also take some of the playmaking pressure off White. He won‚Äôt have to do everything on offense. He can play off the ball and count on his veteran teammates to create open shots for him.

> White is a much better fit with their starters than Kris Dunn, a streaky outside shooter who can‚Äôt threaten the defense without the ball. Everything has to go through Dunn when he is in. White, on the other hand, is an excellent spot-up shooter who should be able to succeed in a smaller role in the offense. The Bulls don‚Äôt need their point guard to dominate the ball. **They have two of the most skilled young big men in the NBA and two wings who can score in LaVine and Porter.

"I just looked up OPJ stats for the bulls last season and man I‚Äôm happy we pulled of that trade. Even though it‚Äôs a pretty small sample size I‚Äôm hyped about him for the upcoming season looking at his stats. In 15 games for the bulls he scored 17,5 ppg while shooting 48/49/91. All that while being one of the best defenders on the bulls roster. Give him an off-season to train with the bulls and he only gets better. I think it should be a top priority to keep him as a piece of the bulls future since he brings so much to the team. 

I also really hope we can sign Brogdon this offseason, who is another extremely efficient shooter while not demanding many shots. Oh and he is also a really good defender. Players like Brogdon and OPJ also allow Lavine and Lauri to go and do their thing with the ball in their hands. 

Drafting whoever is available at 7 should give us some depth also. If everything is working out the way I imagine i can see us playing in the playoffs next season.","Otto Porter Jr. appreciation post I just looked up OPJ stats for the bulls last season and man I‚Äôm happy we pulled of that trade.

"The Bulls do not have the best record of *draft day trades* particularly since John Paxson and Gar Forman have taken over.

I can think of two draft night trades that did not work out but I was hoping you guys could help me remember any more.

I am separating out draft day trades from pick swaps made in other deals like the Eddy Curry Knicks trade. Only deals made on draft day are what I want to focus on.

**2006 LaMarcus Aldridge for Tyrus Thomas and Victor Khryapa**

*The move we all remember in hindsight being ridiculous since Aldridge is still in the league playing at a relatively high level and Thomas and Khryapa are not. The deal itself sounded decent enough on draft night with the Bulls betting on an athletic player with a lack of skill becoming and all star. (They'd make a few more stabs at this with James Johnson and Marquis Teague before settling in to their current draft strategy of getting guys with high floors even if that means lower ceilings)*

**2011 Norris Cole and Malcolm Lee for Nikola Mirotic**

Shoutout to /u/_finite_jest for the reminder on this one!
*The Bulls were coming off their Eastern Conference playoff loss and were positioned to be contenders for years to come with Deng, Rose, Noah, and Boozer (yes even Boozer) in the fold. They made the ECF with Keith Bogans as a starter. A month later they made this deal to acquire a mercurial stretch four in Nikola Mirotic for a late first round pick in Norris Cole and a 2nd rounder in Malcolm Lee. Mirotic's run with the Bulls had it's highlights but most remember frustration. That being said, even knowing the injury coming to Rose, keeping Cole and Lee would not have been the better move for Chicago.*

**2014 Gary Harris and Jusuf Nurkic for Doug McDermott**

*The Bulls needed a shooter and an NBA ready player who could produce some offense on second units and Doug McDermott sounded like he fit the bill coming out of college. It's just a shame that Gary Harris has completely eclipsed Doug McDermott on both ends of the floor and Jusuf Nurkic is a bonafide starting big man in the modern NBA, either of which the Bulls could use right now let alone both but it made sense at the time with how the roster looked in 2014.*

The night of the deal left many scratching their heads as the Bulls rolled the dice on another athletic wing coming off ACL surgery, a defensive minded point guard who couldn't find minutes under a defensive minded coach who never plays rookies anyway, and a relative unknown out of Arizon for a bonafide All Star. Many agreed it was the right time to move on from Butler while others felt he never got a legit chance with Chicago after being saddled with Wade and Rondo for one year. But the Bulls definitely won out in the long run with Minnesota getting rid of Jimmy to also go young and 2 out of 3 of the Bulls gambles on draft night ended up paying off.*

"Darius Garland, originally from Gary, Indiana, is the son of Winston Garland, a seven-year NBA journeyman. Over his five-team NBA career, Garland averaged 9.4 points, 4.7 assists, and 2.8 rebounds per game.

"The Bulls should be finding a way to make sure bucks can't afford brogdon and we bring him in. When he is on the floor his teams net efficiency goes up exponentially, and he is in an elite shot percentage club 50/40/90, which only Steph can claim with him in the league right now. When he has started at pg he has put up crazy good overall #s as well. He plays on and off the ball well, which would slide perfectly with Zach who likes the ball in his hands a lot as a SG. He would make us a very competitive team instantly. I would offer him as much as we can offer to get him.

Also, I see him taking a next step forward with the bulls as a starter at pg, he's not a similar player to harden, but the same way harden was over shadowed in OKC brogden has been in Milwaukee. Bring him to the bulls and we got ourselves a young stud who plays the right way. Then with the 7th we should draft Sekeo, and let him develop on the bench into a young stud who can do it all. His fade away jumper is reminiscent of KD, and the dude is 18. Watch any of  his recent training videos and you can see the dude simply has sky high potential. I don't see how you can pass that up.","Bulls Need to Land Brogdon The Bulls should be finding a way to make sure bucks can't afford brogdon and we bring him in. When he is on the floor his teams net efficiency goes up exponentially, and he is in an elite shot percentage club 50/40/90, which only Steph can claim with him in the league right now. When he has started at pg he has put up crazy good overall #s as well. He plays on and off the ball well, which would slide perfectly with Zach who likes the ball in his hands a lot as a SG. He would make us a very competitive team instantly. I would offer him as much as we can offer to get him.

Also, I see him taking a next step forward with the bulls as a starter at pg, he's not a similar player to harden, but the same way harden was over shadowed in OKC brogden has been in Milwaukee. Bring him to the bulls and we got ourselves a young stud who plays the right way. Then with the 7th we should draft Sekeo, and let him develop on the bench into a young stud who can do it all.

"**Darius Garland**

Strengths: 

- 3 Point Shooting, has the range and ability to knock them down at a high clip.  Able to come off screens for a pull up 3s as well as catch and shoot situations

- Saucy handles, has deep bag of tricks that he can utilize to get past defenders

- Passing insticts, although he had more TOs than ASTs in the 5 games he played - Garland has shown flashes of ability to become an at least solid playmaker

Weaknesses:

- Size, only 6'2

- Defense, his size is a factor but not the only factor.  He hasn't shown the IQ on that side of the floor yet.  Routinely gambles on D, often out of position, doesn't rotate well and hasn't shown any quality defensive instincts

- Playmaking, like I mentioned earlier he has shown flashes but as of right now he is strictly a score first PG that struggles with tunnel vision many times.

NBA Player Comparison Range: Anywhere from Kyrie/Dame lite to Dennis Schroder.  Someone in the middle could be: Lou Williams

**Coby White**

Strengths:

- Shot-creation; can pull up from 3, can attack from the PnR, can attack the basket.  White can score in a variety of ways.

- High motor; plays full speed almost all the time on both ends of the floor.

- Size, 6'5 iirc which is a great build for a PG esp. next to someone like Lavine

- Has the ability to be a solid playmaker - at times made great reads and got teammates involved really well last season at UNC

Weaknesses:

- Decision making; sometimes takes a bad shot wayyy too early in the shot clock.  Sometimes takes a contested shot when a man is open.  Needs to sometimes slow down the game and play more methodical

- Short wingspan; although he is a tall PG, his wingspan is only 6'4

- Although he is fast in transition, he is more of a below the rim type of player

NBA Player Comparison Range: Anywhere from Jamal Murray-lite to Jordan Clarkson.  Someone in the middle could be: Spencer Dinwiddie

**Jarrett Culver**

Strengths:

- Size; 6'7 with a 6'9 wingspan

- Scoring off the dribble; can score on all three levels as well as the ability to play off the ball being a great cutter to the basket

- Playmaking potential; with his size, Culver is able to see over a lot of guards and has shown the vision and IQ to make great reads and plays.

- Defensive versatility, extremely solid on D and can potentially guard 1-3 in the NBA level

Weaknesses:

- There are still question marks about his shooting.  Not an elite FT shooter and his mechanics are kinda clunky

- Ability to get separation on the professional level; although he is big and has a decent first step - Culver did struggle with getting good shots off on the collegiate level against good defenders

NBA Player Comparison Range: Anywhere from Butler/Derozan lite to Evan Turner.  Someone in the middle: Caris Levert

**DeAndre Hunter**

Strengths:

- Great size; 6'7 with a 7'0 wingspan. Hunter has the prototypical size you want from a modern NBA wing

- Best perimeter defender in this draft; can guard a variety of positions and has the necessary size

- Can shoot the 3

Weaknesses:

- Often too passive at times, making an unecessary pass when he is open for the 3

- Lacks the ability to consistently create off the dribble

- Can be a streaky shooter

NBA Player Comparison Range: Anywhere from Khris Middleton to Trevor Ariza.  Someone in the middle: RoCo

**Cam Reddish**

Strengths:

- NBA-level size

- Smooth looking stroke with NBA level moves 

- Bags of talent

Weaknesses:

- Horrible college season

- Decision making is poor

- Efficiency was poor

- Questions about motor

NBA Player Comparison Range: Anywhere from PG to Ben McLemore.  Someone in the middle could be: Andrew Wiggins

**Sekou Doumboya**

- Physical tools; standing ay 6'9 with a 6'11 wingspan.  He is strong, fast, has the quickness and length to really excel in today's game

- Athletic; quick off his feet and is a threat on the fast break

- Has shown the ability to shoot the 3 with good mechanics

- Defensive versatility; with his size and physical tools, he can be a great defender and even has potential to be a decent shot blocker

**Weaknesses**

- Poor basketball IQ: He's still learning the game and can often miss the simple read or make the wrong play

- Shooting is streaky and still a work in progress

- Has to improve ability to create off the dribble; his handles are high and clunky

- Overall rawness

NBA Player Comparison Range: Anywhere from Pascal Siakam to Al Faroq Aminu. 

In summary, all these strengths and weaknesses I've complied from watching film and reading a whole bunch of scouting reports.  Don't take my comparisons to heart tho, I just try to look a similar type players and their production.  I would say for each player the comparisons are super optimistic.

Overall, I'd honestly be happy if we pick any of the players listed above (although some I am wary on).","Comprehensive list of our potential draft targets **Darius Garland**

Strengths: 

- 3 Point Shooting, has the range and ability to knock them down at a high clip.  Able to come off screens for a pull up 3s as well as catch and shoot situations

- Saucy handles, has deep bag of tricks that he can utilize to get past defenders

- Passing insticts, although he had more TOs than ASTs in the 5 games he played - Garland has shown flashes of ability to become an at least solid playmaker

Weaknesses:

- Size, only 6'2

- Defense, his size is a factor but not the only factor.  He hasn't shown the IQ on that side of the floor yet.  Routinely gambles on D, often out of position, doesn't rotate well and hasn't shown any quality defensive instincts

- Playmaking, like I mentioned earlier he has shown flashes but as of right now he is strictly a score first PG that struggles with tunnel vision many times.

NBA Player Comparison Range: Anywhere from Kyrie/Dame lite to Dennis Schroder.  Someone in the middle could be: Lou Williams

**Coby White**

Strengths:

- Shot-creation; can pull up from 3, can attack from the PnR, can attack the basket.  White can score in a variety of ways.

- High motor; plays full speed almost all the time on both ends of the floor.

- Size, 6'5 iirc which is a great build for a PG esp. next to someone like Lavine

- Has the ability to be a solid playmaker - at times made great reads and got teammates involved really well last season at UNC

Weaknesses:

- Decision making; sometimes takes a bad shot wayyy too early in the shot clock.  Sometimes takes a contested shot when a man is open.  Needs to sometimes slow down the game and play more methodical

- Short wingspan; although he is a tall PG, his wingspan is only 6'4

- Although he is fast in transition, he is more of a below the rim type of player

NBA Player Comparison Range: Anywhere from Jamal Murray-lite to Jordan Clarkson.  Someone in the middle could be: Spencer Dinwiddie

**Jarrett Culver**

Strengths:

- Size; 6'7 with a 6'9 wingspan

- Scoring off the dribble; can score on all three levels as well as the ability to play off the ball being a great cutter to the basket

- Playmaking potential; with his size, Culver is able to see over a lot of guards and has shown the vision and IQ to make great reads and plays.

- Defensive versatility, extremely solid on D and can potentially guard 1-3 in the NBA level

Weaknesses:

- There are still question marks about his shooting.  Not an elite FT shooter and his mechanics are kinda clunky

- Ability to get separation on the professional level; although he is big and has a decent first step - Culver did struggle with getting good shots off on the collegiate level against good defenders

NBA Player Comparison Range: Anywhere from Butler/Derozan lite to Evan Turner.  Someone in the middle: Caris Levert

**DeAndre Hunter**

Strengths:

- Great size; 6'7 with a 7'0 wingspan. Hunter has the prototypical size you want from a modern NBA wing

- Best perimeter defender in this draft; can guard a variety of positions and has the necessary size

- Can shoot the 3

Weaknesses:

- Often too passive at times, making an unecessary pass when he is open for the 3

- Lacks the ability to consistently create off the dribble

- Can be a streaky shooter

NBA Player Comparison Range: Anywhere from Khris Middleton to Trevor Ariza.  Someone in the middle: RoCo

**Cam Reddish**

Strengths:

- NBA-level size

- Smooth looking stroke with NBA level moves 

- Bags of talent

Weaknesses:

- Horrible college season

- Decision making is poor

- Efficiency was poor

- Questions about motor

"Hear me out. Obviously the Bulls would have liked to move into the top 3. But I honestly don't think that there's a huge difference in the type of prospects available in the 4 or 7 spot. This draft basically has a solidified top 2, generally accepted #3, pretty similar prospects in that 4-7 range and then a drop at 8 where the questions arise regarding Hunter, Clarke, Hayes, etc.

 In the 4-7 spot, by most reports, it's going to be some combination of Garland, white, Culver or Reddish. The mocks are kind of all over the place in terms of who goes where but we're basically guaranteed one of the 4. And I honestly don't think there's a big difference between those guys. Obviously, it would have been nice to stay at 4 to have our pick of the litter but I don't think it's a draft where the caliber of prospect at 4 is a big difference from that at 4.

"The Lakers, in their ever shortsighted quest for star power, just sold the entire farm for Anthony Davis.

"So I was arguing with another guy in the subreddit about the bulls potentially trading for AD.  I told him it wasn't gonna happen and he said Khalil Mack wasn't gonna happen either.

(In response to him saying essentially ""well yeah and the Bears had no chance of getting Khalil Mack"" 

I get that and love the attitude, cause it's totally what bulls fans need right now. But hoping for an AD to come to the bulls is the wrong thing to wish for. 

Wish for Lauri to mature into the true next Dirk and become an ""ungaurdable when hot"" player. Wish for Zack Lavine to continue to refine his explosive offensive game while also committing himself to studying his ass off about the fundamentals of defense and ending up a half way decent defender. Wish for Wendel Carter to become at least as good as Al Horford (which is pretty good).

And then hope for something crazy to happen whether in the draft or crazy free agency magic 3 years from now, because if not, that core still can't win a championship.

"Zach Lavine was given an offer by the Sacramento Kings this off-season because he heard literally nothing from Chicago. 

Dude plays through injuries and leads our team in every way he can through coaching changes wins and losses.

He has embraced Chicago culture and reps red in every facet I‚Äôve seen him publicly.

He absolutely outplayed his contract (cap space is widening)  and returned from a significant injury with the same bounce and even upped his defensive game. 

Now we might trade him for fucking lonzo ball.

If we trade lavine - I‚Äôm honestly maybe out of the bulls. 

Nobody expects a mindset of loyalty and player development out of gar pax- but this would make that as loud as possible imo.

"Before you say anything, I am questioning my sanity with this question as well.

&#x200B;

To start, I understand that Jahlil is been wholly underwhelming in his first few seasons in the league. He represents everything that the center has moved away from, and with KAT being in the same draft class, we are able to see how the new style of play can have a huge impact in the league; leaving the traditional style behind.

&#x200B;

Despite all of this, there are a couple reasons that Jahlil may be a great fit for Chicago.

&#x200B;

1. He had a very solid stretch of games before being injured for the Pelicans.

In this stretch, Jahlil averaged  18.2 points, 9.8 rebounds and 2.0 blocks per game while shooting 67.3 percent from the field. These stats show high efficiency with a focus on defense that we have never seen from Jahlil. If he becomes as big of a scoring threat as he was expected, and a reasonable defender, he has the potential to be a great backup center.

&#x200B;

2.     He's young.

Jahlil is only 23 years old. This is younger than 13 of the players that were on the Bulls roster last year. We constantly speak towards Kris Dunn being a guy who still has time to develop, but Kris Dunn is two years older than Jahlil. There is a chance that given some time with a system that values player development, Jahlil can thrive.

&#x200B;

3.      He's a Chicago native.

Before you say anything, I know that our last experiment with Jabari Parker being a Chicago native went terribly. But, if Jahlil's floor is the same as Jabari's with how it ended up, it isn't the worst thing in the world. The upside is that Jahlil has something to prove to his home crowd and will give an increased effort due to it.

&#x200B;

Before you write it all off, consider the idea. Yes, I know it's crazy, but we're still two years away from being two years away, so maybe crazy is what we need.","Should the Bulls entertain the idea of signing Jahlil Okafor in the offseason?

&#x200B;

***JUSTIN WRIGHT-FOREMAN***

&#x200B;

***Who is Justin Wright-Foreman?***

&#x200B;

Justin Wright Foreman, or JWF because it's easier to write, is a Point guard from Hofstra University who played all 4 years. He is 6'1 with a 6'6 wingspan, 190 pounds. He's 21 years old.

&#x200B;

***Why is he a super sleeper?***

&#x200B;

He's coming off a super prolific senior year as a scorer, but projections still have him hovering around the 2nd round/undrafted range

&#x200B;

**JWF this past year:**

He averaged 27.1/4/2.9 on 51/43/86, on 64%TS !!!!

&#x200B;

*That's pretty good, but he played in a weaker conference*

&#x200B;

**Other prolific years by college guards in weaker conferences:**

&#x200B;

Jimmer =

28.9/3.4/4.3 on 45/40/89, 59%TS

&#x200B;

Steph = 

28.6/4.4/5.6 on 45/39/88, 60%TS

&#x200B;

Lillard = 

24.5/5/4 on 47/41/89, 64%TS 

&#x200B;

***So are you saying JWF is gonna be a Steph/Lillard level player?***

&#x200B;

Probably not, no

&#x200B;

***So is he just another Jimmer?***

&#x200B;

No, he's a legit NBA level athlete and has the tools to not get killed defensively

&#x200B;

***So what do you think he could be?***

&#x200B;

I think his absolute upside is somewhere around the Kemba, Lou Williams spectrum of player, and that at the very least he'll stick around the league as a bench energy/spark plug type guy. Think Blakeney, but better in nearly every way

&#x200B;

***Ok, so what kind of player is he?***

&#x200B;

 JWF is a complete, dynamic scorer 

&#x200B;

***SHOOTING:*** 

&#x200B;

JWF shot 43% from 3 this past year on a little over 7 attempts. He's a knockdown shooter off the catch and in spot up situations, but the really intriguing aspect of his shooting is his ability to pull up off the dribble, he's probably the best pull up shooter in this draft over Garland, White, and Edwards

&#x200B;

Here's some examples of his pull up shooting: [https://streamable.com/kmp79](https://streamable.com/kmp79)

&#x200B;

Here's some off the catch and spot up: [https://streamable.com/mxwsr](https://streamable.com/mxwsr)

&#x200B;

I'm not quite sure if he's a real movement shooter that can run off screens and hit shots at wild angles, but even if he isn't he'll still be a big threat beyond the 3 point line on and off ball

&#x200B;

***FINISHING:***

&#x200B;

JWF shot 69% at the rim, that's really good for a 6'1 guard

&#x200B;

Other players for reference:

JA = 61%

RJ= 64%

Cam Reddish= 51%

Coby = 67%

Carsen Edwards = 49%

Culver = 67%

Hunter = 69%

Rui = 71%

&#x200B;

He uses his combo of athleticism + length + shiftiness + touch to finish nearly everything. Add in the threat of his pull up, and he's really hard to stop

&#x200B;

Examples: [https://streamable.com/1gm4u](https://streamable.com/1gm4u)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was also really good as a cutter in the games I saw, so that adds to him as an offball threat

&#x200B;

Examples: [https://streamable.com/nj1ee](https://streamable.com/nj1ee)

&#x200B;

***Ok, so he's a great scorer, but at 6'1 he'll only be a PG. Looking at his assist numbers, 2.9 assists to 2.6 turnovers per game doesn't look so good. Can he actually run an offense?***  

&#x200B;

Yes, he definitely still needs work but I think he's far from a Blakeney type guy, who just doesn't pass. He's not nearly as bad as the numbers suggest. He's inconsistent and will miss reads sometimes, be slow on reads other times, and even sometimes make the right reads but just get the ball there too slow, but he still has a lot of flashes of being an NBA level decision maker with the ball.

&#x200B;

Here are his best moments from some of the games I watched: 

&#x200B;

JWF passing vs NC State: [https://streamable.com/mfs14](https://streamable.com/mfs14)

&#x200B;

JWF passing vs VCU: [https://streamable.com/jyzdn](https://streamable.com/jyzdn)

&#x200B;

JWF passing vs Charleston: [https://streamable.com/abfbj](https://streamable.com/abfbj)

&#x200B;

He's really comfortable operating PnRs and his patience is really good, he faced double teams constantly and never panicked or got sped up. I think that's a really valuable skill to have already coming into the NBA, obviously it will be different vs NBA level defenders + athletes but it's still translatable. His pull up shooting + scoring should help his play making too and with experience he may be able to make the right reads more consistently and more quickly 

&#x200B;

***Ok, so he may not be a lost cause as a passer. How is he defensively?*** 

&#x200B;

JWF played at the top of a zone on a terrible defense, so I think the metrics may paint him as a turnstile, but he's a capable defender. At 6'1 with a 6'6 wingspan and with his athleticism, he had some flashes of getting into a stance, sliding his feet, and not letting anyone by him, but his size does limit him. He will be a 1 position defender, He's just not very switchable and not strong enough to hang with bigger guys, he just gets bumped out of the way too often. Even when boxing out, which he did attempt a lot, he just couldn't hold his position vs bigger guy. He also does have occasional lapses where he'll gamble or fall asleep, he can die on screens, but for the most part defensively I just think he just had a neutral impact. He wasn't targeted on D or killed by anyone, but he wasn't a lockdown defender on ball or disruptive off ball either. 

&#x200B;

In the NBA I think he can be a guy who's offense outweighs whatever deficiencies he may have defensively, and if he is a liability it would be to the extent that Kyrie Irving is, not like IT. He should be able to handle guarding the majority of point guards in the NBA without being torched, and there is upside for him to be more than that due to his length + athleticism 

&#x200B;

***HIS PLACE ON THE BULLS:***

&#x200B;

We do have our fair share of guards on this team already, with Arci, Dunn, Blakeney, and Valentine (+ whatever G league guys we still have, not sure about Lemon's contract situation is) all going into next year fighting for spots, but I think JWF could still win a spot on our bench. I would bet on him being better than Blakeney, and even though I really like Arci, I think JWF's scoring could be more impactful than the stability Ryan brings. Valentine is a wildcard too at this point, we don't really know how good he'll be. 

&#x200B;

***TO SUM IT ALL UP:***

&#x200B;

JWF is one of the most complete scorers in this entire draft with every tool to be successful and efficient at it in the NBA. The question marks surrounding his game aren't big enough to warrant him not getting a shot in the NBA, and I think if we did spend a 2nd rounder on him or get him as an undrafted free agent, he could really break out in summer league and earn a spot on this team","A potential super sleeper in the 2nd round Before I say who I'm talking about, I would probably still prefer taking any one of Grant Williams, Jontay Porter, or Shamorie Ponds if they're also still there at our pick, just because they also have high ceilings for 2nd rounders and are probably safer bets than the guy I'm talking about, but if none of those guys are there then I think the move should be

"Okay so I was thinking if White and Garland are off the board at 7, what if we traded the pick to Atlanta for 10 and 17 which they recently acquired from the Nets. 

Why?

Bulls: With no point guard available we can take a chance on two different players because this draft after 3 is a crap shoot. We could probably get Doumbouya, Clarke, and or Hayes and at 17 I'd be interested in taking Keldon Johnson.

Hawks: The Hawks would do this deal because they are high on Redish and or Culver. The bulls could threaten taking Redish at 7 to force the Hawks into this trade.

"Due to the unfortunate achilles injury KD sustained last night, I believe it's now in KD's best interest to opt into his player option for next year and agree to a sign a trade with a team that promises to max him after the player option is up (similar to the Chris Paul trade). 

The trade: 
Warriors receive: OPj, WCj
Bulls receive: KD

Why KD would agree to this:
If recent reports are accurate Kevin Durant will most likely not play most or all of next season. Opting into his player option with the promises of a max contact  allows his max contract to extend deeper into his career while being paid 30 mil to rehab his injury next year. Also KD should not trust the warriors medical staff ever again. 

Why the Warriors do this:
If KD is leaving then the warriors would want to get something back for him instead of him leaving and the warriors getting nothing in return. Opj is a perfect fit for the warriors system and WCj gives them a very good young prospect in a position where they have no depth. If your wondering why the Bulls don't give up more its because KD holds the leverage in this situation because he won't sign with a team that gives up all their assets. Warriors agree to this because they know that if they want to continue to compete they need to return to their original system of strength in numbers.

Why the Bulls do it: 
Getting KD changes everything. The main reason the Bulls do this even though KD most likely doesn't play next year is because it opens the door to also acquiring Anthony Davis in 2020/21. AD and KD benefit each other perfectly in this situation. KD needs a player who can help take the load off him while he works his way back from injury and Anthony Davis needs another great player beside him so he isn't carrying a franchise on his back. Bulls will probably still be a late lottery pick in the 2019/20 season in this scenario but this would be a benefit in disguise because it will be a cheap way to add depth for the the 2020/21 season. 

2019/20 Roster (Assuming KD injured)
PG: Beverley 
SG: Lavine
SF: Reddish
PF: Lauri
C: FA on short contract (Lopez, Kanter,)
Result: don't win many games but young players continue to develope and chance of high draft pick

2020/21 Roster
PG: Beverley 
SG: Lavine 
SF: KD 
PF: Lauri
C: AD
Result: NBA champs, KD redeems his legacy by beating the warriors in the finals and credited with leading one of the biggest franchise turn arounds in League history, AD becomes a first time champion in front of his hometown. Also DRose balls out off the bench lol.

Obviously this is a crazy risky trade that our front office would never pull off but I thought it would be fun to share my fantasy. What do you guys  think of this trade? Is this possible?

**Bulls get**: Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart

**Pelicans get**: Kyle Kuzma, Lakers/Bulls pick

**Lakers get**: AD

The details I don‚Äôt remember are if the pelicans also get Ingram. I was mainly focused on who the Bulls are getting. 

He seemed pretty this was going to happen. He seemed very sure that KD and Kyrie will be playing for the Nets.

"Hey friends,

Wanted to let you guys know we just launched a new TW/IG account called Bulls Archive, that's going to dive into some really interesting Bulls content from the past, a lot of which has never been published or seen before. We have some WILD stuff from the championship years in particular and we think you guys will really dig it.

&#x200B;

Some backstory just for you guys...throughout the 90s our team photographer got all kinds of access with the team, including shots from the locker room, post-championship celebrations on the bus/plane, White House visits, etc. Since things weren't digital back then a lot of these photos ended up in slides and were undeveloped and thus haven't really been seen by the general public. They've been kept in an archive in a private room at the Bulls offices - and we actually showed the r/chicagobulls mods this room when they came in for a game this season. We'd been talking about digitizing these photos and doing something like this with them for a long time and part of what helped us get our act together and get this thing live was the interest the mods here showed in this stuff. So, thanks r/chicagobulls, for helping inspire us to create this account and show the world some of this stuff.

"At least for now.  Of course, this will probably/hopefully change (Suns will prob be youngest at the start of the season). It's nice to think that the players will grow together,  but I don't think player development works like that.   I'd argue that it's going to be hard to develop consistency without an unselfish veteran PG, and other veteran presence.  The team needs vets all over to develop the 3-4 young players that the team identifies as its future core. Markkanen and WCJ would be my picks, and I wouldn't yet commit to Lavine as part of the Bulls future core. Hopefully Lavine can improve in the ways everyone knows he should, as he and OPJ are our vets on the court. 

This team needs solid unselfish vets (like RoLo), good coaching (moving in the right direction) and a lot of patience

"What are some of your creative transaction ideas, trade or free agency, for this offseason? 

&#x200B;

Mine: Even though I like him on this team, I was thinking about a few potential deals that would send out Otto. He has a large salary that the Bulls could use to match/offset another high salary, similar to the Jabari deal that brought Otto here. 

1. Could there be a deal centered around Otto for Gordon Hayward, without giving away other big-time assets? Hayward would bring more risk but also more upside. I don't know if Boston would go for this, especially if they lose Kyrie. And Hayward is 29. But he could potentially bring some playmaking ability at a position of need. 
2. Could the Bulls pick up an asset or two from Charlotte by trading Otto for Batum? This would make the Hornets more competitive assuming Kemba returns, and more attractive for him to do so. 
3. Possibly the most off-the-wall idea (pun intended), could the Bulls construct a three-team deal that sends out Otto to a third team to receive John Wall in return? I don't think they could trade Otto back to the Wizards, so that's why a third team is involved. This would be a HUGE risk, but Wall could fill the PG hole as a hopefully long-term solution, and he is probably at his lowest value right now. Wall is 28, which is definitely older than our core, but also younger than the other big PG's that would be available for trades (Conley 31, CP3 34, Lowry 33 (if Kawhi leaves)). This option is probably too risky for GarPaxDorf. 

Creative moves like the trades of Harden, Paul George / Oladipo, Kawhi, and Ray Allen / KG have pushed other teams toward championship contention, and may be the best way for the Bulls to get there. I think the Bulls need to do what they can to get star talent on this team that complements / aligns with this young core. This is why I didn't suggest trading away any of the core, which is what would be required in a trade for AD for example. 

&#x200B;

My ideas may admittedly be trash, but let's see and discuss some of yours, even if they aren't quite fully-formed. 

&#x200B;

Side note: I think there is a real chance Otto opts out after next season as there should be big money flying around this summer and next year's class isn't nearly as impressive. Someone could give him big money (again).","Creative Transaction Ideas What are some of your creative transaction ideas, trade or free agency, for this offseason?

He had great seasons in Amityville but he wasn't Dennis Rodman he averaged close to a double double but he wasn't really a star yet and even when he really started to blossom into one around 92 to 93 the team practically fell apart so he was giving his all to a trash team at that point then he went to the Spurs where Dennis Rodman became the guy we no and love but he didn't fit the culture and he was crazy their it wasn't memorable.

He was practically in his prime in Chicago and Dennis said it would mean the world for him to get his jersey hung up in the rafters their. After the 95 loss to the Magic, Jordan said they were a rebounder away from winning and that's what they were lacking and Dennis was the answer to the problem. The Bulls wouldn't have 3-peated without Rodman. He was robbed of the 96 mvp.

A similar comparison is Andre Iguodola he had his better individual seasons in Philly but he was more vital in Golden State. But Rodman to me had his best years in the Windy City and Worm deserves to be worshipped the same way as MJ and Scottie.","Why Dennis Rodman Should Be Remembered as a Bull Despite what Isiah said about how we should forget the Bulls cuz he had his best years in Detroit I call bullshit cuz yeah he averaged 19 boards and about 8 points for 2 seasons their after the glory but even Dennis feels he shouldn't have his jersey retired their cuz he really wasn't a star on that team more of a piece important but not really a beast yet.

"I am intrigued by these recent rumors of us not drafting a PG at 7. 

At first glance, it doesn't make much sense given our roster situation and our need for a young cornerstone PG. But you have to consider that outside of Morant, this is a weak class for point guards. Garland and White, despite having their moments, are too risky to take a chance on and have too many flaws.

Instead of reaching on a PG, we should draft the best player available. We should look to draft a wing -- ideally Culver, Hunter, or Reddish -- in a draft loaded with them. You can't have enough wings in today's NBA, and we would be getting the best value at pick 7.

We can easily address our need for a point guard in free agency by signing a reliable veteran such as Darren Collison or Pat Beverly to a short-term deal, and then we can get a cornerstone point guard in a draft next year that is full of quality options.

&#x200B;

However, we could also look into trading the pick for a PG. I've seen a lot of rumors linked to Lonzo Ball, who still has a lot of upside and wouldn't be a bad option, but we could also look into less-mentioned options like Jrue Holiday (if the Pelicans trade AD and rebuild) or Bradley Beal (who can run the offense with Lavine).","Case for the Bulls to not draft a point guard at 7 I am intrigued by these recent rumors of us not drafting a PG at 7.

"I've seen a little speculation on whether or not players want to play for the Bulls. Some users say that free agents don't want to play for the bulls. Some users say that's all a media creation. 

But we don't have to speculate! We have almost 72 (heh) years of data to work with. But I don't have 72 years of time, so I'm just gonna start from the year 2000 because that's where I wanna start and you can't make me start anywhere else.

So let's look at my semi-arbitrary selection of who was the Bulls' most important free agent addition of that year. I'm not gonna include the Bulls signing their own players, because the conversation is usually about players COMING to the Bulls. And also because that's what I feel like doing and, as I said before, you can't make me do anything else.

The format will be year, player name and the player's previous year PER‚Äîthat way we get some indication of the player the Bulls believed they were signing. If you want me to add something else... yeah. That's right. 

**2000 Brad Miller (18.43 PER, 35th in the league)**

The Bulls signed a top 40 player this year! I always loved Brad because he could shoot, he picked a fight with Shaq, and because if Rondo hadn't clotheslined him in that Celtics series, the Bulls would've advanced to the next round. He's responsible for the greatest play that Vinny Del Negro ever drew up.

**2001 Eddie Robinson (17.9 PER, 48th in the league)**

This guy's Illinois license plate said Phenom. Which meant that Mark Prior was driving around in his car around the same time with Phenom22 or Ph3nom or some shit while ERob was averaging nine points a game.

**2002 Donyell Marshall (19 PER, 37th)**

This poor guy was born 12 years too early. I mean, it's hard to feel too bad for a guy who's 6'9"" and wildly, wildly rich, but still‚Äîdude could handle, shoot the three, and kinda rebound on occasion. He'd be on posters today.

**2003 Scottie Pippen (15.22 PER, 113th)**

I would see Scottie sometimes waiting in the lobby of a building I lived in and I'd immediately turn into a 9 year old boy. And he was at the SoHo House for a 90s party once. I offered the DJ $100 to play Sirius. The DJ declined. Unlike the DJ, Scottie was worth every goddamn cent.

**2004 Andres Nocioni (2004 PER: 10, 279th)\***

Those of you too young to remember our announcers talking about how Andres Nocioni was gonna put the clamps on LeBron James for six years, take a moment a reflect on the luck you have to be born into a modern society. Nocioni was beloved in the same way that Tom Waddle was, mostly for sucking, trying hard, and being white. If his name was Dre Nash, no one would remember him.

\*Maybe he wasn't a free agent signing, I can't really remember and this year is depressing enough without searching for who it'd really be.

**2005 Othella Harrington (8.95 PER, 302nd)**

Those numbers may look horrible, but I actually remember Othella pretty fondly (I may overvalue a big who can shoot from the elbow). Othella he wasn't terrible for the Bulls! He was thoroughly mediocre! Plus Othella Harrington is a dope basketball name, like a guy with frilly shoulder pads, a feathered hat and curly toe shoes is about to drop silky low-key j after silky low-key j on you.

**2006 Ben Wallace (17.43 PER, 58th)**

I was so psyched for this signing. And, every time you start to defend the front office, remember that there was big-time racist bullshit about whether or not Ben Wallace was allowed to wear a goddamn headband IMMEDIATELY upon him signing. So. Stupid. That doesn't change the fact that Ben wasn't great for the Bulls, but he's an awesome player. He was also the biggest free agent that year if I remember correctly, so hats and headbands off to the front office for this one. 

**2007 Joe Smith (8.51 PER, 312th)**

Was he the biggest signing this year? I couldn't tell. But he was a former number 1 pick, so there's that. I think he cost Minnesota two number one picks or something. All so that he could average 13, then 10, points for the TWolves for two seasons. Woof. I'll say this for Joe Smith in 2007: that man for sure played 50 games for the Bulls in the 2007-2008 season.

**2008 Lindsey Hunter (8.93 PER, I couldn't find it but somewhere around 296th)**

Ughhhhhhh this is depressing how much longer do I have to do this? TEN MORE YEARS? Send help. 

I'm also realizing that I probably accidentally sorted the page rank for Joe Smith on points per game instead of PER, but fuck it, how much of a difference could it have made?

**2009 Jannero Pargo (11.9 PER, 223rd)**

You guys can argue about who I should‚Äôve put here, but they were all pretty shitty and I have a soft spot for irrationally confident gunners. Plus, there‚Äôs this guy who used to post on Blogabull as Jamero Pargo and always recommend the Bulls sign or start Jannero Pargo. He‚Äôs not the funniest dude in the world, but the bit is genius. Pargo played for the Bulls for about 25 years and shot 12% from 3. 

**2010 BOOZE CRUISE (21.20, 18th)**

Boozer‚Äôs story about the time that Prince rented his mansion is worth his salary alone. Boozer‚Äôs a goddamn legend. He‚Äôs one of the few NBA players to successfully put one over on an NBA owner. Secure that bag. His hair is amazing. He sonned LeBron with that pick. And every time he yelled holdat it was the best.

Was he an ultimately disappointing basketball player? Was he a consolation prize? Sure. But he was fun as hell. 

**2011 Rip Hamilton (15.63 PER, 114th)**

We all thought that Rip Hamilton was gonna save us. That is depressing in retrospect.

**2012 Kirk Hinrich (9.27 PER, 306th)**

I should just gush about how awesome Nate Robinson was for the Bulls, but there was this time that I spent a bunch of money to watch the Bulls play the Knicks the year they had Pau and Derrick. Rose was out. Noah was out. Melo was out. So I had paid a ton of money to watch Kirk Goddamn Hinrich start for the Chicago Bulls in 2015. Late-stage Kirk Hinrich is the Neifi Perez of the Bulls. If you own a Hinrich jersey, you‚Äôre at least a little racist. If you got it when you were a kid, your parents are racist for encouraging that type of behavior. Hinrich once dunked on a fastbreak in his rookie season and the announcers acted like he had jumped over a 7 footer. How incredible! A 6‚Äô4‚Äù NBA player can slam dunk!

He‚Äôs gonna be the Bulls‚Äô head coach for a decade.

**2013 Mike Dunleavy (13.56 PER, 184th)**

Here‚Äôs the thing: this signing made a ton of sense. Dude was a 3 and D player. But like, remember how excited you got about signing Mike Dunleavy? Why are we doing this to ourselves? We‚Äôre starving rats chewing on moist grocery store circulars. They‚Äôve convinced us that we have to feel this way. Guys. We got PSYCHED for Mike Dunleavy.

50/50 odds that John Paxson has masturbated to the memory of this signing.

**2014 Pau Gasol (19.20 PER, 37th)**

Ya‚Äôll hated on Pau, but there‚Äôs an argument that he was the best signing this millenia. Just because he made getting rebounds and blocks look easy doesn‚Äôt mean that they didn‚Äôt happen.

Also, if you could be anyone in the NBA in the last 30 years, wouldn‚Äôt it be Pau Gasol? He‚Äôs a giant among men, handsome as hell, grew up rich in the most beautiful place in the world, can play piano, forgot more about wine and opera and fancy shit than you‚Äôd ever be able to learn, and he‚Äôs more charming in his third language than you and I are in our first. If we invent a quantum leap/time machine crossover, I‚Äôm coming for Pau Gasol.

**2015 Aaron Brooks (12.48 PER, 227th)**

Thibs made so many shitty players seem good that they should‚Äôve hired him to direct the second season of True Detective. 

**2016 Wade/Rondo (W: 20.36 PER, 36th) (R: 16.79 PER, 93rd)**

Let‚Äôs not lie to ourselves: we would‚Äôve built a statue to Wade if he had come here in 2010. But instead we talked ourselves into hating him for making a choice that came down to:

Winning championships in unbearably cold winters, paying super high taxes, and sprinting to club parties in a wintry mix

Or

Winning championships on a white sand beach, paying no taxes, and walking to pool parties full of swimsuit models in for a weekend from France

You‚Äôd make the same choice he did.

Also, because Rondo slapped Brad Miller, I missed out on some peak awesome basketball because I thought I had to hate him. Dude talked shit to and D‚Äôd up LeBron after Wade broke his arm on the court. Rondo was cool.

**2017 Justin Holiday (12.69 PER, 215th)**

So I guess Justin Holiday got us Chandler Hutchinson, who‚Ä¶ 8.96 PER in the regular season, but he was hurt, so let‚Äôs see what he did in summer league‚Ä¶ 11.2pharrrrrrrrrttttttttt noiiiiiisessssssssssssss. The best thing about Justin Holiday is that he means there‚Äôs only one more name on this list to go. 

**2018 Jabari Parker (16.92 PER, 84th)**

I‚Äôm coming home again. Do you think about me now and then?

Signing Jabari Parker was buying a ticket to see 2018 Kanye and really hoping for 2008 Kanye. But you got 2018 Kanye. 

You knew all along you were going to get 2018 Kanye.

It sucks that this dude tore his ACL a couple of times, but I‚Äôm glad he got paid out anyway. I don‚Äôt know if you can count him as a positive just because he was included in the OPJ trade‚Äîit seemed like at that point Washington had decided to suicide itself and was swallowing whatever we had in the medicine cabinet to shed wins‚Äîbut go ahead and do that if you like. 

How do you spend that much money on a clear bust? I think that maybe the front office fantasizes about proving the stats people wrong. Paxson didn‚Äôt win in an era of advanced stats, so picking a player who‚Äôs so roundly shat upon and having that person succeed would validate his inner biases about knowing the game, blah blah. But that almost never happens, so, good luck to us all as we look forward to drafts full of slow, white shooters who can‚Äôt really shoot. CAN‚ÄôT WAIT.

**Bulls FA Signings Average PER: 14.83**

**So, roughly, you should expect the Bulls to sign a player like Luke Kornet. GET HYPED!**

Oh god I‚Äôm finally done. I thought I could keep a cheery irreverence throughout, but man, the reminder of the years of shit that I had to talk myself into getting excited for really drained me. I‚Äôve been a fan since the before-championship Jordan era, so I‚Äôve seen my fair share of awesome stuff, but I‚Äôve also seen decades of mayonnaise sandwiches. I moved away from Chicago a few years ago, and one of the side effects was this: I became a fan of the NBA more than the Bulls. I just accepted that Reinsdorf was never going to be more interested in anything than a perennial 5th seed, since that‚Äôs where he probably makes peak income. Rooting for the Bulls started to feel like rooting for someone else‚Äôs 401k. By turning my swords into plowshares, I got to appreciate LeBron, Giannis, old Rondo, and all the other fun parts of the league. By all means, enjoy the Bulls, but if you‚Äôre slogging through a Bulls-Wizards game in the hopes that they show Bobby Portis what‚Äôs up, my guy, just turn the channel. This is one of the most exciting eras of the NBA. Don‚Äôt miss out on it entirely because you‚Äôre waiting for Kris Dunn to figure out a jump shot. 

Sidenote: did I occasionally copy and paste win shares or playoff PER where I should‚Äôve posted regular season PER? Probably. Fix it for me if you want. If not, stay flagrant.","What kind of free agents do the Chicago Bulls sign? (OC) I've seen a little speculation on whether or not players want to play for the Bulls. Some users say that free agents don't want to play for the bulls. Some users say that's all a media creation. 

But we don't have to speculate! We have almost 72 (heh) years of data to work with. But I don't have 72 years of time, so I'm just gonna start from the year 2000 because that's where I wanna start and you can't make me start anywhere else.

So let's look at my semi-arbitrary selection of who was the Bulls' most important free agent addition of that year. I'm not gonna include the Bulls signing their own players, because the conversation is usually about players COMING to the Bulls. And also because that's what I feel like doing and, as I said before, you can't make me do anything else.

The format will be year, player name and the player's previous year PER‚Äîthat way we get some indication of the player the Bulls believed they were signing. If you want me to add something else... yeah. That's right. 

**2000 Brad Miller (18.43 PER, 35th in the league)**

The Bulls signed a top 40 player this year! I always loved Brad because he could shoot, he picked a fight with Shaq, and because if Rondo hadn't clotheslined him in that Celtics series, the Bulls would've advanced to the next round. He's responsible for the greatest play that Vinny Del Negro ever drew up.

**2001 Eddie Robinson (17.9 PER, 48th in the league)**

This guy's Illinois license plate said Phenom. Which meant that Mark Prior was driving around in his car around the same time with Phenom22 or Ph3nom or some shit while ERob was averaging nine points a game.

**2002 Donyell Marshall (19 PER, 37th)**

This poor guy was born 12 years too early. I mean, it's hard to feel too bad for a guy who's 6'9"" and wildly, wildly rich, but still‚Äîdude could handle, shoot the three, and kinda rebound on occasion. He'd be on posters today.

**2003 Scottie Pippen (15.22 PER, 113th)**

I would see Scottie sometimes waiting in the lobby of a building I lived in and I'd immediately turn into a 9 year old boy. And he was at the SoHo House for a 90s party once. I offered the DJ $100 to play Sirius. The DJ declined. Unlike the DJ, Scottie was worth every goddamn cent.

**2004 Andres Nocioni (2004 PER: 10, 279th)\***

Those of you too young to remember our announcers talking about how Andres Nocioni was gonna put the clamps on LeBron James for six years, take a moment a reflect on the luck you have to be born into a modern society. Nocioni was beloved in the same way that Tom Waddle was, mostly for sucking, trying hard, and being white. If his name was Dre Nash, no one would remember him.

\*Maybe he wasn't a free agent signing, I can't really remember and this year is depressing enough without searching for who it'd really be.

**2005 Othella Harrington (8.95 PER, 302nd)**

Those numbers may look horrible, but I actually remember Othella pretty fondly (I may overvalue a big who can shoot from the elbow). Othella he wasn't terrible for the Bulls! He was thoroughly mediocre! Plus Othella Harrington is a dope basketball name, like a guy with frilly shoulder pads, a feathered hat and curly toe shoes is about to drop silky low-key j after silky low-key j on you.

**2006 Ben Wallace (17.43 PER, 58th)**

I was so psyched for this signing. And, every time you start to defend the front office, remember that there was big-time racist bullshit about whether or not Ben Wallace was allowed to wear a goddamn headband IMMEDIATELY upon him signing. So. Stupid. That doesn't change the fact that Ben wasn't great for the Bulls, but he's an awesome player. He was also the biggest free agent that year if I remember correctly, so hats and headbands off to the front office for this one. 

**2007 Joe Smith (8.51 PER, 312th)**

Was he the biggest signing this year? I couldn't tell. But he was a former number 1 pick, so there's that. I think he cost Minnesota two number one picks or something. All so that he could average 13, then 10, points for the TWolves for two seasons. Woof. I'll say this for Joe Smith in 2007: that man for sure played 50 games for the Bulls in the 2007-2008 season.

**2008 Lindsey Hunter (8.93 PER, I couldn't find it but somewhere around 296th)**

Ughhhhhhh this is depressing how much longer do I have to do this? TEN MORE YEARS? Send help. 

I'm also realizing that I probably accidentally sorted the page rank for Joe Smith on points per game instead of PER, but fuck it, how much of a difference could it have made?

**2009 Jannero Pargo (11.9 PER, 223rd)**

You guys can argue about who I should‚Äôve put here, but they were all pretty shitty and I have a soft spot for irrationally confident gunners. Plus, there‚Äôs this guy who used to post on Blogabull as Jamero Pargo and always recommend the Bulls sign or start Jannero Pargo. He‚Äôs not the funniest dude in the world, but the bit is genius. Pargo played for the Bulls for about 25 years and shot 12% from 3. 

**2010 BOOZE CRUISE (21.20, 18th)**

Boozer‚Äôs story about the time that Prince rented his mansion is worth his salary alone. Boozer‚Äôs a goddamn legend. He‚Äôs one of the few NBA players to successfully put one over on an NBA owner. Secure that bag. His hair is amazing. He sonned LeBron with that pick. And every time he yelled holdat it was the best.

Was he an ultimately disappointing basketball player? Was he a consolation prize? Sure. But he was fun as hell. 

**2011 Rip Hamilton (15.63 PER, 114th)**

We all thought that Rip Hamilton was gonna save us. That is depressing in retrospect.

**2012 Kirk Hinrich (9.27 PER, 306th)**

I should just gush about how awesome Nate Robinson was for the Bulls, but there was this time that I spent a bunch of money to watch the Bulls play the Knicks the year they had Pau and Derrick. Rose was out. Noah was out. Melo was out. So I had paid a ton of money to watch Kirk Goddamn Hinrich start for the Chicago Bulls in 2015. Late-stage Kirk Hinrich is the Neifi Perez of the Bulls. If you own a Hinrich jersey, you‚Äôre at least a little racist. If you got it when you were a kid, your parents are racist for encouraging that type of behavior. Hinrich once dunked on a fastbreak in his rookie season and the announcers acted like he had jumped over a 7 footer. How incredible! A 6‚Äô4‚Äù NBA player can slam dunk!

He‚Äôs gonna be the Bulls‚Äô head coach for a decade.

**2013 Mike Dunleavy (13.56 PER, 184th)**

Here‚Äôs the thing: this signing made a ton of sense. Dude was a 3 and D player. But like, remember how excited you got about signing Mike Dunleavy? Why are we doing this to ourselves? We‚Äôre starving rats chewing on moist grocery store circulars. They‚Äôve convinced us that we have to feel this way. Guys. We got PSYCHED for Mike Dunleavy.

50/50 odds that John Paxson has masturbated to the memory of this signing.

**2014 Pau Gasol (19.20 PER, 37th)**

Ya‚Äôll hated on Pau, but there‚Äôs an argument that he was the best signing this millenia. Just because he made getting rebounds and blocks look easy doesn‚Äôt mean that they didn‚Äôt happen.

Also, if you could be anyone in the NBA in the last 30 years, wouldn‚Äôt it be Pau Gasol? He‚Äôs a giant among men, handsome as hell, grew up rich in the most beautiful place in the world, can play piano, forgot more about wine and opera and fancy shit than you‚Äôd ever be able to learn, and he‚Äôs more charming in his third language than you and I are in our first. If we invent a quantum leap/time machine crossover, I‚Äôm coming for Pau Gasol.

**2015 Aaron Brooks (12.48 PER, 227th)**

Thibs made so many shitty players seem good that they should‚Äôve hired him to direct the second season of True Detective. 

**2016 Wade/Rondo (W: 20.36 PER, 36th) (R: 16.79 PER, 93rd)**

Let‚Äôs not lie to ourselves: we would‚Äôve built a statue to Wade if he had come here in 2010. But instead we talked ourselves into hating him for making a choice that came down to:

Winning championships in unbearably cold winters, paying super high taxes, and sprinting to club parties in a wintry mix

Or

Winning championships on a white sand beach, paying no taxes, and walking to pool parties full of swimsuit models in for a weekend from France

You‚Äôd make the same choice he did.

Also, because Rondo slapped Brad Miller, I missed out on some peak awesome basketball because I thought I had to hate him. Dude talked shit to and D‚Äôd up LeBron after Wade broke his arm on the court. Rondo was cool.

**2017 Justin Holiday (12.69 PER, 215th)**

So I guess Justin Holiday got us Chandler Hutchinson, who‚Ä¶ 8.96 PER in the regular season, but he was hurt, so let‚Äôs see what he did in summer league‚Ä¶ 11.2pharrrrrrrrrttttttttt noiiiiiisessssssssssssss. The best thing about Justin Holiday is that he means there‚Äôs only one more name on this list to go. 

**2018 Jabari Parker (16.92 PER, 84th)**

I‚Äôm coming home again. Do you think about me now and then?

Signing Jabari Parker was buying a ticket to see 2018 Kanye and really hoping for 2008 Kanye. But you got 2018 Kanye. 

You knew all along you were going to get 2018 Kanye.

It sucks that this dude tore his ACL a couple of times, but I‚Äôm glad he got paid out anyway. I don‚Äôt know if you can count him as a positive just because he was included in the OPJ trade‚Äîit seemed like at that point Washington had decided to suicide itself and was swallowing whatever we had in the medicine cabinet to shed wins‚Äîbut go ahead and do that if you like. 

How do you spend that much money on a clear bust? I think that maybe the front office fantasizes about proving the stats people wrong. Paxson didn‚Äôt win in an era of advanced stats, so picking a player who‚Äôs so roundly shat upon and having that person succeed would validate his inner biases about knowing the game, blah blah. But that almost never happens, so, good luck to us all as we look forward to drafts full of slow, white shooters who can‚Äôt really shoot. CAN‚ÄôT WAIT.

**Bulls FA Signings Average PER: 14.83**

**So, roughly, you should expect the Bulls to sign a player like Luke Kornet. GET HYPED!**

Oh god I‚Äôm finally done. I thought I could keep a cheery irreverence throughout, but man, the reminder of the years of shit that I had to talk myself into getting excited for really drained me. I‚Äôve been a fan since the before-championship Jordan era, so I‚Äôve seen my fair share of awesome stuff, but I‚Äôve also seen decades of mayonnaise sandwiches. I moved away from Chicago a few years ago, and one of the side effects was this: I became a fan of the NBA more than the Bulls. I just accepted that Reinsdorf was never going to be more interested in anything than a perennial 5th seed, since that‚Äôs where he probably makes peak income. Rooting for the Bulls started to feel like rooting for someone else‚Äôs 401k. By turning my swords into plowshares, I got to appreciate LeBron, Giannis, old Rondo, and all the other fun parts of the league. By all means, enjoy the Bulls, but if you‚Äôre slogging through a Bulls-Wizards game in the hopes that they show Bobby Portis what‚Äôs up, my guy, just turn the channel. This is one of the most exciting eras of the NBA. Don‚Äôt miss out on it entirely because you‚Äôre waiting for Kris Dunn to figure out a jump shot. 

Sidenote: did I occasionally copy and paste win shares or playoff PER where I should‚Äôve posted regular season PER? Probably. Fix it for me if you want. If not, stay flagrant.",31,53,What kind of free agents do the Chicago Bulls sign? (OC),https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/bvbmxt/what_kind_of_free_agents_do_the_chicago_bulls/

EDIT: From the comments and messages I got, I now better understand it. Nothing really going on with our team at the moment and just bullshitting on the internet for fun until the draft. I just like having a tight Bulls community to check in on and was caught off guard but what I thought were random memes. It‚Äôs honestly all good, GO BULLS!

What did I miss? What is with all of the unfunny, low-quality Bulls vs Suns memes? Something about having better content/memes? Everything I‚Äôve seen on this sub today has been hot garbage and an embarrassment. As if 82,000 subscribers peaced out for the offseason and the same group of 13yr olds are posting terrible memes about the Suns. 

I‚Äôm a lifelong Bulls fan but I‚Äôm subscribed to several teams‚Äô subreddits, but ours has turned into a dumpster fire. 

How about we share our first Bulls games, pics of cool memorabilia, what we think about the draft, some interesting euro players, encounters with players in real life, articles written about our players/organization, etc. I‚Äôll start off...

The best Bulls game I‚Äôve ever been into was the Game 6 triple overtime win against the Celtics. It was Noah‚Äôs coming out party, Rose blocked Rondo, Brad Miller hit some big shots and the UC was exploding. When Rondo pushed Hinrich into the scorers table all he‚Äôll broke loose in the stands. That being said, Captain Kirk is for sure one of my favorite Bulls, our all-time leader in 3 pointers made.

"I was belligerently drunk at the indy 500 on Sunday and my uncle was chauffeuring my brother and I back to our place so we didn't get lost or some dumb shit.

He had to stop by some country club in downtown Indy to get something and me and my bro saw the pool from the car and decided it was good idea to bust in and go for a swim. We get into the pool and right before we were about to jump in freaking Jim Boylen walks right past us. I wasn't sure so I said ""hey coach"" in the least subtle way possible and he turned and stopped.

He talked to my bro and I for a good 20 minutes about the Bulls and other random stuff. Just a really nice dude. He knew we were plastered from the race, but he thought it was cool we were big Bulls fans. 

We talked about the draft and I think I drunkenly told him they should draft Cam Reddish if he's there haha.

He said something along the lines of ""I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by the Bulls this year."" then gave us his contact info and offered to get us tickets when we are back in town.

Rambling story, but it was really nice of him to talk to me and my bro when he had no obligation to. I've been pretty jaded by the Bulls front office the last few years, but meeting Coach restored my faith a little bit. Pumped for this season.

TLDR: Super drunk on race day. Met coach. He was a nice dude.","Race day chance meeting I was belligerently drunk at the indy 500 on Sunday and my uncle was chauffeuring my brother and I back to our place so we didn't get lost or some dumb shit.

"I've heard podcasts and seen posts where there is general optimism regarding the Bull's playoff odds next year. You see suggestions going after Kemba or Conley, even if they were added I don't see it. I cannot put together a picture where this team wins anything close to 41 games next year. 

&#x200B;

This made me curious about the actual odds. I went back to 2005 and found only 10 of 196 (5%) Lottery Teams improved at least 19 games and made playoffs next season. Ultimately, I found 1 team in the past 15 years that somewhat fit the Bulls description. 

&#x200B;

**19+ Jump in Wins from Lottery to Playoffs**

17-18 76ers, 52 Wins, +24 from prior - Simmons Rookie Season, Embiid 1st healthy season

14-15 Cavs, 53 Wins, +20 from prior - Lebron returns, flipped Wiggins for Love

14-15 Bucks, 41 Wins, +26 from prior- 2nd Year Giannis, Parker's rookie season

**13-14 Bobcats, 43 Wins, +22  from prior - 2nd Year Kemba, added Al Jefferson**

13-14 Blazers, 54 Wins, +21 from prior - 2nd Year Lillard

12-13 Nets, 49 Wins, +22 from prior - Traded for Garnett and Pierce, acquired Kierlenko

09-10 Thunder, 50 Wins, +27 from prior - 3rd Year Durant, 2nd year Russ, rookie Harden and Ibaka

08-09 Heat, 43 Wins, +28 from prior - Healthy Wade played +30 games from prior season, Rookie Beasley

07-08 Celtics, 66 Wins, +42 from prior - Traded for Garnett, Allen, 2nd year Rondo

06-07 Raptors 47 Wins, +20 from prior - 3rd year Bosh, Bargnaini Rookie Season 

&#x200B;

3 / 10 are major acquisitions;  the Bulls simply won't match inflow of talent (Cavs, Nets, Celtics)

5 / 10  had a future no-doubt all-NBA player and added a top 3 pick (76ers, Bucks, Thunder, Heat, Raptors)

1 / 10  (Blazers) fit better as next year's best case scenario with an ascendant Lillard w/ Batum and Aldridge at their prime coming off a 33 win season

1 / 10   is somewhat analogous to the Bulls ...  The 2013-2014 Bobcats. 

This team was lucky, they had a negative point differential and outperformed expected win total by 3 games; they were swept in the 1st round of the playoffs and missed the playoffs the next season. They maxed out as a 6th in '15-16, losing in the 1st round of the playoffs.","Bulls Playoff Odds Next Year I've heard podcasts and seen posts where there is general optimism regarding the Bull's playoff odds next year.

The logic behind this post is simple. He is the best center(if Zion is not going to be considered one) prospect in the draft, with Bol Bol killing his draft value. Bruno Fernando is not near Hayes upside.


Hawks, Wiz, Hornets and Celtics  could really use his length. In the event that Bulls can't trade him, he could play off Wendell. And given Wendell wouldn't be able to play 30 mpg, giving Hayes 20 mpg would be ideal for his development.


I'll still take DeAndre Hunter over him though. But if Reddish or Culver falls at 7th, I rather have Hayes. With the abundance of wing players in the draft, picking the only valuable center in the draft, gives the Bulls more trade value than picking a wing.","Would you draft Jaxson Hayes as trade bait?

"I don't think the Bulls should pick Cam Reddish. He is a lottery pick because of his original projections and size/athleticism, and not how he actually played in college. Now I know he had to take a bit of a back seat to Zion and RJ getting their shots, but he still left a lot to be desired. His shooting was underwhelming. His playmaking was alright but it's not like he's an amazing passer or anything. I understand his size and athleticism is impressive, but he has so much work to do in skill development.

I think it's fine to take a risk at 7, but I actually don't think Reddish is really a risk. I think he's going to be bad. I would much rather the Bulls take Hunter if available. He's also a 3&D player with good size, except he showed up this year in all aspects. If Hunter isn't available, I would look at White, Doumbouya, and Clarke over Reddish. I really think he's gonna bust.

"*The timing of this is unfortunate, given the game he played last night, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been looking at for a while, so I assure you there‚Äôs no recency bias here.*

Let‚Äôs start with the two obvious bumps in the road. 

Leonard is still under contract for next season, and is set to make $11.2m next season, which is a bit hefty given the player he is, but since we‚Äôre only set to pay Asik $3m next year (compared to the $11.2m he got this season), I think there‚Äôs room to take Leonard‚Äôs contract on, especially if there‚Äôs a chance of him re-signing for less the following summer. 

**Why Leonard then?**

As of right now, our frontcourt is looking pretty thin, with just WCJ, Lauri and Felicio under contract for next season, with Felicio being of little use. In other words, we should look to add at the very least one guy that could be of some use coming off the bench. 
Leonard‚Äôs a 7‚Äô1‚Äù, 255lbs guy that can play both at the 4 and the 5, with a pretty all-around skillset and is a solid 3P shooter. He‚Äôs also still fairly young at 27.
Provided we‚Äôre unable to re-sign RoLo, Leonard could help fill the hole he‚Äôll leave behind him, without severely limiting our options of bringing in a vet to help mentor our young bigs. 
Leonard is also raised in Illinois and went to U of I, and could potentially like to return to his home state after 7 years in Oregon. 

**How?**

This one is trickier. 
Portland is currently projected to be roughly $14 million above the cap, and that‚Äôs before possibly retaining Aminu, Hood, Curry or Kanter, and they‚Äôre widely considered to currently be carrying 3 bad contracts in Turner, Harkless and Leonard (all expiring in 2020. 

However, their cap situation could inspire them to try and move all three in the upcoming off-season or at the deadline, in order to free up at the space to add or retain pieces they value more. The Bulls, meanwhile, is currently committed to about $82m in salaries for next season, despite being able to retain most of our players from last year. The obvious, potential, departure is RoLo, but we should be able to retain Archie, and possibly Selden, for cheap, leaving us roughly $27m of cap room. 

Ideally, any trade for Leonard would include Felicio, but given his salary and contract length, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs unlikely (at least on its own), but perhaps doable with addition of other pieces or 2nd round picks. 

Other guys I‚Äôd be willing to part ways would be Valentine, Dunn (assuming we draft a PG and sign a vet PG) and - happily - Blakeney, but neither is likely to be considered attractive by the Blazers.

"The Bulls are still currently rebuilding and seem to be a few pieces away from reaching the playoffs but there is some hope that the current players on the roster have the beginnings of a solid core. With the team as it currently stands they have a promising shooting guard prospect who improved his playmaking ability and demonstrated he could score consistently at the professional level in Zach Lavine, a veteran 3pt shooter who is versatile enough to guard multiple positions in Otto Porter, a 7-foot marksmen from 3 in Lauri Markkanen, and a versatile center who has shown glimpses of his talent on both ends of the court in Wendell Carter Jr.. What this team does lack, however, is a point guard who can help alleviate some of the playmaking burdens that Zach Lavine had to carry during the 2018-2019 season and offer some ability on the defensive end of the court. With how the Bulls lottery shook out it looks as though Zion Williamson and Ja Morant will be gone and the fact that Darius Garland will potentially have been selected before the Bulls pick it looks as though improvements at PG position will either come through adding a veteran in free agency, in the form of Coby White, or as this article will discuss, via trade.

There are rumors floating out there in the offseason that the Chicago Bulls are considering trying to trade for Lakers‚Äô point guard Lonzo Ball. If the season were to start tomorrow the Bulls point guard position would probably belong to Kris Dunn who unfortunately has not played all that well since his arrival two seasons ago in the Jimmy Butler trade. The most likely scenario for a Lonzo Ball to the Bulls trade would be centered around the 7th pick in this year's draft. Theoretically, this addition in the form of a draft pick would allow Los Angeles to select a player or use the pick as a piece to flipped in a trade with the New Orleans Pelicans. While the Lakers have not really expressed interest in trading Ball the potential offering of the 7th pick by the Bulls could entice them to pick up the phone should the Bulls come calling.

I believe that this avenue of exchanging a draft pick for Lonzo Ball would be a smart move for the Bulls, as Lonzo has shown throughout his NBA career so far that he brings at least two things to the table in his playmaking and in his ability to play defense at a high-level. Both of these strengths meld well with one of the Bulls current building blocks in Zach Lavine who has shown deficiencies in those two areas. Not only will Ball bring strong passing and playmaking abilities that will alleviate some of the time Lavine has to take on the role of creating shots for others and himself, but Ball‚Äôs addition would also give the Bulls a better shot at containing other teams guards on the defensive end.

It‚Äôs unlikely that a Lonzo Ball deal gets completed before the Anthony Davis saga has been resolved, as Lonzo could be a part of the trade package the Lakers‚Äô would offer to the Pelicans. There is also the possibility that Ball could be on the move in a three-team trade that could involve the Bulls in some capacity. Although currently there is no evidence that the Lakers are looking to trade their young guard outside of the Anthony Davis Trade Negotiations, but the Bulls are certainly showing interest in trading for him and have shown signs of potentially moving the seventh pick as a means to add Lonzo Ball to their young core. From a basketball perspective, it seems that a player like Ball would mesh well with the current core of the Bulls. Now it is just a matter of seeing if the Lakers show interest in the trade with the Bulls and if so how much the Bulls front office will have to include in order to add the polarizing young lead guard.","Hey Guys, I wrote an article about Lonzo Ball and the potential of him landing in Chicago. I know its probably not well written but maybe some of you will enjoy. Kinda just wanted to write an article about the Bulls and share some opinions on them trying to acquire young talent. The Bulls are still currently rebuilding and seem to be a few pieces away from reaching the playoffs but there is some hope that the current players on the roster have the beginnings of a solid core. With the team as it currently stands they have a promising shooting guard prospect who improved his playmaking ability and demonstrated he could score consistently at the professional level in Zach Lavine, a veteran 3pt shooter who is versatile enough to guard multiple positions in Otto Porter, a 7-foot marksmen from 3 in Lauri Markkanen, and a versatile center who has shown glimpses of his talent on both ends of the court in Wendell Carter Jr.. What this team does lack, however, is a point guard who can help alleviate some of the playmaking burdens that Zach Lavine had to carry during the 2018-2019 season and offer some ability on the defensive end of the court. With how the Bulls lottery shook out it looks as though Zion Williamson and Ja Morant will be gone and the fact that Darius Garland will potentially have been selected before the Bulls pick it looks as though improvements at PG position will either come through adding a veteran in free agency, in the form of Coby White, or as this article will discuss, via trade.

There are rumors floating out there in the offseason that the Chicago Bulls are considering trying to trade for Lakers‚Äô point guard Lonzo Ball. If the season were to start tomorrow the Bulls point guard position would probably belong to Kris Dunn who unfortunately has not played all that well since his arrival two seasons ago in the Jimmy Butler trade. The most likely scenario for a Lonzo Ball to the Bulls trade would be centered around the 7th pick in this year's draft. Theoretically, this addition in the form of a draft pick would allow Los Angeles to select a player or use the pick as a piece to flipped in a trade with the New Orleans Pelicans. While the Lakers have not really expressed interest in trading Ball the potential offering of the 7th pick by the Bulls could entice them to pick up the phone should the Bulls come calling.

I believe that this avenue of exchanging a draft pick for Lonzo Ball would be a smart move for the Bulls, as Lonzo has shown throughout his NBA career so far that he brings at least two things to the table in his playmaking and in his ability to play defense at a high-level. Both of these strengths meld well with one of the Bulls current building blocks in Zach Lavine who has shown deficiencies in those two areas. Not only will Ball bring strong passing and playmaking abilities that will alleviate some of the time Lavine has to take on the role of creating shots for others and himself, but Ball‚Äôs addition would also give the Bulls a better shot at containing other teams guards on the defensive end.

"Rome wasn‚Äôt built in a day.

We were gifted one of the greatest basketball talents to ever walk this earth only to have injuries derail what looked to be such a bright future for the team, the city, and most importantly, for Derrick. 

We pushed through. A late first round pick we made became a star and he led our team as best he could. We were dealt a shit hand and he tried to make the most of it, but ultimately, it was in the team‚Äôs best interest and in Jimmy‚Äôs to part ways. We got 2 potential superstars in return. 

That was 2 years ago. In 2 years, we‚Äôve gone from an aging team that looked to be stuck in the bottom of the eastern playoffs to a young team with a bright future, albeit little to show for it in the present standings. Rebuilds take time, and time is our friend as we develop and add to our young talent.

I‚Äôll repeat that. *Rebuilds take time*.

I‚Äôm seeing so many people on this sub who think that, because we have the 7 pick again, we‚Äôre going to be stuck in mediocrity forever. That the guys we have can‚Äôt lead us to anything but low playoff seeds and disappointing ends to our future seasons.

Let‚Äôs stop that. Let‚Äôs let our guys develop before we tell them what they can and can‚Äôt do. Let‚Äôs give them a chance to play healthy, as a unit. Let‚Äôs give them the opportunity to actually reach their prime before determining what their prime is going to be.

Let‚Äôs remember that Jimmy was a 30th pick. If there is a bulls fan who saw that pick and genuinely believed he would turn into an all star, I‚Äôd be glad to let you read my palm. But jimmy didn‚Äôt care what we thought. He wanted to be great.

Zach works his ass off. Lauri works his ass off. Wendell works his ass off. I‚Äôm not in the bulls locker room to confirm this, but every report I see about their work ethics is filled with nothing but praise for these guys. So let‚Äôs let them work. Let‚Äôs let them be great. Let‚Äôs support them as they grow instead of begging for more at each and every opportunity. 

We will be fine. I have a burning hatred towards Aaron Rodgers that can only be remedied by sacks and interceptions, but there is one thing he‚Äôs done right. Ever. In his whole life.

"Let me start this by saying Ja is a better prospect than Coby, but the dropoff between them is not steep. Coby White is still a pretty good prospect in this draft and IMO on the same level as Ja and Darius Garland

&#x200B;

**Coby vs Garland**

Coby is just as good of a prospect as Darius Garland, if not better. One reason why is that even though he shares a lot of the same strengths as Garland, his weaknesses are not as glaring, here are a few ways he's better than Garland

&#x200B;

**Durability =** This is an obvious one, but Coby didn't tear his meniscus and Darius Garland did. I don' think it'll be a debilitating issue going forward for Garland, but its definitely not something you want in a prospect

**Size =** Coby is 6'4 with a 6'5 wingspan. Definitely not great,  but it gives him good positional size at PG and it means he may hold up at the 2 vs favorable matchups. Darius Garland is 6'2 with a 6'5 wingspan, again really not far behind Coby but it makes him a 1 position defender.

**Passing =** Coby is not a pure point guard, but he's still ahead of Darius Garland as a playmaker. Garland didn't have a strong track record as a passer in high school, and in his college games he averaged 2.6 assists to 3 turnovers per game. Even though its a small sample size, that's a concern and shows he might not have a great feel for the game, or at least a natural one as a passer. Coby white averaged 4.1 assists to 2.7 TOs, not great but he's not a liability as a passer the way garland might be 

Here's a small example of the type of playmaker Coby is:  https://twitter.com/SKPearlman/status/1110667216222072833 

**Defense =** Coby's size gives him the edge here. He's also a willing, energetic defender, which I think Garland might be too but his size limits him a little more than Coby

Here's a few clips of him on defense:

 [https://www.redteamscouting.com/coby-white-defense](https://www.redteamscouting.com/coby-white-defense) )

&#x200B;

Coby ranks out better in nearly every area, so I think he's the better defender

&#x200B;

**Fit =** Coby is the better fit. Now I know that some people don't care about fit and are all about ceiling, which I get, but team construction limits a player's ceiling. We saw it in the playoffs this year with Ben Simmons, put him in a Bucks, 4 out offense and he's a much better player in the halfcourt. Darius Garland isn't a great fit for us for a few reasons

\- He'll be limited defensively. Having him, Zach, and Lauri in our lineup will make it very tough to have a good defense overall, all 3 (well Lauri isn't as bad as them) will have to take big leaps to make our defense viable 

\- He's not a true PG, he's just another mouth to feed and point Zach hasn't shown itself to be a real longterm option 

\- He lacks versatility and will have no place on our team if we end up taking a PG next year. Next year looks stacked at PG and we could get a PG just as good or better than him with an even later pick than 7 if we do end up better. If we draft a new guy next year, then we'd just be shelving Garland to backup PG, which kind of diminishes his value. Coby can fill in at PG and SG, so he gives our roster more flexibility. 

He solves none of the issues we had at the PG position last year aside from bringing spacing, which is cool but probably not enough. Coby is a step down from Kris as a defender, and he's probably not as good a passer, but the dropoff from KD to Coby in those areas is not nearly as drastic as it would be for KD to Garland

&#x200B;

**Coby's Strengths** 

They're pretty much the same as Darius Garland's, he's a dynamic ball handler and shooter, off the catch and dribble, and he has some creativity finishing around the rim. He also has an extra gear speed wise that Darius Garland doesn't have 

&#x200B;

**C O B Y    IS   C O O L =** hes fun to watch

&#x200B;

**Shooting =** He's not as great a shooter as Garland, and he only shot 35% on the year, but he's still one of the best in the draft and a clear step up from Kris Dunn. 

&#x200B;

Shooting off the dribble = He's a real shot creator and confident off the dribble, watch on all these pullups how much separation he's able to create, especially with his stepback. I do believe his % actually isn' that great on pullup 3s, but it's definitely a skill that he can become more consistent/efficient at when he learns to change speeds better and can work on setting his feet more consistently. He also had a pretty green light at North Carolina, so he took pretty much whatever he wanted, when reigned in more he'll definitely be more efficient 

[https://streamable.com/iaq0z](https://streamable.com/iaq0z)

&#x200B;

Shooting off the catch = he can play off-ball for us too, again I don't have the exact % he finished at, but as of February 26th he was shooting 44% on 108 catch and shoot attempts, and I think he can be a real threat running off screens 

&#x200B;

**Ball Handling =** Coby is kind of a bizarre ball-handler. He looks pretty stiff when dribbling because he does dribble it a little too high, and that's hurts him a little in terms of turnovers + explosiveness, but he still creates a ton of space and can do some really impressive stuff 

I don't know a ton about body mechanics, but here's a few guys on twitter that do discussing how tweaking his handle to keep it low could make him an even better ball-handler than he already is: 

https://twitter.com/NBEinstein/status/1109849354901307392 

&#x200B;

Here's a compilation of him splitting double teams, he does it a ton:  https://twitter.com/ZachMilner13/status/1121178211033858048 

&#x200B;

Here's a few cool clips of his ball-handling: [https://streamable.com/lik45](https://streamable.com/lik45)

&#x200B;

And then again, watch the streamable I put of him shooting off the dribble, he creates so much space on his stepback

&#x200B;

**Transition =** Coby is really dynamic in transition and might be the fastest player in this years draft 

Some examples: [https://streamable.com/mtytd](https://streamable.com/mtytd)

Coby's transition game is a perfect fit for how we played in February, when we actually used all our young athletes to run up and down the floor and Lauri had the best month of his career (26/12), so if Boylen actually does go back to that Coby can thrive

&#x200B;

**Finishing =** Coby is probably never gonna be a great finisher because he lacks explosiveness as a leaper and he has short arms, but he does pull off some crazy, Kyrie-esque finishes at times

Here's a few montages of Coby that show some of them:

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw65V2Ot7T8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw65V2Ot7T8) 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnWTmZ7VeDQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnWTmZ7VeDQ) 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5rGxJriw\_U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5rGxJriw_U) 

&#x200B;

He shot 63.8% at the rim. For reference (as of 2/27):

RJ Barrett shot 62.2%

Ja Morant shot 63.8%

So, even though those two will likely end up better finishers (well RJ needs to get a lot better as a decision maker) I think it shows finishing isn't really a big concern for Coby

&#x200B;

If Coby does perfect his pullup jumper though and lowers his handle, he could be a guy like Steph who creates open looks at the rim by playing off his shot, and like all prospects he will look at a lot better with NBA spacing

&#x200B;

**TO SUM IT ALL UP:** I think missing out on Zion is one of the worst things to happen to this franchise in its entire history, but once we get past the mourning of that, Coby isn't the worst outcome. I keep seeing complaints about him and people wishing we could have at least got Darius Garland, but he's really not a step down and I don't think a lot of people here really know too much about his game. He's still gonna be a solid NBA guy at the least, and he will be more fun to watch than any PG we had last year (sorry Arci and KD), and he's still super young so there's upside there. My #1 choice at 7 would actually be to trade down, but if we don't Coby is a fine option who fits the modern NBA perfectly. Remember Jamal Murray was the 7th pick of his draft, and he may be Coby's closest comp, so I wouldn't write off the possibility of Coby becoming a really good player. Dynamic shooters, especially one's with stepbacks, are all the rage right now, and Coby can be one.","This was a 1 man draft, and Coby White is still as good a consolation prize as anyone we could've gotten 2-6 Let me start this by saying Ja is a better prospect than Coby, but the dropoff between them is not steep.

**C O B Y    IS   C O O L =** hes fun to watch

&#x200B;

**Shooting =** He's not as great a shooter as Garland, and he only shot 35% on the year, but he's still one of the best in the draft and a clear step up from Kris Dunn. 

&#x200B;

Shooting off the dribble = He's a real shot creator and confident off the dribble, watch on all these pullups how much separation he's able to create, especially with his stepback. I do believe his % actually isn' that great on pullup 3s, but it's definitely a skill that he can become more consistent/efficient at when he learns to change speeds better and can work on setting his feet more consistently. He also had a pretty green light at North Carolina, so he took pretty much whatever he wanted, when reigned in more he'll definitely be more efficient 

[https://streamable.com/iaq0z](https://streamable.com/iaq0z)

&#x200B;

Shooting off the catch = he can play off-ball for us too, again I don't have the exact % he finished at, but as of February 26th he was shooting 44% on 108 catch and shoot attempts, and I think he can be a real threat running off screens 

&#x200B;

**Ball Handling =** Coby is kind of a bizarre ball-handler. He looks pretty stiff when dribbling because he does dribble it a little too high, and that's hurts him a little in terms of turnovers + explosiveness, but he still creates a ton of space and can do some really impressive stuff 

I don't know a ton about body mechanics, but here's a few guys on twitter that do discussing how tweaking his handle to keep it low could make him an even better ball-handler than he already is: 

https://twitter.com/NBEinstein/status/1109849354901307392 

&#x200B;

Here's a compilation of him splitting double teams, he does it a ton:  https://twitter.com/ZachMilner13/status/1121178211033858048 

&#x200B;

Here's a few cool clips of his ball-handling: [https://streamable.com/lik45](https://streamable.com/lik45)

&#x200B;

And then again, watch the streamable I put of him shooting off the dribble, he creates so much space on his stepback

&#x200B;

**Transition =** Coby is really dynamic in transition and might be the fastest player in this years draft 

Some examples: [https://streamable.com/mtytd](https://streamable.com/mtytd)

Coby's transition game is a perfect fit for how we played in February, when we actually used all our young athletes to run up and down the floor and Lauri had the best month of his career (26/12), so if Boylen actually does go back to that Coby can thrive

&#x200B;

**Finishing =** Coby is probably never gonna be a great finisher because he lacks explosiveness as a leaper and he has short arms, but he does pull off some crazy, Kyrie-esque finishes at times

Here's a few montages of Coby that show some of them:

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw65V2Ot7T8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw65V2Ot7T8) 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnWTmZ7VeDQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnWTmZ7VeDQ) 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5rGxJriw\_U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5rGxJriw_U) 

&#x200B;

He shot 63.8% at the rim. For reference (as of 2/27):

RJ Barrett shot 62.2%

Ja Morant shot 63.8%

So, even though those two will likely end up better finishers (well RJ needs to get a lot better as a decision maker) I think it shows finishing isn't really a big concern for Coby

&#x200B;

If Coby does perfect his pullup jumper though and lowers his handle, he could be a guy like Steph who creates open looks at the rim by playing off his shot, and like all prospects he will look at a lot better with NBA spacing

&#x200B;

**TO SUM IT ALL UP:** I think missing out on Zion is one of the worst things to happen to this franchise in its entire history, but once we get past the mourning of that, Coby isn't the worst outcome. I keep seeing complaints about him and people wishing we could have at least got Darius Garland, but he's really not a step down and I don't think a lot of people here really know too much about his game. He's still gonna be a solid NBA guy at the least, and he will be more fun to watch than any PG we had last year (sorry Arci and KD), and he's still super young so there's upside there. My #1 choice at 7 would actually be to trade down, but if we don't Coby is a fine option who fits the modern NBA perfectly. Remember Jamal Murray was the 7th pick of his draft, and he may be Coby's closest comp, so I wouldn't write off the possibility of Coby becoming a really good player. Dynamic shooters, especially one's with stepbacks, are all the rage right now, and Coby can be one.",97,177,"This was a 1 man draft, and Coby White is still as good a consolation prize as anyone we could've gotten 2-6",https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/bpb59a/this_was_a_1_man_draft_and_coby_white_is_still_as/

"I get it, you're disappointed. You feel like this season of sucking ass was worth nothing and there's no hope for next year. What are we going to do, sign Darren Collison? Roll out Pat Beverly at point guard next year and hope we sneak our way into the 7th or 8th spot. Just good enough to not luck into a stud in the next draft?

Fuck that noise. Let's talk about some options to continue to build this team into a future contender. These aren't totally in our control and some are more reasonable than others. 

1. Ja isn't dropping to us and trading up would require parting ways with a piece like Lauri. Not worth it. Kiss Ja goodbye. It's fine, he's not a sure thing. Neither is Darius Garland, but there is a CHANCE he's there for us. Yeah, the Suns draft before us, but the Suns are also the worst run franchise in the NBA. I mean look at who they've drafted the last 4 years. If they make a mistake and don't take Garland, he's the easy choice here. If they do take Garland he would have sucked anyway because, and I can't stress this enough, they're the Suns.

2.  Draft Coby White. I get it. Drafting Coby after a few months of wet dreams about Zion and Morant isn't getting anybody excited. But point guards are notoriously hard to scout. It's why Lillard went 6th, why Steph went 7th, Jrue went 17th, Kemba went 9th, etc.  Coby White is a hell of a scorer. He can create his own shot. He's not explosive, but he's quick as shit. If a perimeter player can't knock down an open 3, he's a huge liability on offense -- look at Ben Simmons in the playoffs this year. Coby could be our Jamal Murray, and that wouldn't be a bad consolation prize at all.

3.  Trade the 7th Pick (plus or minus small pieces) for Lonzo Ball. The Lakers are in asset collection mode to outbid other suitors for Anthony Davis. Lonzo doesn't fit the LeBron timeline at all. He's a tenacious defender and a pass first point guard that will get the ball to Lauri, OPJ and LaVine where they want it, when they want it.  Giving New Orleans the 4th and 7th pick to go with Brandon Ingram for Anthony Davis is a hard package to say no to. 

4.  Draft best player available. There are a lot of likely stud roll players in this draft. Guys that will be able to be on the floor in the 4th quarter of a finals game. Again, it's not as sexy as Zion, I get it. But adding another guy who won't get hunted on either end of the court in the playoffs is valuable. There's a reason why wings that can shoot and defend and offer some ancillary playmaking get huge contracts and this draft has some studs. (DEAR GOD DON'T DRAFT REDDISH).

5.  Trade down. Similar to 4, we just need to get as many bites at the apple as we can. If a team like Boston or Atlanta that was a few later picks wants to trade up because they like a guy that's sitting around at 7, we can pick up an additional first rounder. All stars are found all over the draft, if we don't like what's at 7, adding another pick is okay with me.

6.  Draft literally anyone else besides Reddish. Some front office is going to talk themselves into this prototypical NBA athlete. Guy has no idea how to play basketball. This is the only result that should make people step back and kill themselves.

I gotta shit. So this is the end.","Deep breath, options with the 7th pick. I get it, you're disappointed.

He's a tenacious defender and a pass first point guard that will get the ball to Lauri, OPJ and LaVine where they want it, when they want it.  Giving New Orleans the 4th and 7th pick to go with Brandon Ingram for Anthony Davis is a hard package to say no to. 

4.  Draft best player available. There are a lot of likely stud roll players in this draft. Guys that will be able to be on the floor in the 4th quarter of a finals game. Again, it's not as sexy as Zion, I get it. But adding another guy who won't get hunted on either end of the court in the playoffs is valuable. There's a reason why wings that can shoot and defend and offer some ancillary playmaking get huge contracts and this draft has some studs. (DEAR GOD DON'T DRAFT REDDISH).

5.  Trade down. Similar to 4, we just need to get as many bites at the apple as we can. If a team like Boston or Atlanta that was a few later picks wants to trade up because they like a guy that's sitting around at 7, we can pick up an additional first rounder. All stars are found all over the draft, if we don't like what's at 7, adding another pick is okay with me.

6.  Draft literally anyone else besides Reddish. Some front office is going to talk themselves into this prototypical NBA athlete. Guy has no idea how to play basketball. This is the only result that should make people step back and kill themselves.

I gotta shit. So this is the end.",113,46,"Deep breath, options with the 7th pick.",https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/botmuq/deep_breath_options_with_the_7th_pick/

"#Draft Pick

There are people enarmored with Coby White as the 7th pick, but I'm not one of them. I just don't see him as a top 10 pick because of his low upside. Average athlete on the PG position and short wingspan. I got the Bulls drafting the BPA, which I assume either of Reddish, Culver or Hunter. Drafting a wing is logical, given Otto's could be a free agent after this season). There will be no security on the SF position, as Hutchison really haven't shown us anything. That leaves the Bulls with the point guard position to address. 

#Point Guard Position

Paxson has been vocal about improving on the PG position. And since Bulls won't get a good point guard prospect from the draft, this off-season is their best bet to land one. 

1. Kyrie Irving(27)
2. Ricky Rubio(28)
3. Kemba Walker(29)
4. Averay Bradley(28) - team option
5. D'Angelo Russell(23) - RFA
6. Emmanuel Mudiay(23) - RFA
7. Malcolm Brogdon(26) - RFA
8. Patrick Beverley(31) - Vet
9. Derrick Rose(30)  - Vet

My first choice here would be DLo. 6'5 with almost 6'10 wingspan and fits Bulls core timeline. With Fleming on board, there would be familiarity. And hopefully Mark Adams would join too, so I wouldn't worry much of their defense. I highly think DLo could be the guy that would give Dunn the push. Younger and just got paid. Bulls could just shift one or the other, depending on who develops or fit with the team. Bulls will have two big PG prospect with long wingspan(Dunn is 6'5 with 6'9 wingspan) to develop.

#2019 and 2020 free agency

With how the draft goes, I will personally put my ambition of landing KD or AD in 2020, or any of the elite wings(Jimmy, Kawhi or Klay) this off-season. Bulls will need to develop their stars internally. And the likely free agent stars they'll land, is someone they need to develop(like DLo as I already mentioned). 


I expect the Bulls to spend their cap space this off-season as compared to 2020. Only AD fits our core timeline and his not likely coming here. Bulls will risk having to stick with Dunn at PG position, if they can't find a long term replacement. And the best bet is this off-season.","Bulls future(Draft, PG and free agency) #Draft Pick

So we have the 38th in this year‚Äôs draft, and I think Jontay Porter is a perfect match for us 

Little background info for those that don‚Äôt know him: 

He‚Äôs Michael Porter Jr‚Äôs brother, a 6‚Äô11 center who also played at Mizzou. He had a pretty good freshman year and was set to be a 1st rounder last year, but he decided to return to school. Then right before the NCAA season in October of 2018, he tore his ACL + MCL and it was announced that he‚Äôd miss the entire year. Then in March of this year, it was announced he re-tore his ACL while working out for the draft. Real bummer for a super talented kid.

These injuries obviously have killed his draft stock. His durability is now a major question mark, especially considering his family history. Everyone on this sub probably remembers his brother Michael, who missed virtually his entire 1 and done season and slipped in the draft over concerns about him having back issues. He also has 2 sisters, one who was forced to retire from basketball after tearing her ACL 5 times, and another who had to retire from volleyball because of ongoing knee problems 

Jontay already wasn‚Äôt that great of an athlete, so after these knee injuries most people are guessing that the little mobility he had to begin with has been completely sapped 

So why is he the perfect fit for us? 



REASON 1: 2nd round picks don‚Äôt matter, there‚Äôs no real risk for us. Garpax literally sell them off, there‚Äôs a pretty good chance they‚Äôll sell this one off too. The ones we actually have kept have all flopped too 

We took Paul Zipser in 2016, out the NBA now 

Cameron Bairstow in 2014, out of the NBA now

Erik Murphy in 2013, out of the NBA now 

The list goes on and on, 2nd rounds picks basically never work out, so we‚Äôre (probably) not missing out on anything even if Jontay is never healthy 





REASON 2: Nikola Jokic‚Äòs success in this year‚Äôs playoffs are showing that a skilled big can be successful even with athletic limitations. Jokic is probably stronger than Jontay and he has a longer wingspan so I‚Äôm not saying Jontay is the next Jokic, but he‚Äôs a real, skilled perimeter player that can shoot, pass, and dribble at a really high level for a 6‚Äô11 guy.

He shot 36% from 3 and 75% from the line, and his jumpshot is the most guard-like of any big I‚Äôve ever seen (aside from KD, but you know what I mean) 

Here‚Äôs a game where it‚Äôs on full display: https://youtu.be/AECUHKkWrXk

Here‚Äôs another season highlight video where you can see small glimpses of how skilled he is: https://youtu.be/kjHTdFesHpU


Defensively he‚Äôll struggle guarding in space like Jokic does and he doesn‚Äôt have the same physical tools to help defending in the post, but he‚Äôs still a really smart, capable defensive player 

He‚Äôs a high IQ player on both ends and can handle the ball and stretch the floor at the 5. Sounds familiar? That leads me into 




REASON 3: He‚Äôs the perfect Wendell Carter backup because he‚Äôs almost a Wendell clone !!

Let‚Äôs play the player A, player B game. Try and figure out which one in Wendell and which one is Jontay based off strengths form their pre draft scouting reports 


From the ringer draft guides: 

Player A:

- Excellent passer from all over the floor; he makes quick reads and delivers accurate passes. Could become one of the NBA‚Äôs better passing bigs

- Elite screener for his age; he could develop into a multidimensional screening threat on the pop, short roll, and dives.

- Good shooter off the catch; a creative coach could even utilize him off screens since he‚Äôs effective setting his feet after movement.


Player B:

- Great passer for his position who makes quick reads and throws accurate dimes from all areas of the floor.

- Knows exactly how to position himself on the court on cuts, screens, and rim runs.

- Good shooter from 3 off the catch, with smooth mechanics that should translate to the NBA line.


From The Stepien: 

Player A

* Outside shot looks very promising. Shooting 48.6% from three on 37 attempts so far, and 72.5% from the stripe. Smooth and confident shot in mid-range areas.


* Plus feel for the game. Has a 1:1 A/TO ratio, shown the ability to pass on the move and in the high post. Projects well to ‚Äúshort-roll‚Äù situations as a decision maker.


* Good handle for a big guy. Has shown flashes of attacking closeouts and taking big guys who press up on him off the dribble. Could develop an off-the-dribble shot.


* Pretty good awareness defensively. Disciplined about rotating to the rim and challenging shots. Makes up for his relatively slow feet with smart positioning.


* Does the little things on offense well. Good screener for a young big guy, knows how to play high low, seals his man when guard penetrates his way. Handle and smarts will allow him to function in dribble handoff sets.


Player B

* High-level shooter for a big man. Has a quick and compact release, and is comfortable shooting in pick-and-pop or spot-up situations. Shooting 37.7% from three on an encouraging 8.1 3PA/40 and 76.5% at the line. Projects to be a true shooting 5 in the NBA.


* Elite court vision and passing. Great at kicking out of doubles in the post, decisive and smart in the way he swings the ball around the perimeter. Will be a dynamic passer in ‚Äúshort-roll‚Äù situations in the NBA.


* Fantastic handle for a big guy. Comfortable attacking closeouts and putting the ball on the deck in transition. His shooting, passing, and dribbling combination make him a difficult guard in pick-and-pop situations.


* Extremely smart help defender. Always in the right position making backline rotations. Gets a lot of ‚Äúpoint-of-release‚Äù blocks because he is in the right place.


* Gets himself involved in the action offensively. A good screen setter with a good sense of angles and is always looking to find someone to screen, or advance the offense in some way.

A= Jontay 
B = Wendell 

Stepien: 
A= Wendell 
B= Jontay 


Now, my similarities are cherry picked, and Jontay comes up short in a few areas vs Wendell like in terms of physical tools and low post game, and even if healthy he‚Äôs not as good a prospect as Wendell, but I think if he can retain some semblance of mobility, he can be the perfect backup to Wendell. 

The Nuggets have Mason Plumlee as a backup for Jokic and he‚Äôs been really effective for them in part because he‚Äôs also a really good passing big man, so the nuggets don‚Äôt have to change their play style as much vs if they had someone like Robin Lopez coming off the bench, so Jontay could potentially be that guy for us 



So to sum it all up: Jontay is a very skilled big man who can be a real piece for us off the bench if healthy, and using our 2nd rounder to gamble on his health is a high upside move with no real risk 

Here‚Äôs a more detailed, thorough breakdown on Jontay‚Äôs game that explains it a lot better than I did: 

https://www.thestepien.com/2018/08/16/preseason-thoughts-jontay-porter/","Jontay Porter is the perfect 2nd round pick for us 
So we have the 38th in this year‚Äôs draft, and I think Jontay Porter is a perfect match for us 

Little background info for those that don‚Äôt know him: 

He‚Äôs Michael Porter Jr‚Äôs brother, a 6‚Äô11 center who also played at Mizzou. He had a pretty good freshman year and was set to be a 1st rounder last year, but he decided to return to school. Then right before the NCAA season in October of 2018, he tore his ACL + MCL and it was announced that he‚Äôd miss the entire year. Then in March of this year, it was announced he re-tore his ACL while working out for the draft. Real bummer for a super talented kid.

These injuries obviously have killed his draft stock. His durability is now a major question mark, especially considering his family history. Everyone on this sub probably remembers his brother Michael, who missed virtually his entire 1 and done season and slipped in the draft over concerns about him having back issues. He also has 2 sisters, one who was forced to retire from basketball after tearing her ACL 5 times, and another who had to retire from volleyball because of ongoing knee problems 

Jontay already wasn‚Äôt that great of an athlete, so after these knee injuries most people are guessing that the little mobility he had to begin with has been completely sapped 

So why is he the perfect fit for us? 



REASON 1: 2nd round picks don‚Äôt matter, there‚Äôs no real risk for us. Garpax literally sell them off, there‚Äôs a pretty good chance they‚Äôll sell this one off too. The ones we actually have kept have all flopped too 

We took Paul Zipser in 2016, out the NBA now 

Cameron Bairstow in 2014, out of the NBA now

Erik Murphy in 2013, out of the NBA now 

The list goes on and on, 2nd rounds picks basically never work out, so we‚Äôre (probably) not missing out on anything even if Jontay is never healthy 





REASON 2: Nikola Jokic‚Äòs success in this year‚Äôs playoffs are showing that a skilled big can be successful even with athletic limitations. Jokic is probably stronger than Jontay and he has a longer wingspan so I‚Äôm not saying Jontay is the next Jokic, but he‚Äôs a real, skilled perimeter player that can shoot, pass, and dribble at a really high level for a 6‚Äô11 guy.

He shot 36% from 3 and 75% from the line, and his jumpshot is the most guard-like of any big I‚Äôve ever seen (aside from KD, but you know what I mean)

"If we don‚Äôt get the 1/2 pick and Ja is off the table draft/trade/FA PG prospects dry up rather immediately. With a starting 2-5 in place, how many years do we want to go without a capable facilitating PG who can also put up points when necessary? 

DLo is the young high level prospect on the market. His 21/4/7 bettered his career average by 2 assists and 5 points, and all of his shooting percentages have gone up with his usage. 

His marijuana bust and the Nets overloaded guard situation may make him less attractive to them (especially if they‚Äôre going after other max players), and his first time playoff numbers 19/3.6/3.6 may scare off any max offers, which could make a Chicago deal more possible. 

Looking at our cap we could pay DLo 20-25m/yr and still be ready to pay Lauri in 2021.

"Aight so I was thinking how would we be able to absolutely nail the draft with our first round pick and assets. In this case, it only works if **we win the lottery** and are given the #1 pick by daddy Silver and the **Hawks pick stays at #5**. Here goes:
***

**Step 1**: *Draft Zion Williamson*. No brainer, however this now causes Wendell to lose his starting front court spot. The tandem of Lauri and Zion is the way to go. Wendell is now expendable.
***

**Step 2**: *Trade WCJr for the Hawks pick*. Call the Atlanta Hawks, gauge their interest in Wendell Carter Jr. At the #5 pick, the best remaining prospects are Garland, Reddish, Hunter, Culver, Bol Bol, Hayes, etc. Why do they accept? The Hawks already have their PG of the future and the remaining prospects are either risky or don't fit with what they're building. Wendell is the perfect modern versatile C that they need to help that team defensively. Wendell is also from Atlanta, GA and the Hawks GM might see a resemblance between Wendell and Draymond. Let's assume that the Hawks value Wendell over the remaining prospects at #5 and don't want to use the Mavs pick to move up, and we send out Wendell Carter Jr. to the Hawks for the #5 pick. 
***

**Step 3**: *Select Darius Garland with the #5 overall pick*. In my estimation, Garland is the BPA and has tremendous upside as a scoring point guard in the NBA. The shot and handles are about as good as you can ask for from a college freshman prospect. He was the #1 ranked PG in the class coming into the season and his season was cut short, averaging 20pts/3.3ast/4.8reb and shooting (11/23) or 48% from 3pt range in his four full college games. A PG in the mold of a damian lillard, steph curry, and jamal murray is the ideal prospect for today's NBA. Workouts and a check on his medicals will be important to solidify his merit for the #5 overall selection. This is our PG of the future. 
***

**Step 4**: *Select a Wing/Frontcourt player with the 2nd round pick*. After settling our starting lineup (Garland, LaVine, OPJ, Zion, Lauri) with our first two picks, we now focus on our bench needs. Given the extensive talks that the FO is going to try and bring in a veteran point guard for the bench, I don't think we need to address this position with the 2nd round pick, especially since we took Garland. My selection here would be either Chuma Okeke (a do it all big from Auburn), Dylan Windler (excellent wing shooter), or Admiral Schofield. I think the biggest need skillwise is 3PT shooting for our bench, so my preference would be Windler but either of these guys would be fine.
***

**RECAP**: At the conclusion of Draft night 2019, we walk away with Zion, Garland, and a bench shooter, while trading away Wendell Carter Jr. We fill our positional needs while taking the BPA both times, acquire two extremely high potential players (MVP type potential), and create depth to our bench. I know many of us love Wendell's skillset and project him to be an excellent modern big for us, but few to none of us can argue that he's a better player than Zion or Lauri. Those are the two that you keep and build around, and then we are still able to answer the PG of the future question. 

***
How would you guys rate this scenario? Is this a good trade, or should we stand pat with Wendell even if we land Zion? Could you see GarPax making a power-move like this?","Home-run Draft Scenario?

**Step 4**: *Select a Wing/Frontcourt player with the 2nd round pick*. After settling our starting lineup (Garland, LaVine, OPJ, Zion, Lauri) with our first two picks, we now focus on our bench needs. Given the extensive talks that the FO is going to try and bring in a veteran point guard for the bench, I don't think we need to address this position with the 2nd round pick, especially since we took Garland. My selection here would be either Chuma Okeke (a do it all big from Auburn), Dylan Windler (excellent wing shooter), or Admiral Schofield. I think the biggest need skillwise is 3PT shooting for our bench, so my preference would be Windler but either of these guys would be fine.
***

**RECAP**: At the conclusion of Draft night 2019, we walk away with Zion, Garland, and a bench shooter, while trading away Wendell Carter Jr. We fill our positional needs while taking the BPA both times, acquire two extremely high potential players (MVP type potential), and create depth to our bench. I know many of us love Wendell's skillset and project him to be an excellent modern big for us, but few to none of us can argue that he's a better player than Zion or Lauri. Those are the two that you keep and build around, and then we are still able to answer the PG of the future question. 

***
How would you guys rate this scenario? Is this a good trade, or should we stand pat with Wendell even if we land Zion? Could you see GarPax making a power-move like this?",43,0,Home-run Draft Scenario?,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/bi296n/homerun_draft_scenario/

"Draymond Green recently made headlines claiming there was a difference between ""82 game players"" and ""16 game players,"" referencing the fact that some guys just are not as effective in the post-season for one reason or another. He's on to something, as it's been pretty clear for the majority of the NBA's lifetime that the playoffs are a completely different game than the regular season. The pace is lower, defenses get more physical, rotations are shortened, the midrange is suddenly important, bad defenders get exposed, and fouls are called less often. Most importantly, however, is the tendency for good teams to go small more often than they do in the regular season, outing the role of the traditional center.

**So, what good is a center in the playoffs of today's NBA?**

Short answer: it really depends, and it has a lot to do with skillsets on both ends of the court. To get an idea of where I'm coming from, here's a simple chart of some vague center archetypes. Generally, the closer you are to the top-left box, the more playable in the playoffs you are.

||Can Guard Cs and Switch|Can only Guard Cs|Can only Guard Cs Occasionally|
:-:|:--|:--|:--|
|**Offensive Star**|Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo|Joel Embiid, LaMarcus Aldridge|Nikola Jokic, Nikola Vucevic, Karl-Anthony Towns|
|**Offensive Creator**|Al Horford, Jaren Jackson|Marc Gasol, Brook Lopez, Derrick Favors, Jusuf Nurkic|DeMarcus Cousins, DeAndre Ayton, Enes Kanter|
|**Offensively Dependent on Guards**|Myles Turner, Zach Collins, Mitchell Robinson|Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, Steven Adams, DeAndre Jordan|Andre Drummond, Jarrett Allen, Willie Cauley-Stein|

So, we have some categories of centers that range in their exploitability. How do playoff teams exploit each given type?

**Strategy 1: Relentlessly attack bad defenders** 

*Case study: Andre Drummond vs. Milwaukee*

This should seem pretty obvious, because it is. Centers are the focal point of almost every major defensive scheme, and they are hands down the most important defensive position in the NBA. As the saying goes, guards defend guards, forwards defend forwards, and centers defend everybody. In the case that two teams have traditional centers, the worse of the two defensively is going to get targeted, whether it's by post-ups or by a high volume of drives.

The case study here is Coach Bud's brutalization of Andre Drummond and Thon Maker in the Bucks' 4-0 sweep over Detroit. Listen, I'm not gonna stand here and say guarding Giannis is easy - but that's not all they were up against. Bledsoe and Hill were on a mission to attack the rim any chance they got. The Bucks generally tried to create looks at the rim more often than the 3pt line when Giannis was off the floor. Even though Andre is gigantic and Thon is a twig, the rim protection was just absolutely fucking terrible, and in the end Andre posted the worst NBA playoff series +/- in history with a -97. You can pretty much live at the rim if you have to stay with big lineups and can't protect the basket.

**Strategy 2: Go small and play good (but slow) defenders off the floor**

*Case study: Rudy Gobert vs. Houston*

The greatest paradox in the NBA is that the (maybe) best defender in the NBA is completely useless in the playoffs. Rudy is a shot-blocking god that is one of the best rim protectors the game has ever seen. When he's on the floor, it can stifle offenses from getting any decent look at the rim. But that's the thing - this is only a threat when he's playing.

Gobert has the unfortunate combination of a huge, hulking frame, slow feet, and long arms that take a long time to move into position from a standstill. Houston has made a living against Gobert in two straight series now by just not playing a center at all, making it more difficult for Rudy to have an impact on the defense. He's usually stretched out to the corner to defend somebody like PJ Tucker, removing his biggest asset as a rim protector because mathematically it's impossible to justify leaving a decent shooter open from 3. 

Conversely, you might think that it goes both ways: Rudy is 7'1, 270lbs. Why doesn't he just go at PJ to provoke Houston to put in another true C? Well...

**Strategy 3: Force guard-dependent bigs to create by providing fake opportunity**

*Case study: Steven Adams vs. Portland*

Because of the NBA's obsession with defense-first centers, it's not surprising to hear that many starting centers struggle to create really any sort of offense for themselves. However, there are some fringe cases where usually guard-dependent centers have a bit of skill in the post and his team wants to exploit a mismatch on the other side. This is a bit of a Trojan horse by the defense, in some cases.

In addition to the above scenario of Rudy posting up a smallball C, Steven Adams has been put into many creation scenarios against his former teammate Enes Kanter because of Kanter's reputation as a poor defender. The logic is simple: you trust your center to take advantage of a weakness in the defense. But Adams is not a star offensive player - he only averages .82 PPP per post-up, a number one full standard deviation below average. What the defense is doing is permitting a low-efficiency shot profile in the hopes that a more efficient offense going the other way will outweigh the calculated losses. Even if Adams goes at Enes over 10 straight possessions, Portland takes so many threes that it's more likely they outscore OKC over that stretch. Centers without creation instincts are played off of the floor against good teams.

**Okay, cool. Now what does this have to do with Wendell?**

Simply put, he prospectively falls into the same box as Al Horford and Jaren Jackson in that chart way back up there. The general theory of Wendell Carter's ceiling is inexploitable in any of these three ways.

1. He cannot be outright attacked because he is strong, lengthy, [and an already incredible defender that shows poise that most bigs don't display until much later in their careers](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/9xdwfs/the_athletic_how_wendell_carter_jr_has_become_a/). There are a couple exceptions in terms of matchups, namely with those ""Offensive Star"" tier guys from above, but underestimating Carter is how you get ""he's longer than you think"" moments like the first Denver game of the season. He is not a twitchy jump-for-every-block guy and that's why he's so good. Seriously, read that article if you can it's amazing.

2. He has shown major potential in switching out to smaller players (for small stretches). His inability to switch was the biggest problem and criticism of his game coming into the draft, but those worries were quickly found to be just that. He has very light feet and actively develops his defense on smaller players in his summer routines. Wendell [contested 8 3PAs per game his rookie season in just 25 MPG.](https://stats.nba.com/players/opponent-shooting/?Season=2018-19&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&sort=Left%20Corner%203%20FG%20PCT&dir=1&CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*carter) If that number extrapolates up to a full-time starting role of around 32-36 MPG, he should vault into the top 5 for all Cs. That's huge, because it indicates that he is willing and able to defend anyone he gets a chance to.

3. He prospectively will be able to capitalize on mismatches and poor defenders. I'll be honest, Wendell has not created in the post at an NBA level yet in his young career, averaging only .65 PPP there. That said, his undersizedness actually helps him in a hypothetical playoff scenario, as he's faster than the statue guys while still stronger than the beanpoles and skilled enough to create in the post against athletic fellas. He's also a decent jumpshooter from 10-16 and has a WIP runner package that shows a lot of touch.  He is already boasting an expected value per shot at the rim (a catch-all metric that includes paint-specific FG%, FGAs, FT rate, and FT%) higher than Nikola Jokic, Brook Lopez, Hassan Whiteside, and Andre Drummond. And jesus, hopefully we get some push from Jimbo to let him rip that three sometime soon. His mechanics look really good ([and as a reminder, he shot 41% from 3 at Duke](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/wendell-carterjr-1.html) ).

In conclusion, it's gonna be really cool to see how he progresses and see if he really can become that player. Right now, he is the most modern Bulls prospect by a goddamn landslide, and if he shows his mettle in our inevitable first playoff appearance with this core, we'll know we have something special.

**TL;DR: Wendell Carter does not fall into any of the three major problem areas of exploitation that centers face in modern NBA playoff environments. This makes him extremely fucking valuable and we should be excited for his return, even if his regular season performance is not what we hope or expect. His skillset is rare and has a specific usefulness in the postseason.... hypothetically.**","[OC?] The playoff failures of Rudy Gobert, Andre Drummond, and Steven Adams prove why you should be excited about Wendell Carter, Jr. Draymond Green recently made headlines claiming there was a difference between ""82 game players"" and ""16 game players,"" referencing the fact that some guys just are not as effective in the post-season for one reason or another.

That said, his undersizedness actually helps him in a hypothetical playoff scenario, as he's faster than the statue guys while still stronger than the beanpoles and skilled enough to create in the post against athletic fellas. He's also a decent jumpshooter from 10-16 and has a WIP runner package that shows a lot of touch.  He is already boasting an expected value per shot at the rim (a catch-all metric that includes paint-specific FG%, FGAs, FT rate, and FT%) higher than Nikola Jokic, Brook Lopez, Hassan Whiteside, and Andre Drummond. And jesus, hopefully we get some push from Jimbo to let him rip that three sometime soon. His mechanics look really good ([and as a reminder, he shot 41% from 3 at Duke](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/wendell-carterjr-1.html) ).

In conclusion, it's gonna be really cool to see how he progresses and see if he really can become that player. Right now, he is the most modern Bulls prospect by a goddamn landslide, and if he shows his mettle in our inevitable first playoff appearance with this core, we'll know we have something special.

**TL;DR: Wendell Carter does not fall into any of the three major problem areas of exploitation that centers face in modern NBA playoff environments. This makes him extremely fucking valuable and we should be excited for his return, even if his regular season performance is not what we hope or expect. His skillset is rare and has a specific usefulness in the postseason.... hypothetically.**",21,151,"[OC?] The playoff failures of Rudy Gobert, Andre Drummond, and Steven Adams prove why you should be excited about Wendell Carter, Jr.",https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/bgnhda/oc_the_playoff_failures_of_rudy_gobert_andre/

"Assuming that all things remain the same - Bulls end up with the 4th pick and Cleveland ends up with the second pick - Do you think the Bulls should try and trade up to the second spot? 

Ja Morant is obviously second best prospect in the draft behind Zion. But, the Cavs just got their PG in last year's draft in Colin Sexton. On the surface, it would make sense for them to trade down 2 spots and gain either a player or additional draft capital in exchange for the 4th pick. In reality however, every team will likely take the BPA, and the Cavs will look to stack their back court.

"In summer of 2017 the Bucks hired Jon Horst as their GM and he, along with the newer ownership talked about creating a Championship culture based only on creating a winner that could take it all.  They also publicly promised no more seasons of ""constant rebuilding"".   

A Now here we are  and the Bucks look to be one of the most dangerous teams in the Playoffs.  They went from nothing to elite in a season!  

All the stuff written about Jon Horst being an incredible Basketball mind, coupled with the new owners who vowed to make the Bucks a ""dynasty team"" like the Green Bay Packers have been seemed like a joke back then.  But they put forth the money and the effort to make the team ""the best"". Most of us rolled our eyes and laughed a little. Like we hadn't heard that line before! 

Now? Nobody is laughing. 

The Bulls said basically the same thing in 2015 when they fired Thibs and hired Hoiberg.  Then they also said the basically the same thing in 2016 when they traded Rose.  Then they said the same thing yet again in summer of 2017 when they traded Butler for basically the best players we have now. )  Yet, nothing has changed. 

I fear we are going to be one of those teams that are in a ""Constant Rebuilding"" phase and either don't have the savvy or the skills to build another Championship team, let alone another  Dynasty.   How do you think we could stop this merry-go-round of draft picks, trades, coaching hires, and a glaring lack of attracting fee agents?

I know most everyone here has full faith in Paxson but I am quickly losing faith in his skills as a Front Office leader.  Gar Forman may be able to draft well, but at the same time drafting both Noah and Rose were no-brainers.  Butler was a great pick I will admit. But he wanted out of here as soon as Thibs was gone and he never got along with our F.O. or Hoiberg.  

How can we build a winner instead of the constant unfulfilled promises we get from Paxson and Forman?  Is Boylen going to be the coach to create a winner or are we in for a three year rebuilding phase and the FO knows it.   Maybe signing Boylen to three more seasons in addition to the one remaining on his contract is a signal the FO thinks this will take at least four years?  

Now we have starters but literally no bench. One injury to one player ruins weeks and weeks of games because we have nobody to come in and pick up slack.  You cannot win that way. 

Sorry I guess I am just venting because here it is again, playoff season and nothing to et excited about concerning the Bulls.  We got the annual talk from Paxson about being in the hunt and how we are rebuilding and it takes time.  Yet we almost never see any results.  It sucks and I am getting a little fed up with it.

"I know we all would love to see him in a Bulls uniform again but I highly doubt that will happen.  He could get more money elsewhere with better teams who need some talent at PG and who are already in the hunt or really close.  

Plus, Paxson has a strong history of not pursuing past players.  Rose was a part of the ""Thibs team"" that fought with the front office before the team was broken apart and Thibs had total loyalty of his players and very little loyalty to GarPax which was obvious for a while. 

The teams I feel will be in the hunt for Rose this off season are: 

&#x200B;

The Spurs- Watch them try to deal to get Tres Jones in the draft and sign a vet like Rose. It was no secret they have been interested in Rose since he started playing well in Minnesota.  Rose might be tempted to go there because the Spurs are probably the best run Franchise in the NBA for nearly twenty years and are always in the running for the ring.  Here he could get into a Championship series quickly. 

&#x200B;

The Celtics- They will be trying to get both younger and older talent in this position and they have the cash to pay for it.  They are never that far off from going deep in the playoffs.   They were also very impressed with Rose during the season with Minnesota. Plus there is a huge chance Kyrie Irving will be moving on. 

&#x200B;

Denver Nuggets- They will be looking to beef up at Point Guard. Both in starting & off he bench as well as Getting young talent through the draft and vets through free agency.  Rose would be a perfect fit especially if Isaiah Thomas moves on as he is rumored to. 

&#x200B;

Indiana Pacers- Victor Olapdio will definitely need an experienced back up vet. That has been proven and the rumor mill in Indie is that they are seriously considering a vet like Rose.  The fact that he has practiced at the Pacers Facility and his close friendship with Myles Turner help to fuel the rumor mill. 

&#x200B;

Miami Heat- Look for them to draft a Point Guard and sign one or more vets to play behind him and mentor.  They also have the money and are willing to spend it. 

&#x200B;

Timberwolves- They will be losing a ton of players to free agency this season so it is difficult to determine which position they will concentrate on for rebuilding.  However they seem to be in love with Derrick Rose and his loyalty. Not to mention Rose seems to be very comfortable and happy playing there.  Its just a matter of making a deal which is a very probable possibility. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, where do you think he will wind up?","Where do you predict Derrick Rose will wind up after this Free Agent season? I know we all would love to see him in a Bulls uniform again but I highly doubt that will happen.  He could get more money elsewhere with better teams who need some talent at PG and who are already in the hunt or really close.  

Plus, Paxson has a strong history of not pursuing past players.  Rose was a part of the ""Thibs team"" that fought with the front office before the team was broken apart and Thibs had total loyalty of his players and very little loyalty to GarPax which was obvious for a while. 

The teams I feel will be in the hunt for Rose this off season are: 

&#x200B;

The Spurs- Watch them try to deal to get Tres Jones in the draft and sign a vet like Rose. It was no secret they have been interested in Rose since he started playing well in Minnesota.  Rose might be tempted to go there because the Spurs are probably the best run Franchise in the NBA for nearly twenty years and are always in the running for the ring.  Here he could get into a Championship series quickly. 

&#x200B;

The Celtics- They will be trying to get both younger and older talent in this position and they have the cash to pay for it.  They are never that far off from going deep in the playoffs.   They were also very impressed with Rose during the season with Minnesota. Plus there is a huge chance Kyrie Irving will be moving on. 

&#x200B;

Denver Nuggets- They will be looking to beef up at Point Guard. Both in starting & off he bench as well as Getting young talent through the draft and vets through free agency.  Rose would be a perfect fit especially if Isaiah Thomas moves on as he is rumored to.

"Yes, I know it's still early since we're still in round 1 of the playoffs, and the lottery hasn't even happened yet, but here's what I'd try to do if I were GarPax:

First off, using  [https://www.spotrac.com/nba/chicago-bulls/cap/2019/](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/chicago-bulls/cap/2019/)  the Bulls without including FA cap-holds have \~$24 million in cap space. I'll take about $6 million of this for rookie purposes, so we're at $18 million. Not much, but we can work with it, and we still have exceptions.

In the draft, this is what I'd go for:

If we get pick #1: Zion of course

\#2: Ja Morant

\#3: RJ Barrett

\#4: Jarrett Culver

\#5: Culver, Reddish, Hunter, Garland, or White

Since we are 4th from the bottom, I'll just go with Culver for the sake of this simulation. And with our 2nd round pick, #39, I'd go for Jalen McDaniels would be a guy I like. Other prospects for that pick include Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Cameron Johnson, Lugentz Dort, Eric Paschall, Louis King, etc. (If we get Zion, then a 3 and D wing here. If we get Culver or Barrett or Ja, then a PF here)

BTW, I think that of those possibilities for our first pick, only Ja or Garland really makes a big difference to me in how we approach our free agent targets because then we don't focus as much on multiple point guards. But that's for a different conversation.

&#x200B;

Now, our roster would look something like this, with salaries:

Otto Porter, $27.25 million

Zach LaVine, $19.5 million

Christiano Felicio, $8.1 million

Kris Dunn, 2-year Team Option, $5.35 million

Lauri Markkanen, 2-year team option, $5.3 million

Wendell Carter, $5.2 million

Jarrett Culver/1st round  rookie, $5 million

Denzel Valentine, 2-year club option, $3.37 million

Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, team option, $2.5 million

Chandler Hutchinson, $2.3 million

Antonio Blakeney, $1.58 million

Shaq Harrison, non-guaranteed $1.5 million

Jalen McDaniels/2nd round pick, $1 million

Expect the Bulls to pick up all those options except for TLC, which would free up $2.5 million in cap space, putting us at $20.5 million

Also waive and stretch Felicio, so his cap hit each of the next 5 years is $3 million, saves us $5.1 million this year, at $25.6 million in cap space now

And last for this time, trade Dunn. I'm not so sure what we can get for him, but I think it's time we moved on. Shop him and get something of value for him. I'll revisit this topic of what we can get for him in the future.  Cap Space $31 million

(We could consider keeping him too but again another conversation when we actually get deeper into the offseason)

Our free agents:

Robin Lopez

Ryan Arch (RFA)

Wayne Selden (RFA)

Walter Lemon Jr. (RFA)

Rawle Alkins (2-way)

I think we'll resign Lopez to a deal at about 1 year $4 million (with bird rights)

Also, I think Selden will walk, but we'll keep Arch and Lemon. (Lemon might end up either back on a 2-way deal or G League contract, but he'll be in camp, same with Alkins)

We won't count their salaries against the cap, due to their bird rights and restricted Free agency. But none of them cost above $1.8 million

&#x200B;

Now, to free agency.

Some targets at each position:

PG: Derrick Rose

Patrick Beverly

Ricky Rubio

Malcolm Brogdon

Terry Rozier

&#x200B;

SG: Terrence Ross

Danny Green

Tomas Satoranksy

Jeremy Lamb

Tyreke Evans

&#x200B;

SF: Trevor Ariza

Rudy Gay

Bojan Bogdanovic

&#x200B;

PF: Thaddeus Young

Marvin Williams

Taj Gibson

Marcus Morris

Al-Farouq Aminu

&#x200B;

C: Brook Lopez

Julius Randle (PF)

Enes Kanter

Ed Davis

There are some other guys I didn't list, but here's who I'd sign

Derrick Rose, 3 years, $25 million total

Patrick Beverly, 2 years, $15 million, player option

Terrence Ross, 1 year, $8 million

Al-Farouq Aminu 1 year $6 million

Roster: PG Rose, Beverly, Arch, Harrison/Lemon

SG: LaVine, Culver, Ross, Blakeney,

SF: Porter, Hutchinson, Valentine,

C: Carter, Lopez

2-way players/G leaguers:

"Hello fellow bulls fans. Let me start this post by saying that as the season progressed I started having more confidence on Boylen and I do think he earned the chance to coach the team for an entire season.
THAT SAID I was thinking that with the idea that no really good option was on the table for us.
Today multiple insider are reporting that the Kings in the most ""kings"" way possible could be on the verge of firing Joerger?
So I wanted to ask: What do you all think about him as our next coach? 
To me he seems like the right kind of coach for this team, have you seen the fast pace offense the kings played all year long? It could do wonderful for our young guys! Also Joerger coached in Memphis before so he knows how to make it work with 2 7 foot on the defensive and offensive end.

"So we ended this season with 4 point guards: Kris Dunn, Shaq Harrison, Ryan Arch, aNd Walter Lemon Jr. The latter 2 in Lemon and Arch are free agents, Shaq‚Äôs contract is not fully guaranteed, and Dunn has been the subject of trade rumors. In the draft we may be in a position to select any of Ja Morant, Coby White, or Darius Garland. In free agency, a number of veteran options are available, like Kemba Walker (dream)  Derrick Rose, Malcolm Brogdon, Ricky Rubio, Terry Rozier, and Darren Collison. What do you think we should do? 

To me, if we end up not picking second aka not getting Ja, then unless we somehow fell to 7 and I‚Äôd then maybe be ok with White, we should pick any of the other top guys. Win the lottery, pick Zion. Pick 3rd, get RJ if Ja is gone. 4th, then Culver. Then I‚Äôd keep Lemon and Shaq (sorry Arch), gauge the trade market for Dunn if we can get a different solid po by guard (tho I‚Äôd be open to keeping him) and then sign one of the veterans like Rose or Rozier or Brogdon. 

If we got Ja, or fell to 7th and picked White (hopefully we win the lottery, also I don‚Äôt want us to get Garland) then I‚Äôd trade Dunn for whatever I can get and sign one of those point guards but to a cheaper deal maybe Rose or Rubio or Collison would take and have them be the 6th man.

"We all know Dunn can play good defense. Lock down defense on the opponents star? Time will tell. 

But his offensive game is lackluster, still, after all these years. At first he tried to shoot the 3 ball but he simply can't. This past year he's tried more of a DeMar Derozen -DWade type lane game. 

He's gotten better but he's still a PG that needs the ball to be effective. I don't see him run the offense well or run fast breaks well. He's not a play maker and not a scorer and not a floor spacer. So, on offense, what kind of player is he? What's his identity out there and what is his role? I think if he answers these questions his future in this league will become more apparent. If he doesn't, he'll see his stock fall and he'll struggle to get another contract. 

I expect Dunn to be dealt this offseason or by Christmas next season. He's a bench guy on a good team but once again, what role does he fill and how does he contribute?","This summer Kris Dunn must choose what kind of PG he is. We all know Dunn can play good defense.

"Hi - I'm interested in hearing from past and current Bulls season ticket holders about their opinions and experiences. I know this topic has been posted before, but as the dynamic/quality of a sports team changes, I imagine being a season ticket holder follows suit.

&#x200B;

My situation: looking to purchase 2 club level Bulls season tickets for the upcoming season. I'll go to maybe 5-10 games a season and sell the rest. I'd like to be a season ticket holder because I enjoy watching the Bulls, but I'm more loyal to my bank account and believe that, should the Bulls pick up steam, demand will rise. Specifically, I'm interested in the 200-level seats shaded in dark blue ($116/ticket): [https://www.nba.com/.element/media/2.0/teamsites/bulls/docs/diagrams/seatmap1819\_pricing\_180801.pdf](https://www.nba.com/.element/media/2.0/teamsites/bulls/docs/diagrams/seatmap1819_pricing_180801.pdf)

&#x200B;

Question 1: Financially, what can I expect out of this 'investment'? Say I wanted to only go to a few games, can I expect to break even or better?

&#x200B;

Question 2: How much work is involved with being a season ticket holder and reselling tickets? Has the proliferation of ticket resale sites made the process easy, or am I going to have a constant headache trying to offload unwanted tickets?

&#x200B;

Any other opinions/experiences/advice is welcome - looking to gauge if I this is a worthwhile use of my time and money. Thanks in advance.","Season Ticket Holders: Worth it?

"With all of the posts about Garland v. Culver and what we'll do if we miss on the top three in this draft I was trying to think of trades that might be interesting where we can move down into the 8-12 range and still have a reasonable shot at Garland. 

The one team that stuck out to me as a really interesting trade partner was NOLA:

**We get: Jrue Holiday, NOLA 1st round (#9)**

**Pelicans get: #4 pick + their choice of Dunn/Valentine/Hutchison (as many as they want) + reasonably protected future first**

That protected future first is something that I assume needs to be in there to get it done, but I'd want the protections to be minimum top 10 in the first year, and top 4 the following. With Jrue as out point guard you probably expect this pick to be somewhere in the 15-20 range so it probably conveys right away and the protections are just there for if catastrophe hits. 

**Why the Pelicans do it:** because I think the trade market for someone like Jrue is going to be soft. He won't change the trajectory of a franchise, but he's too talented to give away for nothing. If they can turn him into a high upside, but potentially long term project then I think it's in their long term interests. I'm also assuming that they're able to turn Davis into some promising assets geared towards a proper rebuild and not a retooling. If they trade him for people who can currently play then I think the price would be higher than we'd be willing to pay.  I don't think that'd be a smart path for them, but it's hard to know what their plans are at this stage. 

Maybe I'm underestimating what they'd need to trade him, but trying to think of a team that would offer something that compelling for Jrue and there's essentially no chance that they're competing for anything over the next few years while they've got him in his prime. They'll probably be looking to sell high and I've got to imagine that this is it. 

**Why we do it:** I really like the fit next to LaVine in the backcourt. Both can playmake (Jrue is better),  and both are comfortable off ball. His shooting isn't perfect, but he's not horrible at it and I think he'd get a lot more open looks in our offense than he has at any time in his career so I'd expect his three point shooting to be on the plus side of what he's had in the past. We still get to go for a lottery ticket type of player at the #9 pick. If Garland is there (I think a distinct possibility) then we can take him without having to worry about his short term ability. Given how much time he's missed I'm guessing he's not ready to start, or maybe even play a serious bench role, on day one. Otherwise we can go with Coby White or a non-point guard best player available since our starting roster wouldn't have any glaring holes.  

We'd be an eastern conference playoff lock and I think there's a decent chance we'd be in the mix with the Pacers (assuming they bring everyone back) for the 5th best in the conference, 4th if Kawhi leaves Toronto.

Personally I'd give this trade a look even if we're at #3 and Morant is off the board. If that's the case I'm not giving up the protected pick (Barrett's upside is just a tier above whoever they might like at #4). 

EDIT: It's possible I was under pricing Jrue, though I'm not 100% sold that's true. Would you be interested in this if we loosened the protections on our future first (just 1-4 for two years), and didn't take back their pick? I think it still makes some sense to us and at that point is almost certainly the best offer they're going to get (maybe you disagree, and I'd love to hear who you see going hard after him).

"We are currently 3 games back of Cleveland for the 3rd seed, will 3 games left to go.  I'd say the odds of us going 0-3 *and* Cleveland going 3-0 *and* winning the coin flip are essentially nil.  

So, with the new lottery odds coming into play for this year's draft, let's take a look at our odds for where we end up come draft time.

**8th pick in the draft:  2.2%**

The furthest we could fall in the draft is back to the 8th slot, which would happen if and only if 4 teams from the 5th through 14th seeds jump us into the top 4.  At 2.2%, this is very unlikely to happen, and represents our lowest odds.  This, suffice it so say, would be the catastrophic outcome.

**7th pick in the draft:  16.7%**

Because of the new and favorable odds for lower ranked teams, we are actually more likely to fall in the draft than we are to remain at 4th or move up, combined.  This is our second more likely landing spot, followed by...

**6th pick in the draft:  25.7%**

Far and away our most probably landing spot is 6th in the draft, at almost 1.5 times as likely as our second most probably, the 7th seed.  Ironically, this most probably is placed next to our least probable (ignoring that 2.2% chance)...

**5th pick int he draft:  7.2%**

Because of the way the seeding works, and given the limit on how far the top three seeds can fall, falling back 1 pick is our least likely scenario, barring the catastrophic possibility outlined above.

**4th pick in the draft:  11.5%**--staying where we are

The good news is, that percentage won't fall again.  Staying put is our third least likely scenario, though still very much in play.  This is also, generally speaking, considered the drop off point where the talent in this year's draft begins to fall off (though take those predictions with a grain of salt as always).

**3rd pick in the draft:  11.9%**

Our odds of getting the top 4 picks are almost identical to each other, and we're not into the territory where we must rely on hopping someone else, rather than hoping no one hops us.

**2nd pick in the draft:  12.2%**

Those odds just keep increasing as we inch towards number 1.  And finally:

**1st pick in the draft:  12.5%**

Our third most likely scenario is in fact nabbing that 1st slot, though the odds can never really be said to be in our favor.  Our odds of 1st through 4th are essentially identical to one another.

Now, looking at the bigger picture, what exactly does this mean?

Well, our odds of moving back rather than staying put or moving up are essentially identical:  we have a 51.8% chance of falling, and a 48.2% chance of nabbing one of the 1 through 4 picks.

However, if we divide this into sections rather than halves, then easily our most likely landing spot is in the 6 to 7 range, where we have a whopping 42.4% chance of landing, which takes up 81.8% of our odds of falling back.  If we can avoid that, we'll be in excellent shape.  If not, well...the 30 for 30 doc on the Triple 7s when we win a ring will be excellent.","If Cleveland loses to Golden State tonight, we will officially be locked into the 4th seed for the lottery draw.

Bulls trainers kept walking right past me as I was talking to them trying to get their attention which absolutely sucked like c‚Äômon at least recognize me lol. 

But after the game as I was recording the final seconds, just for my own sake and as I was putting my phone away not looking something was thrown at me, and as I looked up I caught a glance of it as it bounced back onto the floor by the bench and one of the security grabbed it and handed it to me... and it was sweaty red arm band so I‚Äôm guessing one of our guys so me standing and decided to give me a souvenir.. but I‚Äôm trying to figure out who it could have been because I can‚Äôt recall anyone wearing the arm band during the game and didn‚Äôt see anyone throw it, neither did my friend.. so it was kinda weird..

"Hi all,

Trying to get back into basketball and the bulls. I have barely paid attention since 1999 (I was 8 years old) which is when my family left chicago and the U.S. I kept up with my love of baseball and the cubs but haven't really followed basketball other than checking finals winners and hearing about Derrick Rose being a thing for a few years. 

Recently an espn basketball highlight video popped up on my Facebook feed and I watched it and now I'm seeing awesome clips every day haha. Thats whats gotten me interested. Seen this guy Zion he's a machine, I understand the bulls have a chance of getting him? Do the bulls have a shot at any big free agents? I understand that NBA free agency is a lot of fun these days....any other tips for a guy trying to get back into the bulls and nba? Any tips on watching games from Europe? 

Thanks!

"Buckle up guys and gals. Today is likely the last chance the Bulls have to make a move for the third seed. If they are going to grab ahold of that +1.5% and a guarantee to drop no further than 7th (we sure do love that seventh pick) the bulls are going to really have to try not to try tonight and hope Devin Booker can keep on carrying his team just far enough to not win a game.

The Bulls are two games back of the Cavs for the 3rd seed in the draft lottery. Since the Bulls pulled off three oh so important development wins over the Cavs this season, they will need to fully jump them in the loss rankings to get those coveted bottom three odds\*. This means the Bulls have to lose to the Knicks twice, and the Cavs have to beat three of the following teams: the Suns, the Kings, The Warriors, the Spurs and the Hornets.

Im not sure which part is more difficult, the Bulls losing to the Knicks twice or the Cavs winning 3 of 5, but its not out of the question. The Bulls have a good chunk of their contracts on that Anthony Scarramucci timeframe, and the Cavs have been playing ok enough to win 2 of their last 7, so maybe they're due for a winning streak? So lets hope for some development wins for the Knicks and Cavs, and some pre-title run rest games from the Warriors and Spurs.

None of it really matters if the Bulls or Suns win tonight, so lets hope for some good effort from them... April fools! lets hope they suck tonight and going forward.

In other news it only took me two clicks on the lottery simulator on [tankathon.com](https://tankathon.com) to get the Bulls to the land of Zion so maybe we don't need that extra 1.5...

"Man, he‚Äôs a baller and can shoot it from deep. 

Regardless of what happens with our lotto pick, we need some more (quality) guard depth on the roster. IF he‚Äôs there at the top of the second round where we will likely pick using the Grizzlies 2nd rounder, I think he‚Äôd be very much worth the shot. Huge steal.

However, since his draft stock is likely gonna rise to maybe end of the first round, should we try trading up from our second round pick into an additional first rounder on draft night? I think if we can trade Dunn + the second rounder for a late first round pick that would help us secure Carsen Edwards, we should consider it. Hopefully we work him out pre-draft.

"‚ÄúActually could be a Bull‚Äù edition. Tonight, we have some motherfucking basketball.

**LOUISIANA STATE vs MICHIGAN STATE - 6:09 CT**

* Xavier Tillman, SF/PF, MSU - late 2nd-undrafted, big dude (245lbs) who absorbs rebounds, converts at the rim and hits FTs

* Tremont Waters, PG, LSU - late 2nd-undrafted if he declares. hit a cold blooded shot against Maryland to ice it. 

* Naz Reid, PF, LSU - probably gonna go 2nd round or undrafted, but could make a roster. basically Mo Speights 

* Cassius Winston, PG, MSU - undrafted, but he can score. Probably a training camp guy

**NORTH CAROLINA vs AUBURN - 6:29 CT**

* Coby White, PG, UNC - mocked from 7-14. Lights out shooter who was born to get buvkets and not much else. Will pull up from 30 at least once tonight. 

* Nassir Little, SF/PF, UNC - mocked from 12-25, gigantic human being who might not know how to play basketball. pretty solid defensive prospect but struggles a lot on offense. kind of Stan Johnson-esque

* Cameron Johnson, SG/SF, UNC - mocked from 20-35, absolutely amazing shooter who stands tall at 6‚Äô8‚Äù. Best Cameron in the draft by a longshot, and my favorite potential use for Bulls‚Äô 2nd rounder via Memphis if he falls to us. 

* Chuma Okeke, PF, Auburn - mocked 25-40, super mobile stretch 4 who is active as hell. Pretty decent vision too. Fun to watch, has a little Siakam in his game. 

* Anfernee McLemore, PF, Auburn - mocked late 2nd-undrafted. extremely flawed stretch 4 without amazing size but has some potential as an offensive piece. 

* Bryce Brown, G, Auburn - mocked late 2nd-undrafted, probably a training camp guy. Absolutely unreal shooter on high volume. Burying tournament teams for Auburn right now, especially Kansas where he was 7/11 from deep. 

**DUKE vs VIRGINIA TECH - 8:29 CT**

* Zion Williamson, ANY POSITION, Duke - MOCKED #1 OVERALL. BEST NCAA PROSPECT SINCE ANTHONY DAVIS OR MAYBE SHAQ. WATCH HIM WHILE YOU CAN. 

* RJ Barrett, SG/SF, Duke - mocked 2-5, a bit like DeMar DeRozan, very raw at pretty much everything but he‚Äôs an amazing transition scorer and pretty good defender. Loves the midrange and not the best decision maker but he is somewhat clutch. 

* Cam Reddish, SF, Duke - mocked 3-15, easily the biggest question mark in the draft. By almost every conceivable metric has been a horrible player this season, but has good size and glimpses of NBA defensive potential and range. One of the worst finishers you will ever see in your life, shooting 40% at the rim, but will probably sink some unreal shot tonight to float his value

* Nickeil Alexander-Walker, SG/SF, VTech - mocked 10-16, literally Shai Gilgeous-Alexander‚Äôs cousin, which is a funny coincidence because they play similarly and have long ass names. Amazing vision, good looking form, long ass guard. Nobody knows what his NBA position is but he‚Äôs clearly talented. 

* Tre Jones, PG, Duke - mocked 15-30, an extremely intelligent guard who always makes the right play and harasses guards on defense. Problem is he can‚Äôt shoot at all and that really hurts Duke‚Äôs offense. Second most consistent Blue Devil after Zion. 

**KENTUCKY vs HOUSTON, 8:59 CT**

* PJ Washington, PF, UK - mocked 10-20, great defender with a huge, strong build. Great on both ends of the floor, andd at his range he could be a plug-in starter for the team that drafts him, especially the Charlottes, Miamis, and Portlands of the draft.

* Keldon Johnson, SF, UK - mocked 10-20, solid 3&D guy with good size. Got some Snell in him which I really do not like. 

* Tyler Herro, SG, UK - mocked 15-25, unbelievable shooter and creator. Propensity to go nuclear, fun to watch. Currently shooting like 95% from FT which is just insane for a college student.

* Corey Davis, Jr., G, Houston - probably a late 2nd or undrafted guy. Solid shooter who can create for himself at a high level. Able to finish through contact and generally a bucket getter.

* Armoni Brooks, G, Houston - definitely an undrafted guy, like a super poor man's Rajon Rondo with an okay 3PT shot. Really great passer that struggles offensively when he has to score, but a good complement to Davis in the backcourt.","Friday Night March Madness games, and what prospects you‚Äôll be able to see ‚ÄúActually could be a Bull‚Äù edition.

SG: Zach Lavine - Top 20 scorer, electric athlete, ability to play decent on ball D

SF: Otto Porter - Great all around player, good glue guy for the team

PF: Lauri Markkanen - The modern Dirk, limitless potential, great mobility, shooting, rebounding and improving defense

C: Wendel Carter - Defensive anchor, nice touch out to 3pt line, can jump out the gym, very young, great potential

Bench:

Kelly Oubre - 6th man, the sexiest man in the nba, explosive athlete, can be a good shooter, decent size and defender

Kris Dunn - Great playmaker for the second unit, can go off some nights, great defender, developing jump shooter

Mitchell Robinson -  future DPOY candidate, great size, rebounding, and mobility

Dewayne Dedmon - Age 29, great stretch 4, good size, rim protection, and rebounding, veteran presence

Chandler Hutchinson - Good prospect, 3 and D ability, great athleticism, can play 3 or 4, good ceiling

Denzel Valentine - Can play SF or PG, great shooting touch, good at finishing around the rim, good playmaker

Antonio Blakeney - Spark off the bench, can put up points equal to the amount of minutes he plays, great athlete

"Obviously Zion and Ja would be a wet dream and fingers crossed we land a top 2 pick but in the worst case scenario and we don't get a chance to draft them - who are some prospects we should be looking at?

Just to name a few that I can think of:

**Darius Garland:**

Pros: Shifty PG with a very smooth shot and saucy handles. Has the ability to pull up for a 3 which is a very valuable skillset for a PG in today's NBA. Reminds kinda reminds me of Kyrie (in terms of playstyle not ability)

Cons: A bit small - 6'1 or 6'2 iirc. Defensively can be a target and a backcourt consisting of him and Lavine may be the worst defensive pairings in the league. Playmaking is still a question mark (but I think he will be a solid playmaker see the pros because of his skillsets listed above). Only played 5 games in college.

**Jarrett Culver:**

Pros: Tall - 6'8* but some say he is still growing. Has the ability to create for himself, whether its slashing or scoring out of the post/midrange.  Versatile defenseively - can guard a variety of positions. Kinda reminds me of Derozan in terms of playstyle.

Cons: Although he's the primary ball-handler at Tech and has shown skills as a passer - he's not your natural PG and starting him with Lavine would be a tall-lengthy backcourt that may be missing playmaking. 3pt shot is improving but whether it will translate to the pros is a different story.

**Coby White:**

Pros: Gets buckets, whether its slashing to the basket or pulling up for a 3. Has the killer instinct - he's not afraid to take the last shot. Defensively solid. Has shown ability to become a solid playmaker. Reminds me a little of Kemba

Cons: Decision making is still a worry at times.  Shot selection is another question mark. And turnovers is a problem.

If you have anymore prospects I would love to hear! I strictly kept it with guards in my list because I feel like unless its Zion or maybe RJ - our frontcourt is set.

The Kings have flipped the narrative of their franchise on its head this year by turbocharging their offense and playing at light speed. They went from last to first in pace over the course of the last year and have one of the quickest offenses after makes, misses and turnover. Meanwhile, the Bulls are middle of the pack and generally walk the ball up, allowing the defense to set up and making life harder than it needs to be.

Like the Kings, the Bulls have a young, athletic roster and if they want to take a similar leap, they'll need to scrap the slow-down offense and re-invent themselves by maximizing their strengths and running at every chance they get.

Here is his [ESPN](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3907498/matisse-thybulle) college profile.

He is a phenomenal defender and is projected to go late in the draft. I first heard about this guy on The Ringer NBA Show podcast.

His offensive skills are shakey and is not a primary scoring option, however he can really impact the defensive end of the ball. He's [breaking Pac-12 steal records set by Jason Kidd and Gary Payton](https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/uw-husky-basketball/after-passing-jason-kidd-huskies-matisse-thybulle-closes-in-on-gary-paytons-steals-record/) and is averaging 2.3 blocks so far this season.

I think he can match this teams identity in a backup guard position, though I don't know if he's capable of developing into a starting role.

I'm a huge sports fan, huge NBA fan in particular, and am from Southwest Ohio. I am moving to Chicago for at least 6 years starting this summer! We have no NBA team in that area of Ohio and I never became a Cavs fan (the Cavs and LeBron always referred to themselves as ""Northeastern Ohio's team"" rather than ""Ohio's team"" so I always took that personal lol plus I hate Cleveland sports because I'm a diehard Cincy fan). I am a hardcore NBA fan though and the NBA has always been my favorite league. I tend to follow every team and I know of Jordan era Bulls-lore and recent Bulls history.

I'll support the Bears as an NFC team and I guess I'll root for the White Sox since I'll be in a job that works closely with residents of the Southside and don't really care about the Reds (I'm not a baseball fan). No Cubs for me. ",37,39,I'm a New Bulls Fan Pumped to Join the Community!,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/b27b0c/im_a_new_bulls_fan_pumped_to_join_the_community/

"Obviously, any free agent signings will be dependent on what happens in the draft this year, but I'm curious as to who the Bulls might pick up in FA, especially at the PG spot.

On the higher end of the scale I think it could be interesting to see either D'Angelo Russell or Kemba Walker sign with the team. 

Some cheaper options could be Ricky Rubio or Pat Beverley. Both of those guys would bring a much needed defensive presence. 

A lot of people have been throwing D Rose's name out, but I just don't see that working out as well as everyone would hope. I love D Rose, but I think there would be too many expectations, not necessarily from the fans, but from himself.

"Hey guys, I'm a massive die-hard Cubs fan, pretty big Bears fan, but I've just been a casual Bulls fan. I've followed them over the years hard during the playoffs, and casually followed them throughout the regular season, but I'm looking to get more into it. What is the status of the team right now? 

Here's my basic knowledge right now:
the Butler trade went well and we have Lauri and Lavine to build around. RoLo has looked good, and so has Otto. We should get a draft pick (probably not high enough for Zion) but it should improve the team next year, because lately they seem to be a better team than their record shows. The offense seems good, but the defense has been pretty bad lately. Also MJ is the goat and DRose coulda been another goat if it weren't for his knee exploding (RIP).
What else should I know about this team? I'd like to get more indepth. Thanks!","Casual Bulls fan here looking to get more into the NBA, what are some things I should know about the team?

I really hope we are able to draft Charles Bassey, Cameron Johnson, Shamorie Ponds or even take a chance with Luka ≈†amaniƒá... These are the ones that  caught my eye...

Bassey has high upside, and is very very young, but could be our project for the future and might be a good backup for Wendell, going forward.

Johnson is not that young, but could be interesting prospect for us. He could be a solid 3 and D player. He has solid shot, but could and should improve in the future.

Ponds is interesting player we should look at if we don't draft Morant. He is a solid shooter that could improve amd might be solid backup in the future... might be a hidden unpolished gem...

Samanic is relatively unknown because he plays in Europe. He is also a project player for the future but might develop into a good stretch PF with decent rebounding skills... and he plays PF, a position that we need a solid  backup...

"There's already been an abundant amount of posts about him not cutting it, but just for further reinforcement:

&#x200B;

Past 10 games he's played in (since Feb. 9), he's been held to single digits in points in every single game BUT the two games against the Hawks where he was guarded by the worst defender in the entire league (Young). He's also had more than 6 assists just once in those games, so he's not doing his job as a distributor either.

Obviously with the Hawks they're still up-and-coming, but it's no coincidence that teams with play-makers at the PG position are the ones who are doing the best. The Bulls as we all know DESPERATELY need to improve at the PG position this offseason, and I think the Bulls VASTLY improve next season simply by having a floor general other than Kris Dunn next year. Whether you package him in a deal or slide him to the bench,  it is imperative that he is replaced as starter if we have any hope of sneaking into the playoffs next season.

"Hey everyone! I've been thinking about the draft now that it is nearly 3 months away, and the Bulls most likely will stay at 4th in the ""reverse standings"". Chicago has a real good chance at getting a top 4 pick, and might even luck into the #1 overall pick for the first time in 11 years. With a current core of some great players (how about that game last night!), the front office will have some important decisions to make.

In my opinion, if the Bulls get the #1 pick in the draft, they should trade it for the biggest haul they can get. Whether that's trading down in this draft, or trading for established players and future picks, I think they should go for that. They could potentially gain a huge asset pool just from trading one pick because of how prized Zion Williamson is. Look, I think Zion will be a fantastic player, but as a power forward he wouldn't fit on the current Bulls team and I wouldn't want to ruin our team chemistry to make a starting spot for him. Playing Lauri at center would only make things harder for him as he would have to defend bigger guys and play out of position, why ruin what's already working so well. And I would not want to trade or bench Wendell Carter who projects to be a quality starter who compliments all of the other scorers (Porter/Lavine/Markkanen) with his defense and intangibles and shouldn't be too expensive to keep around. 

The best possible trade I could think of would be if Philladelphia flames out in the playoffs this year and would be willing to trade Ben Simmons. Embiid is clearly their number one guy and Elton Brand traded a bunch of assets to bring in Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris, and they have made it clear they want to bring both back. The MOST I think the Bulls would give up would be the #1 pick (Zion), Dunn, Valentine, Blakeney, and possibly their 2nd round pick this year. 

Sixers would be able to pay Butler and Harris and would be able to slot Zion right next to Embiid, and they would add a decent point guard to replace Simmons in Dunn who could defend and playmake and 2 more shooters for their depleted bench depth. Bulls would then have a young and amazing core of Simmons, Lavine, Porter Jr., Markkanen, Carter, Hutchinson, and then could bring in some additional guys to fill out the bench like they did in 2010 (Arcidiacono, Shaq Harrison, Lopez, maybe even Taj Gibson or Darren Collison?) It sounds crazy and unlikely and is all hypothetical, but to me it makes sense on paper for both teams and could very well happen. What do you all think?","Discussion: If Bulls luck into the #1 pick (10% chance), what would you do with it? Hey everyone!

"Bulls drop down two spots in the second round, for trading their own 2019 second pick, to land Cameron Payne. Bulls currently have Grizzlies second round pick at 36th overall, thanks to Justin ""The former tank commander and brick shooter"" Holiday.


This draft could turn out to be a weak one. There are big question marks on how the top 20 freshmens and sophomores, not named Zion Williamson, would develop in their respective teams. The drop off from Zion to the second overall pick is enourmous. This could turn out to be a Zion or bust draft. The rest of the top 20 players don't really separate themselves from one another IMO. The 21-30 picks are likely rotation players for playoff teams. 

&nbsp;

For reference I'll be using [ESPN's mock draft](http://tv5.espn.com/nba/draft/bestavailable/_/position/ovr/page/1)

- [Luka Samanic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-99QcfjCXg) PF - draft and stash pick that will likely be in the late first round or first pick in the second round. Stretch four intl player.

- [Brandon Clarke](https://www.thestepien.com/2019/01/18/draft-notes-easy-case-brandon-clarke/) PF - ESPN got him in the first round already and quite high at 19 IMO. Could already contribute to playoff teams, while developing in their system. Definitely a playoff team target. 

>‚ÄúEarly on, Clarke, then a gangly and slight-of-frame middle-schooler, regularly notched double-doubles with blocks and assists, a phenomenon Ekmark said he‚Äôs ‚Äúliterally never seen anybody else do.‚Äù

- [Matisse Thybulle](https://www.thestepien.com/2019/02/09/draft-notes-thybulle-thybulle-thybulle/) SG - My favorite player in the draft. Though he will likely bolt up in the first round, I'm thrilled if Bulls ever have a chance to draft him.

- [Jaylen Nowell](https://knicksfilmschool.com/2018/12/10/kfs-draft-watch-jaylen-nowell-through-12-9/) SG - combo guard who is underrated and under the radar. Will likely go back to college, as he is a sophomore.

- [Eric Paschall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFJsV3RYokw) SF - An athletic Draymond Green , who will likely become a better scorer than Draymond. Glue guy which is really good to have in a team. Will likely get draft in the first round or the 31st pick.

- [Robert Franks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEWs_7lIeyA) PF - Athletic combo forward with 3&D potential(Block shots and stretches the floor). It looks like he's still growing too. Could be 6'9-6'10 by now.

- [Cameron Johnson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoQQzo8vrCA) [[Offense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoQQzo8vrCA)] [[defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbFltAehSUs)] SF - The likely available pick Bulls will have at #36. A sharp shooter who can put the ball on the floor. Not athletic, too slow to defend guards and too soft to defend big guys. Comparable to Niko, but isn't as one-sided(was barely a floor spacer) as Niko when he first came in. Johnson can make plays and has point forward potential. Could be the ball handler in PnR/PnP situation.

- [Ty Jerome](https://basketballsocietyonline.com/ty-jerome-scouting-report) PG - Hello Jose Calderon. Nuff said. Hopefully he gets picked ahead of the 36th pick.

- [Darius Bazley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT4ZQPFdVn0) SF - The Mitchell Robinson of this draft. Basically a wild card whom agent Rich Paul is trying to hide from most teams, and sell to big market teams. Would be intriuging to see if GarPax would bring him in for private workouts.

- [Admiral Schofield](https://heavy.com/sports/2019/03/admiral-schofield-nba-draft-projection-stock-mock-draft/) SG - Big guard who could play SF. Think Rawle Alkins, no bigger([6‚Äô6‚Äù, 235 lbs, 5% body fat and 6‚Äô10‚Äù wingspan](https://medium.com/@asktumma/nba-draft-admiral-schofield-is-the-best-player-nobody-is-talking-about-99d9c36b2f40)) .

"Obviously we need more players. We've got two bright prospects in Lauri & Lavine. They could become the next Jordan/Pippen if our luck holds out and we get a new coaching staff. But what we really need is better players surrounding them.  The only way this is going to happen is through the draft.  

It is looking like we probably won't be getting Zion.  So, with that in mind: who else should Garpax use our picks on?  Any ideas or suggestions?

"As an NBA draft obsessive and procrastinating comp sci student, I wrote a small script that calculates what our actual odds are of drafting each individual player. **NOTE: this is NOT the odds for a given pick number, those are wildly available and would be a waste of time to recreate.***

As a preface, I want to re-iterate that this is non-scientific, as it was not done via a heavily-scrutinized NBA lottery simulator, just a simple script. It also is based on draft tendencies by Tankathon.com, obviously not indicative of a true big board for Chicago.

# The Method

I used a rough estimation of Tankathon's draft order for us and multiplied those odds against the actual odds that we land at that given position. It is important to note that I only have options here from 1-8 **because that is the only possible batch of outcomes for Chicago at the current odds.**

This is my anecdotal evidence of the built-in Tankathon big board for Chicago:

1. Zion, always

2. Morant, always, because Zion is 100% not available

3. Morant if #2 was RJ, Rj if #2 was Morant

4. Reddish if the top 3 is Zion/RJ/Ja, Morant if the top 3 is the Dukies

5. Garland, always, because the Dukies+Ja are off the board

6. Garland if Dukies/Ja/Culver are taken, Culver if Dukies/Ja/Garland are taken

7. Whoever is left of Langford, Garland, and Culver

8. De'Andre Hunter, always

We are pretty much locked into the 4th best odds, so those odds were used to calculate our position. I ran 1000 sims to create a big enough sample size, and whenever we ran into a slot where there were multiple options, I just randomly selected one of the available players in the group. Again, unscientific. 

# The Results

The final batch of player draft probabilities are as follows: 

|Prospect|Odds of Drafting|
:--|:-:|
|1. Darius Garland (PG), Vanderbilt|26.3%|
|2. Ja Morant (PG), Murray State|24.7%|
|3. Jarrett Culver (G/F), Texas Tech|17.8%|
|4. Zion Williamson (PF), Duke|12.5%|
|5. Cam Reddish (SF), Duke|5.9%|
|6. Romeo Langford (SG), Indiana|5.6%|
|7. R.J. Barrett (G/F), Duke|5.0%|
|8. De'Andre Hunter (F), Virginia|2.2%|

The biggest takeaway is that Garland is probably our guy. The odds have us landing from 4-6 by a large margin, and by that point in the draft, Morant is off the board and it's usually because Phoenix took him. The most likely result for our pick is #5 and it is a virtual guarantee than the Dukies and Ja are the ones off the board by then.

The second-biggest takeaway is that there was an (unscientific) 51% chance we walk out of this draft with our PG of the future. That's pretty damn cool. 

My third takeaway is that it is very, very unlikely we take home RJ. It seems to only be the pick if we have a very specific draft above us. I am coming around to him but it's clear that a PG, Zion, or a lanky wing are the targets here.

# The Caveats

I do not agree with Tankathon's built-in Big Board for us. Just given what we know about GarPax, they are very unlikely to pick raw project players, as the three they've taken since 2006 (Tyrus, James Johnson, and Marquis) have usually imploded in dramatic fashion. We are also on a somewhat accelerated rebuild path compared to many other lottery teams, and quite frankly don't have 3 years to teach Cam Reddish how to drive to the basket. 

Because of this, I am very hesitant to say that we would draft Reddish over Garland or Culver, and I'm pretty confident that we wouldn't touch Langford at all. The only things overall that would change in the results (given my own opinion of the internal big board) are an even higher chance for Garland, Culver probably moving up in percentage slightly, and Hunter completely absorbing all of Langford's percentages and thus moving to #5 with 7.8%.

# The End

"Given how scarce the NBA is with star PF's, I think Lauri may have the statistical argument for being top 5 at his position already. After looking up the numbers, this is my list as of right now (may be a hot take but I think is statistically justified):

"I feel bad writing this because I think Kris has continued to improve offensively this year (career highs, to be fair-barely, in FG%, 3P%, FT%, Ast, Ast/To Ratio), but he has just not been the defensive stopper we hoped for and it showed this weekend.

Hopefully this is due to his knee not being fully recovered. Signing Rose, Rubio or Collison is far from a guarantee and Ja Morant is the only PG in top 10 of next year's draft.

"Hi everybody, i'm a big lurker here, and would like to talk about or cap situation and free agent prospects this up coming off-season. We currently have 82 million committed next year and the cap is expected to increase to 109 million. with the 3 million dead cap hit from Omer Asik this leaves us with roughly 23.8 million in cap (which is under what a max contract would be). 


Our chances of landing Zion (12.5% at #1) or Ja Morant (12.2% at #2) are not great with just under 25% chance of getting either of them.



So, my question is given our draft capital situation:


Should we dump Felicio and his contract (around 8 m per year) by attaching the 2019 and 2020 second round picks we got from the Grizzlies in the Justin Holiday trade. 

This would bring us to approximately 32 million in cap space (enough for a max)

With this we now have a max spot where we can offer a contract to Kyrie Irving, which would fill our number 1 need.  The appeal for Kyrie is that he gets to come to a major market where he gets to be the face of the franchise, and play with a young good team that can potentially be very competitive within the next few years. He also is only 27 which is slightly older compared to our core, but young enough where he will have quite a few very effective years here.

This would make our starting line up:

Kyrie Irving (PG) - Zach LaVine (SG) - Otto Porter Jr. (SF) - Lauri Markkanen (PF) - Wendell Carter Jr. (C)

The bench would also consist of some valuable pieces with:

Kris Dunn, Denzel Valentine, Chandler Hutchinson, Ryan Arcidiacono, and whoever we take with our pick this year (with this situation hopefully RJ Barrett or Cam Reddish for wing depth)

What are your opinions on this take, and what are your takes on what we should do this summer?

"I like Selden a lot, he‚Äôs a good bench piece. But it bothers me that people act like he‚Äôs this great bench player and Zel shouldn‚Äôt even be in the NBA. Just saying, Denzel is better in every major statistical category.

Zel: 10/5/3 4 on 41% FG

Selden: 7/2/2 on 41% FG (this is his small sample size with us, it‚Äôs worse on the Grizzlies)

Valentine is also a better 3pt shooter, 39% on 5 attempts  a game vs 36% on 4 attempts a game.

Denzel did average 27 minutes while Selden averaged 22 mins, so maybe Seldon makes up for those stats in those extra 5 minutes. 

The only place I see where Selden is definitely better is defense. But despite how much people shit on Denzel‚Äôs defense, his Defensive Box +/- was only -0.1. Wayne Selden‚Äôs Defensive Box +/- for us is is -1.4. Denzel also has a better Defensive Rating, with 107.6, compared to Selden‚Äôs Defensive Rating of 111.9(with us, his rating with the Grizzlies was 105.8, while his rating through the total season is 109.1).

Denzel has a better PER (12.1 vs 7.7), a better TS% 
(.527 vs .511), and a better VORP (0.8 vs -0.4). 

Keep in mind I‚Äôm using only games Selden has played for us, because almost every stat that includes his time with the Grizzlies is worse. So this is his best possible light, and he still doesn‚Äôt match up with Denzel, statistically at least.

Ultimately I think both of these guys are good 8/9/10 player off the bench kind of guys, and I don‚Äôt know why Zel isn‚Äôt considered to be on the same level as Seldon.","Why does everyone say Wayne Selden Jr is better than Denzel Valentine?

"Hello again! I'm back with my second post regarding my commitment to try my best to daily update us in our lottery situation. After reading a lot of comments on my first post, it seems like the Bulls fanbase is quite divided on their expectations for the rest of the season. After thinking and reading the comments carefully, I think we can all agree on one thing, that the rest of this season, should be played with high and great efforts, to lead us into positive momentum for the following season. That being said, many fans believe that tanking is something for last year, and now, it is time for developing and seeing star potential for future seasons. With that said, I will have to agree with the fans that spoke out on that. I want to see the young talent grow and develop more, but also I want to (with fingers crossed), us to win just not enough games, where we end up in the bottom three so that we have the highest chance of landing the first pick. In other words, play hard, and have (as of right now) see the Cavs, Knicks, and Suns, also play hard, so that we end the season with the best lottery chances. As of right now, being tied for fourth worst gives us a 12.5 percent chance. Some people, are totally ok with that. But if we continue a hot streak, we will eventually surpass the Hawks, and end up with a 10.5% chance of getting the first pick. But if we analyze future Cavs, Knicks, and Suns, game, and all hope for them to pull through, hopefully, they will pass the Bulls, and the Bulls will end up with a 14% chance of landing the first pick. 

&#x200B;

So going forward, and as of right now, these posts will be dedicated to see where the Bulls stand, with their lottery chances. We want to see Bulls win and grow! But some of us want high chances of landing a future star in the next draft. Whatever the case may be, all we know is this, within the last 10 games, we're over .500, and we're getting a chance to see what our future is going to look like.  

&#x200B;

***Last night's major implications (3/1)***

**Chicago Bulls (18-45) vs Atlanta Hawks (21-42)** 

When coming down to lottery odds, this game was a major one. Chicago's closest opponent from taking the number 4 slot was Atlanta themselves. A loss to them would've greatly increased our chances of securing the number 4 slot, but with this win, Atlanta falls closer to competing for that number 4 spot. But for Bulls fans, I don't think lottery odds mattered for last night's game. Last night's game, is hands down, one of the best games of the seasons. Truly a nail-biter. Those who want the Bulls to grow, and those who want the Bulls to tank, it could've gone either way. But I am glad it ended the way it did. It is games like these, where star potential and a feeling of a secure future, is realized. Things have been looking  great for the Bulls, and I'm sure most people, don't care that this game affected our lottery odds. 

*Bulls' lottery odds are hurt through this win. But star potential was clearly seen at this game, which, in my opinion, was totally worth it.*

&#x200B;

***Today's Games and Implications (3/2)***

&#x200B;

**Detroit Pistons (29-31) vs Cleveland Cavaliers (15-47)**

Huge implications with this game. Cleveland is holding on to the 3rd spot of the 14% chance of getting the first pick. As of right now, they are our major opponent. They are the ones who's slot we're fighting for. A victory for the Cavs would put them at 16 wins, and making them only 2 games ahead of us. We absolutely need this win from the Cavs. 

*Bulls' lottery odds, get a major increase with a win by Cleveland*

&#x200B;

**Orlando Magic (29-34) vs Indiana Pacers (41-22)**

This is where we get to the redundant part. Games like these, there are not that many major implications because the standings are so far off. Last year, we counted on the Bulls games and who they were competitively tanking with, and keeping track of the New Orleans Pelicans, which netted us Chandler Hutchinson. So games above our pay grade may not be that consequential this year because we have no other drafts besides ours in the first round. So with that said, lets imagine the Bulls go 10-10 the rest of the season, that means we'll likely end up with a record of 27-45. If this is the case, and somehow, Orlando goes 0-20, then we might be competing with Orlando in lottery odds. It is games with teams in the high 20's of wins, where there might be some implications if we end up doing better then 10-10. So with that said, it'd be safer if the Magic wins this game.

*Bulls' lottery odds, increase slightly, with a win by Orlando*

&#x200B;

**Brooklyn Nets (32-32) vs Miami Heat (27-34)**

Same situation as the analysis of the game above, but this time Miami would have a better chance of falling for high lottery odds. Best to root for that one last dance, 21 more times.

*Bulls' lottery odds, increase slightly, with a win by Miami*

&#x200B;

**Golden State Warriors (43-19) vs Philadelphia 76ers (40-22)**

Could this possibly be a finals matchup? Whatever the case, this has absolutely no implications for the Bulls and their lottery odds. But this will probably the game to watch for a Saturday evening!

*Bulls' lottery odds, unaffected by this match up*

&#x200B;

**Memphis Grizzlies (24-39) vs Dallas Mavericks (27-34)**

The Grizzlies are currently sitting on the 6th spot for best lottery odds. I don't know much about the direction of their team, but it seems like they're still trying to be competitive, which is good news for us. Although Dallas may be a team that we're competing with, it is better for the Grizzlies to win so that we can sit comfortably with our number 4 slot. 

*Bulls' lottery odds, increase, with a win by Memphis*

&#x200B;

**Oklahoma City Thunder (38-23) vs San Antonio Spurs (34-29)**

Great match up, just no implications for us. 

*Bulls' lottery odds, unaffected by this match up*

&#x200B;

**New Orleans Pelicans (28-36) vs Denver Nuggets (42-19)**

There isn't much risk posed by the Pelicans, but they are 10 games ahead, when we have 19 games left. Perhaps the Pelicans will truly go tank mode because of this whole AD fiasco. If they do, they might be a team we would worry about in the future. AD, please use your 21 minutes/game, and drop 40 on the Nuggets!

*Bulls' lottery odds, increase slightly, with a win by New Orleans*

&#x200B;

**Los Angeles Lakers (30-32) vs Phoenix Suns (12-51)**

The second most important game to watch for tonight, in regards to our lottery odds. The Suns hold the worst record in the league, making their chances for the first pick very safe. But if they go on a streak, we can find our bottom three, almost evenly lined up. And it's getting to the point where it's close. 

*Bull's lottery odds, increase moderately, with a win by Phoenix Suns*

&#x200B;

**Milwaukee Bucks (48-14) vs Utah Jazz (35-26)**

If you had told me that the Bucks would have the best record in the league at this point, back at the beginning of the season, I would not have believed you. The Greek Freak, is truly a beast in this league that should be an MVP this season. But besides all that, we don't have to worry about this game. 

*Bulls' lottery odds, unaffected by this match up*

If you had told me that the Bucks would have the best record in the league at this point, back at the beginning of the season, I would not have believed you. The Greek Freak, is truly a beast in this league that should be an MVP this season. But besides all that, we don't have to worry about this game. 

*Bulls' lottery odds, unaffected by this match up*

"With tomorrow's game against the Hawks, we only have 20 Chicago Bulls games left for this season. Assuming that we're not going to the playoffs, we're down to the last 3/4 of seeing our beloved Bulls for this season.

&#x200B;

We're at the point where we need to realistically see the direction for where we are going for the future, and in my opinion, that is to tank but develop our young stars, as much as possible. Bulls are currently 4th worst team in the league, and to have the best odds at the number one pick, we need to be within the three worst teams.

&#x200B;

The new rule benefits us, especially in this season. Last year, we were gunning for the worst team. If that was the case now, we would be 5 losses away from the reigning defending tank champions, Phoenix Suns. Instead of being 5 losses away, as of right now, we only have to be 2 games away from the third worst team, the Cleveland Cavaliers.

&#x200B;

I remember someone doing these daily updates for our community last year. It was something that I really appreciated, and after a little bit of thinking, something that I might want to take up this season.

&#x200B;

For those of you who don't know, there was an amazing community member who gave daily reports on ""what needs to happen,"" in order to maximally benefit our tank race, which eventually got us the 7th pick with Wendell Carter Jr. This year, if mods are ok with it, I'm cool with trying my best to give nightly updates about our tank race, and giving the rundown on how we can maximize our tank race. I can't promise that I can do this everyday, but I will definitely try my best.

&#x200B;

Some quick questions to start off these daily posts?

&#x200B;

**Who are you?** I'm just a local Bulls fan since I was in high school, that has been following them since. I'm also a reddit lurker, who doesn't contribute that much, but would like to starting now. I'm not an expert statistician or anything like that, so there might be some mistakes I might make. But believe me when I say bleed bulls red.

&#x200B;

**What's your take on the Bulls?** Absolute supporter, despite the low's we're going through. It sucks that we're one of the worst teams in the league, but from many life experiences, I know that you have to understand the lows, so you can reach the highs. I know the Bulls' time is coming, and before that time comes, we are just a small number of future picks and trades away from that coming. So in short, I want us to tank (For ZION!!) so that we can be amazing for the future.

With that out of the way, here are Friday's (3/1) NBA games.

&#x200B;

**Chicago Bulls (17-45) vs Atlanta Hawks (21-41)**

I cannot emphasize enough how important these next two games are. We're playing Atlanta, back to back. As much as I love watching the Bulls with some positive momentum and some growth with the recent Otto Porter Jr trade, this game is something that we have to lose in. I'm sure that Atlanta is out of the playoff hunt, and like the Bulls, is approaching this season as a ""maximum growth but with the highest chance of high draft pick."" With that said, the Hawks are 4 games ahead of us. It's not an alarming moment, but they are simply our closest opponent to taking the 4th worst position in the lottery odds, thus making these games even more important.  It's cool to see Trae Young develop into a flashy player and all, but I'm sure even the Hawks will appreciate Zion. This is a ""must lose"" so that ""tank can win"" situation.

*Bulls tank gets a double-major win, if Atlanta wins*

&#x200B;

**Charlotte Hornets (28-33) vs Brooklyn Nets (32-31)**

Not much implications here but if we were to choose a win for the tank, it would have to be the Hornets.. The Hornets are over 10 games ahead of us, and they're sitting right outside the playoff picture. They're probably going to be pushing hard against the Nets because they're sitting in the 6th spot of the Eastern Conference.

&#x200B;

*Bulls tank gets a small win, if Charlotte wins*

&#x200B;

**Portland Trailblazers (38-23) vs Toronto Raptors (45-17)**

No major implications here. Both teams are at the top of their respective conferences. Should be a great game to watch.

&#x200B;

*Bulls tank, likely to be unaffected*

&#x200B;

**Washington Wizards (25-36)  vs Boston Celtics (37-25)**

The Wizards are one of the few teams that can threaten the Bulls tank if they go in a huge slump. Bulls are 8 games ahead of them, but to be safe, it would better if the Wizards won. Which definitely can be possible. The Boston Celtics are in a 4 game losing streak right now, and the Bulls/Wizards can definitely take advantage of this night.

&#x200B;

*Bulls tank gets a small win, if Washington wins*

&#x200B;

**New Orleans Pelicans (27-36) vs Phoenix Suns (12-50)**

A moderately major tank game here. Phoenix, currently winning the tank race, plays against the ""half of AD's minutes"" led Pelicans. Once again, not too worried about the Pelicans beating us in tank, although we should be careful as they're season is complete dysfunction, but having the Suns win, would make them and NY Knicks tied for worst team, thus making the competition in the losing 3, a little bit easier. Plus, the Suns just won their last game, so hopefully Booker would use this momentum, to beat the Pelicans.

&#x200B;

*Bulls tank gets a major win, if Phoenix wins.*

&#x200B;

**Los Angeles Clippers (34-29) vs Sacramento Kings (31-30)**

Both teams are right in the middle of the pack, in the Western conference. Marvin Bagley, who was one of the players that our subreddit was fighting for last year, went down with a knee injury last night, thus hurting the chances of the Kings winning. This game will likely be very average to watch.

&#x200B;

*Bulls tank, likely to be unaffected*

&#x200B;

**Milwaukee Bucks (47-14) vs Los Angeles Lakers (30-31)**

I usually don't have time to watch games on Friday nights, but if I were to, I would watch the Bulls and Hawks. After that game, I would probably watch this game. LAbron is apparently in playoff mode, and it should be exciting to watch him single-handedly take on one of the most exciting players of the last few seasons, Giannis Antemptoumpo (idk if i spelled it right). I believe both teams will be playing hard, and whatever the result, Bulls tank should be ok.

&#x200B;

*Bulls tank, likely to be unaffected*

&#x200B;

That's it for tonight! Any feedback? Any questions? Remember, I'm a total noob at this stuff, but I want to become more involved through things like these. Have a good night!

It's not an alarming moment, but they are simply our closest opponent to taking the 4th worst position in the lottery odds, thus making these games even more important.  It's cool to see Trae Young develop into a flashy player and all, but I'm sure even the Hawks will appreciate Zion. This is a ""must lose"" so that ""tank can win"" situation.

*Bulls tank gets a double-major win, if Atlanta wins*

&#x200B;

**Charlotte Hornets (28-33) vs Brooklyn Nets (32-31)**

Not much implications here but if we were to choose a win for the tank, it would have to be the Hornets.. The Hornets are over 10 games ahead of us, and they're sitting right outside the playoff picture. They're probably going to be pushing hard against the Nets because they're sitting in the 6th spot of the Eastern Conference.

&#x200B;

*Bulls tank gets a small win, if Charlotte wins*

&#x200B;

**Portland Trailblazers (38-23) vs Toronto Raptors (45-17)**

No major implications here. Both teams are at the top of their respective conferences. Should be a great game to watch.

&#x200B;

*Bulls tank, likely to be unaffected*

&#x200B;

**Washington Wizards (25-36)  vs Boston Celtics (37-25)**

The Wizards are one of the few teams that can threaten the Bulls tank if they go in a huge slump. Bulls are 8 games ahead of them, but to be safe, it would better if the Wizards won. Which definitely can be possible. The Boston Celtics are in a 4 game losing streak right now, and the Bulls/Wizards can definitely take advantage of this night.

&#x200B;

*Bulls tank gets a small win, if Washington wins*

&#x200B;

**New Orleans Pelicans (27-36) vs Phoenix Suns (12-50)**

A moderately major tank game here. Phoenix, currently winning the tank race, plays against the ""half of AD's minutes"" led Pelicans. Once again, not too worried about the Pelicans beating us in tank, although we should be careful as they're season is complete dysfunction, but having the Suns win, would make them and NY Knicks tied for worst team, thus making the competition in the losing 3, a little bit easier. Plus, the Suns just won their last game, so hopefully Booker would use this momentum, to beat the Pelicans.

&#x200B;

*Bulls tank gets a major win, if Phoenix wins.*

&#x200B;

**Los Angeles Clippers (34-29) vs Sacramento Kings (31-30)**

Both teams are right in the middle of the pack, in the Western conference. Marvin Bagley, who was one of the players that our subreddit was fighting for last year, went down with a knee injury last night, thus hurting the chances of the Kings winning. This game will likely be very average to watch.

&#x200B;

*Bulls tank, likely to be unaffected*

&#x200B;

**Milwaukee Bucks (47-14) vs Los Angeles Lakers (30-31)**

I usually don't have time to watch games on Friday nights, but if I were to, I would watch the Bulls and Hawks. After that game, I would probably watch this game. LAbron is apparently in playoff mode, and it should be exciting to watch him single-handedly take on one of the most exciting players of the last few seasons, Giannis Antemptoumpo (idk if i spelled it right). I believe both teams will be playing hard, and whatever the result, Bulls tank should be ok.

&#x200B;

*Bulls tank, likely to be unaffected*

That's it for tonight! Any feedback? Any questions? Remember, I'm a total noob at this stuff, but I want to become more involved through things like these. Have a good night!

&#x200B;

**Ja**

I'm honestly very whatever on Ja, people keep saying how athletic he is but from my view he has such a mediocre first step, his finishing ability is quite spotty and I can argue his high PPG comes from the volume of FT he shoots per game. That being said, I think he has a remarkable ability to make plays, despite the 5+ T.O. I just see Kris Dunn, and Ja and don't really see an amazing improvement between the two. 

**R.J.**

ahh the former projected #1, I'll be honest watching all the hype videos on R.J. made me so in love with him, learning he comes from an NBA family background, Steve Nash's god son, and that amazing run he had in the USA vs Canada game. In my opinion R.J. is the SAFE pick, I hope he turns out what Wiggins what SUPPOSE to be, an elite wing offensive/defensive combo guard. Here is my biggest fear, the way coach Boylen treated WCJ this season was giving him very limited minutes, he opted to play ROLO waaaay more than WCJ (hopefully something that changes next season) but JUST by going off that, is that going to happen the same way with Porter? I can definitely see a scenario where RJ's development gets stunted because of Boylens tendency to play the veteran players.

**Cam**

Is it weird that out of the three prospects that I want Cam out of any of them? Coming into college he was said to be the next ""Paul George"" extremely overstated I know, HOWEVER, the man is playing behind two ball dominant Duke stars, and is yet putting up numbers that are pretty impressive. He has a good wingspan can guard positions 1-4 and behind offensive players like Zach and Lauri, I feel like he would fit perfectly into being a star 3&D player. This being said I feel like the same argument for Boylen playing Otto over RJ can be said for Cam.

"Guys and Gals, I know why Cris isn't living up to his contract...it's the number 6. That number is a cursed numeral when placed on a Bulls uniform and the only way we'll ever see Felicio live up to his potential is if he changes his number. 

Number 6 has been worn eighteen times throughout Bulls history, more than any other number. Now, for people needing to fact check that, I'm aware that the number 11 has also been worn 18 times as well. However, I'm giving 11 a pass due to BJ Armstrong retiring as a Bull and having to wear 11 rather than his number 10. During his time away from Chicago, the Bulls retired Bob Love's number 10 jersey, thus forcing BJ to choose 11 upon his return in 1999-2000.

Just take a look at this list of players who chose to wear the doomed number 6 for our beloved Bulls. I chose to include some simple stats (year with the team - games played - pts/reb/ast) as further evidence why this number should be banished by the organization.

It's very likely that if Cris finishes his contract in Chicago, he'll only add the lore that is number 6 as I don't envision any team offering him a roster spot post Bulls. That would make him the eleventh player to wear number 6 for the Bulls who would never play in the NBA again. 

It's also kinda spooky when you think about that free agency frenzy back in 2010. Had we landed Lebron, he almost certainly would have worn number 6 as he did on the Heat. Alas, we had to settle for Keith Bogans, arguably the greatest Bull to ever wear number 6.

"Been pondering lately, on how a supposedly talented player in Kris Dunn, is struggling in the league. The glaring and redundant narrative is that, he still can't shoot, finish at the rim nor get to the foul line. But isn't that supposedly the job of a shooting guard?


[The top 20 point guards](http://www.hoopsstats.com/basketball/fantasy/nba/playerstats/19/2/eff)(D.Rose and Brogdon should be in the list) in the league are attacking/scoring PG. Comes after are Dunn, Rubio, Rondo and Peyton.


Obviously, the player's fit with their respective teams are major factors. The likes of Ricky Rubio would out-weight the impact of a top 10 PG in John Wall or even Kemba Walker, playing in their respective teams.


Most SF now can handle the ball, pass and make plays for their teammates. Same goes with the guards. The league is deviating to fill as much triple-threat(pass, shoot and drive) players in their roster as possible(refer to GSW). So where thus these traditional PG sits now?


It's all about the need. I will take Utah Jazz as an example.

&nbsp;

**Ricky Rubio**

Aside from Donovan Mitchell, Jazz players are specialize in each of their crafts. Though could be on the category of a one trick pony(no offense to them), that is now deviated in favor of tweeners unlike the previous era. I will skip the assist 3pt% percentage part, as almost all the 3pt attempts now are assisted. So I won't have to explain the Joe Ingles and Kyle Korver. The case I want to point out is that, what made Rubio effective is Rudy Gobert. [Gobert has a wooping 72.7% of his FG assisted with almost 46% as dunk attempts resulting to 207 dunks. Favors with 74% assisted FG but only 24.3% dunk attempts have himself 102 dunks.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/UTA/2019.html#all_shooting)Let's compare that to Russell Westbrook, who have 46.6 ast%. 

&nbsp;


**Russell Westbrook comparison**

Top two in OKC assisted field goals are Steven Adams 65.4% assisted,	18.3% dunks attempts making	96 dunks. Then Jerami Grant 78.1% assisted, only 15.9% dunks attempts making	80 dunks. The fact that Westbrook needs an open lane to operate, reduced the dunk attempts of big man like Adams, because he will clog the lane for Westbrook. 

&nbsp;


**Kris Dunn**

A big lob target who plays off the ball, is the type of player Kris Dunn and Rajon Rondo doesn't have. The nearest player Dunn have as lob target is Wendell Carter, with 77.6% assisted of which 12.4% of it are dunk attempts resulting to 44 dunks. Next is RoLo with 62.1% assisted, 	7.5% are dunk attempts making	21 dunks. Also worth mentioning is Chandler Hutchison, playing the Jerami Grant role for the Bulls, at the wing as lob target with 62.2% assisted, 9.1%	are dunk attempts making 16 dunks. And for those interested, Cristiano Felicio was able to catch and convert 66% of the passes. He did attempted 10.8% of his shots as dunks and made	9. 

&nbsp;

**Rajon Rondo**

Though Rondo has McGee, he also has LeBron stealing the ball from him in LA. So I would go directly to the Rajon Rondo with Pels and Kings. Rondo has AD as lob target with Pels. AD has 70.1% of his shot assisted,	15.4% dunk attempts with	211 total dunks. WCS was Rondo's lob target in Sac. WCS has 75.9%	of his shot assisted, 28.6% of it are	dunk attempts making 81 dunks.

&nbsp;

**Elfrid Payton**

Although he has AD as lob target with assisted 63.4%,	15.6% dunk attempts(surprisingly the same percentage as last year wow) making	131 dunks, Payton is playing back-up and it's hard to dissect his case.

&nbsp;

Therefore cause of the decline in the demand and effectiveness of traditional PG, was more on the evolution of the game rather than individual talent. As the game goes faster, only a few bigs can keep up with the pace. Teams are filling up the roster with players who can handle the ball, make plays and score. That being merely a facilitator, without the threat to score in a team, becomes a liability. And those PG who can't evolve and keep up with the evolution of the game, are slowly getting push out of commission.

&nbsp;

Therefore cause of the decline in the demand and effectiveness of traditional PG, was more on the evolution of the game rather than individual talent. As the game goes faster, only a few bigs can keep up with the pace. Teams are filling up the roster with players who can handle the ball, make plays and score. That being merely a facilitator, without the threat to score in a team, becomes a liability. And those PG who can't evolve and keep up with the evolution of the game, are slowly getting push out of commission.

"-Dunn 

I know Dunn may not show a lot of potential to some but there‚Äôs not a lot of young guys that play defense as well as him. They just need to let him develop more and I feel like that his offensive game will eventually catch up to his defensive. 

-LaVine

Playing great this year so far in my opinion, obviously he needs to work on his defensive but he‚Äôs been putting up get numbers, and I think he still has a lot of room to improve 

-Porter Jr. 

I feel like the background change with the Bulls is working out really well for Porter. I‚Äôve heard some people saying that they think the bulls will let him go after the contract but he‚Äôs still young and if he continues playing well he should definitely be brought back (on a smaller contract hopefully) 

-Markkanen 

Not much to talk about other than his potential. If he continues his development I think he will definitely be an all-star very soon.

-Carter Jr. 

Same with Carter. It sucks he will most likely sit out the rest of the season but for his first few months in the league as a rookie he already began to show his defensive talent. He‚Äôs a great pair with Lauri at the 4/5 spots and hopefully he will show more improvement on the offensive side next year. 


Overall, I feel like if the bulls stay on the same track and players continue to develop, mature, and stay healthy they will start producing wins. I also think it will be interesting to see where the bulls land in the draft and what they will do with the pick. From how it sounds, it seems like the front office is already giving up on Dunn so I would expect them to draft a Guard. But from how it looks there‚Äôs not a lot of hyped up PGs in the Draft besides Morant.

"I'm super cautious about getting over invested in Zach because of his ACL tear... however...he could be the hero of our franchise. 

He scores at will in the paint and he's proven to be deadly and efficient from range when he doesn't have to carry or deal with double teams all day. He can also carry when called upon. 

Looking forward, he's showing us an increasing number of flashes as a playmaker, racking up higher assist totals and lower turnover rates over the last 20 games. 

He's still 23, 3-4 years off his prime. At this rate, he'll be a triple threat with top tier athleticism. With experience he could become ruthlessly efficient.

"While Mr. Williamson would undoubtedly be the answer to expedite the rebuild (and I say 100 Hail Mary‚Äôs every night before bed that we land him), any player touted to go in the top 4 excite me to factor into this lineup.

Zion- Modern NBA point forward who‚Äôs size and sheer athleticism make him the most prominent prospect in a decade

Ja Morant- if you ask anyone on this sub what the Bulls‚Äô biggest need is you‚Äôd say point guard, and what better fit than the hyper-athletic, long, almost D Rose reminiscent guard that averages 24 and 10. 

RJ Barrett- could you imagine this lineup if Barrett were to start at ‚Äúpoint‚Äù for us in this league where position names are so intangible? Barrett‚Äôs length and scoring prowess would make him lethal next to Lauri and Lavine

Cam Reddish- if we land this guy with, say, the 4th selection, what an upside he‚Äôd be. 6‚Äô9 with your best attribute (supposed, like 32% I think) is 3-point shooting. Having him start at the UC with the The Finn and Zach and Wendell would space the  floor like we‚Äôve never seen before.

Honorable Mentions: Jared Culliver I like but feel as tho Lavine would have to be moved for him to start as I can‚Äôt really see him starting at point as we‚Äôd be an undersized lineup

Romeo Langford has some of the same qualities as Barrett but sometimes it seems like he lacks motivation or a consistent drive

"Can't help to compare Wall's speed, aggressiveness and ability to get into the lanes attract defenses to Ja Morant game. And that LaVine, though not the shooter Beal was, is an offensive machine that would get buckets and pile up points. LaVine though is more athletic than Beal.


Otto Porter plays well with Wall and Beal. I recently watch Otto's wiz highlights and he always find his spot in the three point line, if Wall have the ball in transistion. Ja Morant attacks the rim in transistion as much as Wall does. And I can't help but think that if Bulls draft Morant, they can replicate the trio Washington had success with in Wall, Beal and Porter.


And this is with Bulls having Lauri and Wendell locked in the front court already. Bulls also have a cap space for a max player in 2020. 


Compared to GSW who thrives in the half-court with their shooting, I think Bulls are assembling a team who would thrive in full court with speed and athleticism, if they manage to land Morant this draft. This could be their main selling point to lure AD, as AD was a nightmare in the open court last year with Cousins getting the rebounds. Just imagine Morant or LaVine having the ball in the open court with AD running with them. They you have Lauri and Otto as trailing three pointers. Bulls just made Lauri a better rebounder lately after all.


Are the Bulls cooking an athletic full court team? Gar might have been serious in his ""Young and Athletic"" claim two seasons ago. If this team ever come to fruition, it's going to be a new meta. Just like what GSW is doing now.","Are the Bulls assembling an athletic full court team?

"Much has been said about the Hawks trying to emulate the Golden State Warriors ""formula"" by drafting their versions of Curry (*Trae*), Klay (*Huerter*), and Draymond (*Spellman*). Whether or not those are perfect comparisons is another debate, but it seems like they are trying to find players with similar playstyles and skillsets. 


This got me thinking about what other successful team (past or present) our core is resembling. I came down to the conclusion that if our rebuild develops into the ""best case scenario"", we would be drafting Ja Morant in June and thus creating our own version of the Westbrook, Durant, Harden, and Ibaka young core that the OKC Thunder had a few years ago. Here's why:


**Morant** - *Westbrook*. I know I'm not the first to make this comparison. Explosive point guards with a shaky jumper coming out of college. Great vision and ability to distribute the ball, plays with great intensity. 


**Markkanen** - *Durant*. 7 footer with elite guard-skills. Sharpshooter from outside, comfortable with the ball in his hands, good rebounder, quick on his feet, great (not elite) athlete. Absolute nightmare of a matchup. Markkanen has a lot of commonalities in his game with a young Durant but needs to start shooting off the dribble more to really create the [parallel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-SK77CrFSE). 


**LaVine** - *Harden*. In this case, LaVine is more comparable to the early Houston version of Harden than the OKC 6th man Harden. Crafty and versatile scorer. Limited defender. Athletic playmaker at the SG position. Gets to the line and scores efficiently. 


**Carter Jr.** - *Ibaka*. Defensive anchor of the team. Swat-machine and efficient 4th option on offense. Great rebounder and high motor/intensity presence on the floor. Does the dirty work for the team and versatile in all phases of the game. Perfect complimentary piece.


I know this leaves out our new stud Otto, but there wasn't a good comparison for him with that young OKC team. For the rest of our core players though, I thought the parallels were too uncanny not to share. I think if our rebuild goes down correctly and everyone achieves their best possible projections, we might be building the new age OKC Big 4 in Chicago. 

We suck right now, but we're primed to draft the last piece to this core and would officially be moving into spooky territory.

"I‚Äôm in no way saying we should give up on Dunn for sure, but I thought it might make sense to discuss. This draft isn‚Äôt particularly deep, so I think a playoff team might potentially be willing to trade us their first round pick for Dunn for more immediate talent and help. If so, how high of a pick do you think we could get for him?

With $81.1M on the books and $109M in projected cap space, we should have $27.9M in cap space before any moves. Subtract out the salary for whatever pick we get, say $4.8M for pick ~#4 and add $2.0M back for the likely move of waiving and stretching Asik, we will have roughly $25.1M in cap space before any roster holds.

Assuming we trade Dunn‚Äôs $5.3M salary for a pick in the ~#24 range salary of $1.4M, that frees up an additional $3.9M, bringing our figure above to $29.0M.

This is getting dangerously close to being able to offer a max contract to a 7-9 year player ($32.7M). If we wanted, we could be targeting someone like Kemba Walker. If so, we could be close to having a max contract by trading Valentine‚Äôs $3.4M salary away for a protected second rounder and/or waiving and stretching Felicio instead of Asik (frees up $3.0M in cap space instead of $2.0M).

Would a potential lineup of the following be worth the above moves?

Walker / Arcidiacono?  
LaVine / Blakeney  
Porter / Hutchison  
Markkanen  
Carter / Felicio

We would have picks ~4, ~24, ~36 to add young depth/talent and the MLE to sign a vet big. That would put us at a 12-man roster, potentially 13 if we don‚Äôt have to renounce Archie to accomplish the above.

The risk becomes that since the draft is before free agency, there are no guarantees we can fill our PG hole. There are other free agents like Malcolm Brogdon we could sign if Ja Morant gets taken ahead of us in the draft or Kemba does not want to take a near max deal to play for us. If we sign Brogdon or draft Morant, then we don‚Äôt have to deal Valentine and can keep ~2 of Arcidiacono, Seldon or Luwawu for depth.

To me, it‚Äôs a gamble that seems relative low risk / high reward if we are targeting drafting anyone other than Morant and think we have a good shot at signing either Walker or Brogdon. If you aren‚Äôt reasonably sure you can sign either player, then I don‚Äôt think you trade Dunn on draft night.

"The Bulls have a February Offensive Rating of 118 (which would be 1st in the NBA over the entire season) despite a 103.2 OFF RTG for the season (last). It has only been 6 games, but I was curious if something strategically is changing or is Otto Porter just shooting 58% from three (totally sustainable!). Not surprisingly, it is a combination of both.

&#x200B;

The Bulls and Boylen (giving credit and blame) are still far behind in one aspect of modern basketball, attempting three pointers. For the season, they attempt 26.8 per game which is 27th in the NBA and not much has changed with them attempting 26.7 per game in February, which is 25th for the month. However, Boylen has begun to adapt with the other aspect of modern basketball; points in the paint and getting to the free throw line. I mentioned this in a post about Lauri, but the team (and him) are starting to actually attack the basket and get to the foul line. People make not like watching James Harden, but over 11 FTAs per game is one of the main reasons he is averaging 36 a game.

&#x200B;

In December and January (Boylen started December 3) the team had free throw rates of 21.4% and 21.5% respectively, which were 29th in the NBA for both months. In February their free throw rate has jumped to 27% which is 9th in the NBA this month. It isn't the luck of getting calls (thought this was possible due to the small sample size) as the Bulls are taking more shots at the basket. In December the Bulls took 30.4 FGAs within 5 ft of the basket (20th for month) which was 36.6% of their total attempts. This month they are taking 37.3 FGAs within 5 ft of the basket (3rd in NBA for the month) which is 42.3% of their attempts. Seems simple (and is to certain extent), but taking shots closer to the rim is a good idea!

&#x200B;

That all being said, a handful of this run is luck that players are making their shots. When looking at attempts outside of 10 ft from the basket (jump shots), the Bulls made only 34% of open looks in December (18th in NBA) and 35.4% of wide open looks (28th in NBA). This month they have made 41.9% of open looks (best in NBA) and 43.8% of wide open looks (6th in NBA). While we are a better shooting team with Otto, Lauri and Lavine all on the floor together, we are not a top five shooting team in the NBA (I'm prepared for the angry replies). This will course correct.

&#x200B;

Bulls are shooting above their weight and our offense will come down to earth, but we attacking the basket more and getting more FTAs per game. Regarding the shooting too, while there will be a regression, I don't expect us to fall all the way to the bottom as we were below our skill level earlier in the year.  Essentially, we aren't the best offense in the NBA, but hey, we won't be in the bottom anymore either!

"Hey guys with the recent edition of Otto Porter Jr. I think the bulls are one piece away from our core. At the moment I feel like we have our scoring options in Lauri, Lavine, Porter, Dunn. The thing is that we need one player who can score consistently or be a game changer for us. Because Lauri cant truly find his shot all game he cant be our 1st option.

Scoring Option:

1st:???
2nd: Lauri
3rd: Lavine
4th: Porter Jr.
5th: WCJR
6th Man: Dunn

Our Best fit would ideally be someone at the 1. However the only available PG is Ja Morant. If we dont get him we would need the likes of RJ Barret, Cam Reddish, Zion Williamson. All who are capable scorers and ability to be the No.1 option.

If We Draft Ja Morant:

1st: Lauri
2nd: Lavine
3rd: Ja Morant
4th: Porter Jr.
5th: WCJR
6th Man: Dunn

This line up would force Lauri to be the No.1 Option with Lavine and Morant spreading the floor and creating shots for him.

If We Draft RJ Barret/ Cam Reddish/ Zion Williamson:

1st: RJ/Cam/Zion
2nd: Lauri
3rd: Porter Jr.
4th: Dunn
5th: WCJR
6th Man: Lavine

Selecting a Sg/Sf in the draft will have to force either Lavine or Porter onto the bench halfway through the season. I feel as if Lavine is the ideal 6th Man. However Zach might not be to keen on this but he has been the 6th Man before. 

Our best fit is finding our PG of the future which Ja Morant is very capable inside out player that can spread the floor for Lauri although his 3pt% is questionable, at least he does try to keep the defenses honest. 

Which Line up do you prefer? Also do you feel like Talent/over Position is better? ","We‚Äôre one piece away from our core.

"So I crunched sone numbers on our boy Lauri because I noticed he‚Äôs been going off since Carter jr. has been injured, most notably on the boards. The actual stats ended up being pretty eye opening.

Playing before Carter‚Äôs injury (essentially alongside Carter):

21 GP (games played)
16.5 PTS 
6.7 REB 
130 FGM (field goals made)
302 FGA (field goals attempted 
43 FG% 
48 3PM (3-pointers made)
130 3PA (3-pointers attempted)
36.9 3p% 


Playing without Carter:

14 GP 
21.4 PTS *
11.6 REB *
100 FGM
224 FGA
44.6 FG% 
40 3PM
100 3PA
40 3P% *

Asterisks * indicate noticeable improvement

It‚Äôs also worth noting that he averaged just over 30 minutes a game with Carter in and only a few minutes more with him out (around 33-34).


If we can figure out how to sustain this kind of production when Carter jr returns, we will have one of the best front courts on the league! Markkanen still has a disappointingly low BPG (blocks per game) metric even with Carter out but if we leave that up to Wendell when he returns, the sky is the limit!

Player A - Kristaps Porzingis

Player B - Lauri Markkanen

&#x200B;

Kristaps is already regarded as one of the best bigs in the league, and (easily) one of the 10 best franchise pieces moving forward in the entire league. Hopefully next season, in Year 3, when the baby Bulls take their next step forward (hopefully a Nets/Kings-like improvement at the least), Lauri will establish himself as one of the premier bigs in the entire league. I don't see any reason as to why he couldn't be even better than KP is, as he \[obviously\] has the skill-set.

&#x200B;

Health-permitted, I expect big things out of Lauri next season (and moving forward), especially if a new coach is brought in with a \[modern\] offense that can maximize his talents. Hopefully he gets more attention around the league as well as he develops into one of the best bigs in the league.

With that said, currently we're slotted at the 4th spot in the draft. If things don't move (standing-wise), we would be right in line for either RJ Barett or Cam (See)Reddish-- both wings. Unless GarPax are fine with putting either RJ or Cam on the bench until we move on from OPJ, I keep thinking that we're about to swing a trade for Ja Morant. How we do that, I'm not sure. Do we do a Dallas and trade a future 1st? Since Phoenix is right in line for Morant (2nd), I don't think they'd bite on a trade considering how thirsty they are for a point guard.

"[Here's the link to his latest Synergy stats - it's a screenshot so no paywall.](https://twitter.com/DuncanSmithNBA/status/1094817994927230976) For the unfamiliar, percentile is what percentage of the league you are better than or equal to in that area.

He also has good marks in Iso, transition, hand offs, cuts, and put-backs which are probably to be expected. He also ranks 82nd percentile in Misc., which basically just means he's a cleanup/bailout god. 

What do you guys think, is this a feasible transition, or something worth pursuing in the future if we don't draft a PG?

EDIT: I figured it might help to give some context, so I'll list some other lead guards from the same screenshot thread and their ranks as a PNR ball handler:

* Damian Lillard - 93% (Excellent)

"We've all seen it and talked about it. Collectively, we've cringed, cried and turned our heads at the horror that is ""BoyBall"". Lately, however, reading comments during games and in other posts I've noticed a few Bulls fans that are brave enough to come out of the dark and mutter words that would usually result in downvotes and death threats. Here, I'll give it a go myself.

**Maybe Jim Boylen knows what he's doing.**

***GASP***...how dare he! OFF WITH HIS HEAD!!!

Please, spare my head fellow Bulls fans. I do not come with word that Coach Boylen is our savior, nor do I think he should be the coach of this team next year and beyond. I will give credit where credit is due, and Boylen certainly deserves a fair shake of the credit tree.



On Decemeber 4, 2018, Coach Boylen took to the sidelines in his first game as a head coach after the firing of Fred Hoiberg. He has since coached in 32 games with a record of 8-24. This is how those first 32 games look statistically. I've only included basic counting and percentage stats for this write up. Please feel free to add more to this discussion if I've missed something important.

Holy cow. We suck. As you can see we are near the bottom in nearly every counting and advanced metric stat. There is some encouraging thoughts considering we shoot the ball alright, when we actually get shots. Our turnovers aren't as bad as I thought they'd be, and we're getting a decent amount of steals. Seems about right with ball hawks such as KD, Shaq and Arci guarding the primary ball handlers every game. 

It's also worth noting our schedule during these very trying times. Of these 32 games only five of them were against actively tanking teams (WAS, CLE, ATL, NOP). We played ORL three times and while they aren't tanking, they aren't exactly a playoff team even though they have stated their goal this season are the playoffs. That's 24 games against teams that are guaranteed to make the playoffs to most certainly barring a catastrophe going to make the playoffs. Not exactly the best company for a team that puts up a tough fight and loses to Cleveland.

So, you've made it through the first 22 games of BoyBall? Maybe you're like me and you start to see something, not sure what it is since we're still losing at the same rate, but there's something about this team that looks and feels different. You notice they are passing a bit more, getting better shots, scoring 100+ consistently. Nah, it's still the same Bulls and we still suck. Hmph.

Alright. These last ten games haven't been so bad. We still suck, but there seems to be less of it. We're 3-7, still preserving the tank and our team has looked a helluva lot more fluid and cohesive. We're scoring like we're actually members of the modern NBA and with good efficiency. Rebounding is still an issue but don't let the terrible offensive rebounding numbers deter you. You know who actually sits behind us in that category? Milwaukee. Yes, the league best Bucks actually pull down even less offensive rebounds that your Chicago Bulls. This is all without WCJ and more often than not playing Lauri and Bobby at the 5, both of which are natural PF's. 

During this ten game span we only played five games against playoff caliber squads. The Bulls met Cleveland twice and had match ups against a severely limited Pelicans squad and a Wizards team that just learned of John Walls injury and traded their starting small forward. Nevertheless, the Bulls are starting to look like a different team during these last ten games.

Whew! You see that? Less suck! Way less suck! This team actually leads the league in an offensive stat (despite the small sample size)! Yes, this same team that was cursed upon for being stuck in a league that played before most of you were born are actually putting up some big offensive numbers. This really doesn't come as much surprise when you think about it. Lauri has been on a tear, Zach is still doing his thing and we're not playing guys like AB at all while also reducing the minutes of the offensively inept Shaq Harrison.

These numbers are also a reflection of what Bobby Portis was doing so there is good chance the offensive outburst subsides as OPJ settles into his role. However, it's very likely the numbers continue at a solid pace with the addition of OPJ. I'm certain we won't maintain such a scorching OFF RTG but it is very encouraging to see this team producing numbers like this.

It's worth noting these last five games have been against MIA, CHA, NOP, WAS, & BKN. Only WAS and NOP in this stretch are ""tanking"" teams while MIA and CHA aren't exactly the cream of the crop. 

In conclusion, as I said before, maybe this Boylen guy knows what he's doing. I always think back to that 2010-2011 Bulls team with Thibs in his first year. That team started out 9-8 and finished the season 53-12. I am NOT comparing Boylen to Thibs, but merely comparing the scenario of a new coach with a new team and how there will be an adjustment period. Maybe it's time we set down our pitch forks and let Jim do his job. He's not equipped to coach this team for many years to come, but perhaps his knowledge of the game can do some good for a young team with nothing to lose. Lauri is playing really well, the team is swinging the ball, we're not biting on passes and losing our defender, our turnovers are down. Despite the poor defensive numbers, we're empty at the 5 (still love you ROLO) and lack any depth. This team is going to have a huge stride forward next year. I can't wait.




I apologize in advance for the formatting, I do not know how to put tables into these comments. It's late and I'd love to explain some numbers more but I'll let them speak for themselves. Go Bulls!

"Yeah yeah, I know, Fuck GarPax and Boylen can suck mine. But let's look at the bigger moves they made this year. 

Trade #1:

Justin Holiday to the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for¬†Wayne Seldon (hypno-eyes)¬†and two second-round draft picks. Not only did moving Holiday bring in some nice assets for us, but it also helped us give our boy Hutchinson some more playing time/usage. Imo, great move by GarPax 

Hot take: Seldon is really fun to watch, talented and younger/better than Holiday the chucker. We got 2 second round picks too in this move somehow, just all around good trade. 


Trade #2:

The biggest trade came on Feb 6 when the Wizards agreed to send us Otto Porter¬†in exchange for¬†Bobby Portis,¬†Jabari Parker¬†and a 2023 second-round pick. 

Hot take: Now, I'm definitely gonna miss my dude crazy eyes. The energy he brought was always welcome, and he was young enough to grow with the rest of the team. I'm a pretty big Otto fan though - he's one of the best 3&D players in the league and he's only 25. His contract is what gets brought into question usually, but that doesn't really hurt us right now with our cap space as flexible as it is. We very likely weren't gonna re-sign Jabari anyway, so fuck it send him to the Wizards. I like this trade too tbh and think our core just got a lot better. 

Conclusion: To me, GarPax legit seem to know what they're doing when it comes to trading and drafting. The hump they can't seem to get over is the people side of things. Hiring Hoiberg originally was a shitty decision that ended up working out surprisingly well due to his solid player development ability. You would think now that we finally have a team that is perfect for the long-awaited Hoiball, he'd get a chance to try it out. Nope, he gets fired right as the starters get healthy and replaced with (*holds in vomit*) Jim Boylen. My guess is they did this to solidify the tank, cause Hoiberg was actually competent enough to win us more games than the tank would have allowed. 

As a long time Bulls fan, it makes me sick to my stomach that I need to admit this... But GarPax have actually been doing a decent job this year, wouldn't you say?

Sorry about the long post, was hoping to get some in-depth discussion in.

"Before the trade deadline, the Bulls dealt Bobby Portis, Jabari Parker, and a 2023 second-round pick in return for the former #3 pick Otto Porter Jr. This exchange was met with mixed reactions on both sides; The Wizards received seemingly little in return for a quality player, and the Bulls were saddled with Porter‚Äôs hefty contract.

&#x200B;

Now let‚Äôs break it down and discuss why Otto‚Äôs salary isn‚Äôt that big of an issue for this Bulls team. In the 2016-2017 season, Otto Porter tallied 9.4 Win Shares (21st best in the league). In 2017-2018, he racked up 8.1 Win Shares (26th best in the league). Here you can see how Otto stacked up against the rest of the league last season according to ùö´WS: [https://i.imgur.com/w2rqDzT.png](https://i.imgur.com/w2rqDzT.png)

&#x200B;

As you can see, he‚Äôs already shown a history of outperforming his ‚Äúoverpaid‚Äù contract. He was more valuable than stars like Bradley Beal, Jrue Holiday, and CJ McCollum (and that was 2018, the year before he was even better!)

&#x200B;

However, Otto has relatively struggled this year. But is this Otto‚Äôs fault? In 2017, Washington earned the 4th seed and went an impressive 49-33. In 2018, the Wizards fought their way back into the playoffs. This year however, they are struggling mightily, posting a 23-32 record as of February 9th. With John Wall‚Äôs achilles injury, Bradley Beal floating around the trade block, and front office‚Äôs dysfunction on full display this year it should come as no surprise that it has taken a toll on everyone. However, even for the down year‚Äôs he‚Äôs having, Porter is still on pace to tally 4.4 WS. According to last year‚Äôs ùö´WS graph, that would make him a player worthy of $15m a year.

&#x200B;

So then you must ask yourself, if the current Otto Porter Jr on the court is valued at $15m, is it still an overpay? Traditional thinking would say duh, he‚Äôs earning $26m this season. However, you must now consider everything else he brings to Chicago:

&#x200B;

1. For the first time since Jimmy Butler was traded, the Chicago Bulls now have a starting caliber small forward on the court. The attention he demands grants more space for everyone. He's been a very very good player in the past, he can become that player again, and other teams know that. Maybe all he needed was a change of scenery.
2. He is a career 40% 3-point shooter, the spacing he provides for Lauri and crew cannot be understated. Especially when at one point in the season Shaq Harrison of all people was being rolled out at the wing.
3. The Bulls now have a player capable of defending the other team‚Äôs best player. Going into the season, everyone expected the Bulls to have a high powered offense and a non-existent defense. Yet here we are at the halfway point, and the Bulls now put out 3 strong defenders in their starting 5. More importantly, Zach Lavine can now be hid on defense.
4. HE‚ÄôS STILL ONLY 25! We overpaid for Lavine this summer on the pretense that we could expect him to develop even further into that contract. If OPJ‚Äôs ‚Äúbad‚Äù is $15m a year, how much is he worth when he‚Äôs firing on all cylinders? Must players that hit free agency at 25 either suck or are restricted, we got lucky acquiring a player that actually fits our timeline here.
5. Every team needs a glue guy. The Andre Iguodala, Robert Covington and Khris Middletons of the world. A guy who can play off-ball and still be a big plus, there‚Äôs a reason all the advanced stats love him. He covers for our young guy‚Äôs weaknesses and enhances their strengths. It would be hard to find another player on the trade market who could help develop our core as much as he potentially can.

&#x200B;

If the worst version of Otto Porter Jr is worth $15m, and that‚Äôs the guy we‚Äôre getting, so be it. But I‚Äôd wager he can recapture his prior form. But even if he can‚Äôt, he‚Äôs still worth it to us. If the Bulls could buy an insurance plan for $11m that guarantees Lauri, Lavine, and Wendell can thrive and develop properly, don‚Äôt you think they would? That‚Äôs the biggest asset Otto brings to our team. We finally get to see the best version of our young core and evaluate them properly. His presence has also made our free agency decisions this coming summer much easier with Bobby Portis already shipped out. All of our attention can now be directed towards the draft and the search for a new coach. The Chicago Bulls have a direction. It‚Äôs looking upwards.","Hot Take: Otto Porter Jr Isn't Overpaid (Here's Why) Before the trade deadline, the Bulls dealt Bobby Portis, Jabari Parker, and a 2023 second-round pick in return for the former #3 pick Otto Porter Jr. This exchange was met with mixed reactions on both sides; The Wizards received seemingly little in return for a quality player, and the Bulls were saddled with Porter‚Äôs hefty contract.

"Lauri has obviously been shooting lights out recently (58% over last 3 games) and it is the main reason for his run, but what has me particularly excited is how he is starting to get to the foul line. 

It‚Äôs an incredibly small sample size to be fair, but over his last 6 games he has gotten 5 or more free throw attempts 5 times (83% of games).

In his 94 career games prior to this, he had gotten 5 or more FTAs a total of 14 times (15% of games).

His shot has always forced defenders to close out on him and because he has a decent handle for a big, Lauri has always been able to get a first step on defenders. However, his lack of quickness frequently allows the defender to essentially catch up. Lauri would pick up his dribble and end up taking a mid range jumper or passing out unless the lane was clear for a dunk. Some of it is luck and getting the calls, but I think he is attacking the hoop more even when the lane isn‚Äôt clear (went at Jarrett Allen a couple times!). He is looking to body more while facing the basket (not just trying to back down and shoot over smaller defender) and dragging/holding his shot to either draw contact or freeze rim protector (avoid block, get clear look). 

Easy buckets and efficiency are key! Not mentioned, but also huge, he is boxing out and rebounding!

\- Lauri's son Alvar and his wife Verna has never been shown to the media this openly.

\- He has sick shoe collection.

\- They talk about Lauri's diet, which does not include red meat and milk products. He said that because of the high competition level at NBA, he tries to find competitive edge even from the diet.

\- During his college year, he went to party only once, and didnt actually stay there for a minute.

\- He has never used alcohol because he always tries to be best version of himself. 

\- He drives electric car,

\-They talk about their relationship (Lauri and Verna) and how people have preconseptions about their relationship.

\-The whole family seems so genuine and the athmosphere in the episode is suprisingly relaxed for a TV-show.

\-Lauri and the host tried to go play some street ball but when Lauri saw that the court was reserved, he became a little anxious because of the possible overly attention, so they turned back. Lauri isn't use to the attention and even hates it some times.

\-Lauri's relation to the money: He thinks that it can help to bring happiness through certainty about some things. 

\-Some of his former high school friends have tried to contact him to get some financial benefit.

\-They joke about Kardashian's curse.

\-When they got pass the queue, Lauri said that he got some bad  conscience.

\-Even though Lauri will probably lose most of the personal privacy, he still wants to be superstar and become the best player of them all.","Episode from finnish show, in which the host is spending two days with Lauri's family.

"While a lot of people might not like yesterday‚Äôs trade there is are a few important changes to the team and the direction going forward.  

The team certainly wasn‚Äôt going to attract any big names in free agency and are clearly building a young core. While Otto Porter maybe over payed, its money the franchise should and will be spending anyway.  If Jabari Parker is worth 20 million then, why not 27 million for Otto Porter.?

Ottomatic is 25 and does fit in with the Bulls over all timeline.  He‚Äôs experienced and will help solidify the defense on the perimeter, getting into the passing lanes to starting fast breaks.  This will speed up the offense, that has drawn criticisms recently for its slow pace.  This new Bulls look will be long, athletic, and will be able to shoot the 3. The projected starting lineup next year will all be able to help space the floor given their better than average percentages from this year. 

Kris Dunn - 36%
Zach Lavine - 35%
Otto Porter - 37% (career 40%)
Lauri Markkanen - 39%
Wendell Carter Jr. - well Wendell has shown flashes of being able to shoot the ball. 

I‚Äôm guessing the Bulls will be targeting a backup center in free agency now and will be looking to take best possible talent off the draft board.   Having Otto Porter does probably take them out of the running for most of the young SF prospects of which roughly 6 of the top 10 prospects play. So here‚Äôs hoping we lose a bunch of games and hit on the top 2 picks. Zion would be ideal, but Ja Morant would definitely bring the Bulls back to a must watch status. 

Regardless, the Bulls picked up a nice, young, talented player who has had a down year on a bad team in Washington. As a previous #3 overall pick he still has plenty of talent and could end helping be a glue guy the helps bring some of the young talent together on the court.  Given his age it‚Äôs hard to see him becoming a complete albatross of a contract given that we only owe him around 55 million and have paid Omer Asik almost 30 million over the last 2 years. 

It‚Äôs still a long road up for the Bulls but at least now it‚Äôs clear who the building blocks of the franchise are and the direction that the team can and will be going in.

"In 2017, management finally made the decision to forego being stuck in NBA purgatory where the team is good enough to make the playoffs but not good enough to never seriously have a chance at title contention.

Fastforward 2 years later and management trades for Otto Porter Jr, signaling its inability to sign a marquee FA and forgo future cap space.  The Bulls will now tout a starting lineup of Dunn, LaVine, Porter Jr, Markkanen and Carter Jr.  for the foreseeable future with zero chance of acquiring a transcendent talent outside of this years lottery pick.  While the 5 players in this starting lineup are all young, talented players, none likely have the ability to be a top flight talent needed to take the team to being a serious championship contender.

","[Serious Question] Are the Bulls back in the same situation prior to the Jimmy Butler trade? In 2017, management finally made the decision to forego being stuck in NBA purgatory where the team is good enough to make the playoffs but not good enough to never seriously have a chance at title contention.

Fastforward 2 years later and management trades for Otto Porter Jr, signaling its inability to sign a marquee FA and forgo future cap space.

[**The¬†Trade**](https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1093307081040560128)

**Washington Wizards Receive:**¬†Jabari Parker, Bobby Portis, 2023 second-round pick

**Chicago Bulls** **Receive:** Otto Porter Jr.

**Grades**

**Wizards: C**

Seriously? This is all you can get for a player of Otto Porter Jr.'s ilk?¬†

Sure, the Wizards get out from under some long-term money, which is vital when they're on the hook for $170 million over the next four years for just post-Achilles-rupture [John Wall](http://bleacherreport.com/john-wall). But Porter is still a solid talent who fits perfectly into so many modern schemes with his off-ball prowess. Surely something better had to be out there, even if finding it required waiting until the offseason.

During an admittedly down season, he's continuing to function as a deadly spot-up shooter who's knocking down [37.8 percent](https://stats.nba.com/players/catch-shoot/?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*Otto) of his catch-and-shoot triples. That's a far cry from last year's numbers ([44.4 percent](https://stats.nba.com/players/catch-shoot/?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*Otto&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) on 3.5 attempts per game), but the regression is understandable when he's been operating for a team in flux that features changing bodies at the 1.¬†

Porter isn't a star, and he may even be a bit overpaid. But the Wizards still aren't getting anything for him other than two post-hype fliers who are basically on expiring contracts. Parker could potentially be picked up for a $20 million team option next year (highly unlikely), while Portis (restricted) really will hit the open market this summer.¬†

Normally, that's a good thing. But is it really a huge benefit for a team still saddled with [$89.2 million](https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/WAS.html) in expenditures to Wall, Bradley Beal, Ian Mahinmi, [Dwight Howard](http://bleacherreport.com/dwight-howard) and Troy Brown Jr. for 2018-19? What good does that extra cap space do for a team already paying out a ton of money and featuring a rotation devoid of players in their prime?

Perhaps it gives Washington a chance to escape the luxury tax even while extending Thomas Bryant and Tomas Satoransky. But don't get too excited unless you truly believe those are players around whom you can build a championship roster.¬†¬†

**Bulls: A**

The bad news: Porter is owed $27.3 million in 2019-20, then he has a player option for $28.5 million during the following season.¬†

Aaaaand...that's about it.

Everything else is positive here, and the Bulls can afford to absorb an elevated salary for a high-end role player because so many of their key pieces are on cheap, rookie-scale contracts.¬†

Porter's off-ball acumen should help him mesh perfectly with Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn and Lauri Markkanen, all of whom need the rock in order to maximize their skill sets. He plays defense, which helps make up for the defensive liabilities/projects taking the floor on a regular basis. He's willing to do the little things‚Äîalways an important trait for a glue guy on an up-and-coming roster.¬†

Maybe he makes the pursuit of top odds in the Zion Williamson sweepstakes a bit tougher, but that's a price Chicago should be willing to pay right now. Landing a player of Porter's caliber is hard, particularly when you're offering nothing more than two expiring contracts and a second-round pick conveyed years into the future.¬†

"TLDR: I pray every night that lauri is the messiah, as prophesied. If he is not I will be sad, only to be happy when our next messiah is chosen. 

Overall, I would say that I like where the bulls are. Rebuilds take time, and we have some good young assets on our roster. I know garpax gets a lot of hate‚Äîsome of it rightfully so‚Äîbut they built what could have been a dynasty only to have that opportunity stripped away thanks to injury. Not only that, but they were left with aging players ready to win now on a team that couldn‚Äôt get over the hump. After that, we immediately rebuilt with the butler trade and got a great return. The bulls have drafted well lately, and I personally think they‚Äôve done a good job with trades to accumulate more valuable assets than what they started with. We‚Äôve got a very good young core, right now, and we‚Äôre getting a top pick in this year‚Äôs draft. We have solid cap space, and there are 2 scenarios that I‚Äôd be happy with for our future.

Scenario 1: it works out

I think it‚Äôs safe to assume that our core isn‚Äôt going to regress over the next few years. With that being said, I‚Äôd love to see us get a top pick. If we land in the top 3 beautiful. Personally I want Ja Morant. If he‚Äôs there, we draft him. If not, Dunn + our pick for morant. With him, Dunn becomes either a trade chip or he can help solidify a good, young 3-man backcourt. I like Dunn myself, so I‚Äôd rather see that happen. Sign good young role players in FA and get vets. I‚Äôm not going to bother predicting the future after that, but just assume everything works out. I‚Äôm really hoping for lauri to become what I think he could be, which is the league‚Äôs most unguardable player not named Giannis.

Scenario 2: S.S.D.D.

For all of you who don‚Äôt know what that means, go play mw2 and then come back. As I said before, I think it‚Äôs safe to assume our young core succeeds. We turned 1 superstar into 3 good young players. They may not be enough to get us into contention, but they can put other teams over the hump. We have a fire sale on this current rebuild. Trades on trades. Keep one or two young players, IF they show extreme promise and if we can resign them for the long term. In 2-3 years, guys like lauri lavine and Wendell could be worth an absolute ton in trade talks. Blow it up, make our team suck enough to get a top pick, and have a shitload of picks for lamelo ball and bronny jr (I‚Äôm half kidding, but know that my other half is dead serious). Rebuild around the guys we keep and our new guys. If we don‚Äôt keep anyone, so be it. More new guys for us. 

If you read this far I will now tell you ssdd means same shit different day you‚Äôre welcome

"With the news that was released few days ago, that everyone in the bulls are available for a trade, I started to think what could we get for our trade targets... personally I would keep all of them. Trade Lopez and Parker if we can for a young players or first rounder if possible.

And I came to conclusion that I have no idea how to value our players...

Kris Dunn - there has been talks that our FO would trade Dunn or bring a veteran PG who would put some pressure on his position of starting PG.
If we try to trade him, what could we get in return? A think he would be one of the best bench leaders point guards. But no team will give anything that worthy for bench player. Maybe package him with second rounder for Lonzo Ball? Or some similar package for another player?
I would like to keep him and see if he can improve... and I don't really like Lonzo that much but he has plenty of potential...

Zach Lavine - he is our best player and shooter at the moment. A think very highly of him, and would also keep him, because he and Lauri are definitively our future... He has a big long contract, and that might scare other teams. A think he can play in any  team in the NBA as starter, at least as sixth player. His defense is bad, but he improved a bit on that part. 
He would be upgrade on any team battling for playoff. 
So what would he bring in a trade lottery pick and a young player? More? Less?


Bobby Portis - there has been talks that our FO is scared that he might want a bigger salary than we are willing to give, and probably won't match the offer as restricted FA. There a re a lot of teams that could benefit from his talents. But he is a RFA who might be overpaid next season... He has been improving year after year, and might become a really good stretch four who can average double doubles in next two years...
Value? Maybe a late lottery with a bad contract in some package?

Robin Lopez - I love this dude, but I feel he can't bring us much as trade target. Maybe if we take a bad contract he could bring a late first rounder.

Jabari Parker - we gave him a lot of money to play SF... He didn't play the position, or better to say, he didn't play at all...
In small sample he averaged 14pts, 6 reb, 2ast in little over 20 minutes per game... Maybe based on that some team would want him but he would be attractive only because of his team option. And based on that we might get something out of it...

Denzel Valentine - he is a pretty good 3pt shooter, and that is it... injury this year didn't help him at all. Really don't know his value, but I feel we would have more interest developing Selden or Hutch...

I mean, if we got 2 second rounders and Selden for Holiday, maybe we can get at least one good player.

Definitively I would like to see Dunn, Lavine, Lauri and Wendell as our core in the future, with Portis, Hutch, Selden as bench players...

I am really interested in your opinion. What do you think of the value our roster has?

"This whole KP trade seems fishy. Your franchise star (albeit injured) comes in and sorta (?) asks for a trade because he‚Äôs not sure if the culture is right in NY and you trade him within 2 hours? That makes 0 sense to me. How did the Mavs get so quick on that deal and get away with such a lowball of a trade? I have a feeling that the league, the Knicks, and the Mavs premeditated this deal and this is why:

**What‚Äôs in it for the NBA executives?** Huge international appeal in having 2 of the biggest euro stars on the same team in KP and Luka. Dallas becomes super relevant in the West as soon as KP is healthy. An ACL today is nothing like it was in the past, and if KP has been staying true to his rehab, there‚Äôs no doubt he‚Äôs going to be back 100% by 2020. Jersey sales skyrocket and the international market is captivated by its two brightest stars playing together and eventually competing for playoffs rather than wasting away on bad teams. 

**What‚Äôs in it for the Knicks?** I believe that the NBA execs promised NY the #1 overall pick. This means that if true, the Knicks will win the lottery and have the opportunity to select Zion Williamson. This is the kind of player that would galvanize the NY market, and the league is willing to do this for the Knicks because they have a terrible record anyways and the draft reform adds some more ‚Äúluck‚Äù to the equation this year. I think we can all agree that it wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúluck‚Äù that we just so happened to land DRose, Chicago‚Äôs very own, in 2008 with a 1.8% chance. The league has potentially set precedent for doing this before. The Knicks believe DSJ and Zion gives them an exciting young core that can attract free agents in the future, and don‚Äôt have to gamble on KP‚Äôs return to form. 

**Why do the Mavs do it?** It‚Äôs been long reported this season that the Mavs FO has been trying to move DSJ. This is not a surprise to anybody that they finally traded him. The fit with Luka wasn‚Äôt there and the relationship with the player was potentially broken once the trade reports got out. Mavs get what they want, another star player that will fit with Luka, and DSJ gets to play on a team with opportunity. Win-win. 

All 3 parties have a plausible motive for making this deal. This is all conjecture, but I have a feeling that something off is going on here. If the Knicks land the #1 pick in the lottery, it would only reinforce my suspicions that the league rigs the lottery. What do you guys think?","Possible collusion between the Knicks, Mavs, and NBA?

"Decided to look at results with and without lavine since Boylen became coach.

When lavine is out of the line up 4-2 (Spurs, Heat, Nets, OKC, Cavs and ORL. Opponents PPG total comes out to 95.16 through 6 games.

With Lavine in the line up they're 2-6 against the same teams listed above (excluding spurs) and boylen as coach. opponents PPG of 108.62 through 8 games.  

Complete record with Lavine in line up and Boylen as coach is 3-19. Opponents ppg through 22 games 112.72.

According to NBA's team PPG 
‚Ä¢OKC      114.5
‚Ä¢SPURS  112.6

‚Ä¢HEAT    105.3
‚Ä¢ORL       104.3
‚Ä¢CAVS    102.6

The most interesting part with the 4-2 record with out lavine bulls gave up 100+ one time against OKC.  They held spurs, Orlando, Cavs and miami under 100 points in each win.  They held the nets under 100 in their loss. 5 out of the 6 games bulls successfully held teams under 100 points.

Against these same teams (OKC,Nets, Cavs and Heat) with Lavine, Bulls gave up 100+ in all but 2 games (Cavs/ORL). They went 2-6 against these teams.  I did not count the game on 11-26-2018 against the spurs since boylen wasnt coach. Lavine did play that game and spurs won, scored 108 in that game.

I checked a few more LaVine player stats since this sparked my curiosity. 

‚Ä¢ OPP PTS OFF TO- 11.8 among the highest in the league

‚Ä¢ Turnovers Per Game- 3.5  9th highest in the NBA.

"When you consider what the Bulls would have to give up, it would make no sense for a team in their position to try and get Davis. They would almost certainly have to trade Lauri and/or Carter plus this years 1st to get Davis. And why would that be a smart move?

"I'm not a huge fan of them myself but I think a big chunk of our fans are underestimating them. 

At first glance we're one of the worst teams in the league. We fired our HC midseason just before our roster was getting healthy and replaced him with Jimbo who's clearly stuck in the 90s. One would think ""what the hell are they doing?""

But here's the thing: They know exactly what they're doing. 

Remember last season when we were supposed to be the worst team in the league but ended up with ""only"" the 7th pick? That didn't sit well with them at all. I mean I LOVE Wendell and they do too but it was to be *the* year to suck really bad so we could accelerate this rebuild with a top 3 pick.

Now the current season was supposed to be a big improvement with all the guys getting healthy and better in the offseason. But it wasn't to be. We were suffering yet another injury plague. We were bad. Especially the effort and defense was a joke. That's were GarPax noticed that a door was opening for us: Zion

We might have some good young pieces for the future but GarPax know we need another potential allstar-calliber player to even think about contending in the far future. If there's a chance to get hold on a generational player ala Zion, now's the perfect time. 

Fred got canned so we don't accidentaly start a winning streak again like last season. They replaced him with Jimbo who keeps us competitive for the tank but also toughens up our players a little bit and preaches some defense. I don't think that this will hurt our development, only delay it a bit. And I also believe that Fred was never going to be our coach after his contract expiration. We hired him way before the rebuild and he simply didn't turn out to be good enough in GarPax' eyes. Also it's not uncommon for a team to go through multiple coaches during a rebuild. Boylen is *not* gonna be our long term HC.

If he doesn't get dealt pass the deadline, I'm not sure how the money would work this off season, but maybe we can decline his option, then rework a longer deal with less money per yr

I think we get a top four pick, and pick the best player available, regardless of position.   


I think we try to get veterans ala Darren Collison (not him specifically, but like him) to replace the departed RoLo, to save the Bulls' image   


If BP doesn't get traded this deadline, I think he signs the qualifying offer, then gets traded

"I don't know where else to ask so I'll ask here. Maybe it's a stupid question. 
I don't really follow NCAA basketball because I'm from Europe and don't have much time. But I have looked at some NCAA coaches that could be good...

But my question is this. What is main difference between NCAA coach and NBA coach?? 

I've been looking on the internet for a potential coach for bulls after we get rid of Boylen. And i found some interesting candidates (Ettore Messina, and few assistant coaches from NBA).  

I know we hired Hoiberg from Iowa State. In my opinion he wasn't that bad as everyone thinks. And I believe he could find himself another NBA job somewhere.

What stops us from getting another coach from NCAA? Do they not want to coach in the NBA or just bulls? Is it so much different to coach in ncaa and nba? Are they much worse than current NBA coaches. Or do the bulls only want to hire a finished product coach. What would be the best way to determine what coach would be best for our current roster?

Again, sorry if my questions are stupid or somehow obvious...","NCAA to NBA coach I don't know where else to ask so I'll ask here. Maybe it's a stupid question.

"Our future depends on Lauri, WCJ and this years draft pick. Plain and simple. I like Zach as much as the next guy, but he's more asset than he is a piece for the future (This is my opinion and I'd be more than happy to be wrong, but I just don't see it).

Taj came into this league as an energetic, athletic, defense first power forward with a decent baseline jump shot who could play around the rim without much of a post game...all at the age of 24. Fast forward to today and Taj has developed impeccable foot work in the post, extended his range as a shooter, knows how to use his slender frame to rebound on both ends and is still an excellent defender while entering ""old age"" in the NBA. Taj really has all the intangibles that make him not just a serviceable NBA player, but a player that contending teams want and need.

Lauri and WCJ have more talent now than Taj has ever had, but I worry for their development. If, and I think we will, continue to invest our future in two bigs then we need to surround them with the right complementing veterans who can serve them on the court as well as off the court. Taj is that guy. Not only can Taj serve as a mentor and teacher for our two future bigs, he can still ball and fits in well as a four or small ball five. 

Let's bring 22 back and get these young bigs the coaching and leadership they need. I don't see any better guy than Taj to help in that regard.


Edit: this is all presuming we don‚Äôt extend or match an offer for BP.

"Ok, so from what I can gather, people want everyone fired, even the guys signing checks. Why? 

People wanted the bulls to pick a direction and make a strong move when they had butler. So they made a trade which basically everyone around here agrees was pretty solid, and certainly picked a solid direction. 

After a season of anticipated losses which actually goes on as far as team building; they draft WCJ which people seem to appreciate. Unaware of anyone available at 7 people would prefer. 

They draft hutch which again people seem to appreciate. 

A few weeks into the year, Hoiberg seems to have lost the team, it‚Äôs under performing and the defense is a joke. Offense is decent but not enough seems to be improving. Hoiberg isn‚Äôt really trying new things, just same approach day in and out. 

FO shows it‚Äôs as dissatisfied as everyone else, decides that since hoiberg isn‚Äôt there man, they might as well try something different. They do. It‚Äôs mid season so there‚Äôs not really anything to try other than promoting an assistant. They do. 

He tries to make defense a priority. It fails. He loses the team.

Ok, so Boylen is obviously not a good head coach. So far, the FO has mostly done what people wanted, but now the team is a disaster. 

So what are they supposed to do? If they start grousing now, it‚Äôll only make the franchise look less respectable. They probably are realizing that Dunn may not cut it. What, are they gonna come out and shame him? No, they‚Äôll scout other PGs, yes?

They do make a pretty impressive trade with holiday to get memphis‚Äô next two second rounders, and all signs point to Memphis being a bottom 8 team these next two years. Seriously, making lemons with lemon aid. 

Now hopefully they can find a buyer for RoLo but it‚Äôs gonna be tough. Can‚Äôt have everyone thinking you only make trades which fuck the other franchise, so they do some goodwill with Houston. Now it seems like they might find a way to make a deal with NY, we‚Äôll see. 

I just don‚Äôt see what anyone else would do here.

And here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs weird. 

At the end of the season, the bulls will move on from Boylen. They will get another top 7 pick, hopefully a top 3. 

And then they can move on from the Jabari experiment. They have another off season to try and maybe get a couple vets since they‚Äôll hopefully have rounded out their starting lineup in the draft. 

But if you decide now to invent narratives that Jerry is actually jacking off to bulls fans misery, and that Forman is sitting around planning how to sign Boylen for 5 years and trade Lauri for Houston‚Äôs draft pick, then you‚Äôre just gonna hate all of those guys unnecessarily. 

You can sit around and dream about Paxson wanting to see a team he won a ring for be unable to stay within 20 points of the quest teams. But in the past when the team has looked much better than this he‚Äôs shown he‚Äôs had no patience for this type of BS. So I have no idea why you‚Äôd assume he‚Äôs cool with it now. 

Is there something I‚Äôm missing? Is there something else the FO can do now that it‚Äôs clear Boylen sucks? Is there some other dream scenario that will result in people actually wanting to root for the franchise and now just constantly say any good news is meaningless because Jerry still signs the checks?

Edit - So far, everyone wants the bulls to keep losing and get a draft pick (obvious). 

Not a single person has had a desire of anything happening this year. Some people are actually wanting the bulls to play even worse players to intentionally lose worse then they are. 

So let‚Äôs stop bitching that the FO is evil when they keep doing EXACTLY what everyone e wants. 

If you wanna bitch about these players disappointing, go for it. We all know Boylen sucks, so let‚Äôs let that go as well.

"###The Game
The Pacers played the Bulls at the United Center on Jan 4, 2019, winning 119-116 in overtime.

The Bulls‚Äô core four of Lauri, LaVine, Dunn, and Carter combined for 89 points on 59% shooting. They demonstrated the ability to keep pace against a good team, ultimately falling short but playing pretty damn well in the process. This is the type of game people will point to at the end of the season as a hint to what this core is capable of.

The Pacers entered this matchup as winners of their previous 5 contests. They‚Äôve surprised many with their success thus far this season, nabbing the third seed in the East over the more-acclaimed Sixers and Celtics. They‚Äôve stuck to their identity as an elite defensive team (2nd in DRtg), while on offense, relying on the versatility of their bigs as well as Oladipo‚Äôs playmaking in the pick and roll. As we will see below, the Pacers‚Äô PnR was a problem for the Bulls for the entire game, and it ultimately won the game for the Pacers down the stretch.

Let's get into the details:
###[Pacers PnR Offense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs5WOP34-N0)


The Pacers offense doesn‚Äôt have any spectacular wrinkles. Rather, their offensive success is predicated on the strength of their execution: reading and attacking weak points in the defense, using the shot clock well, quick ball movement, and good spacing.

In this first clip, Oladipo creates the advantage by making quick, decisive moves - first rejecting the pick and roll and losing his defender, then dishing to Sabonis once Wendell Carter commits to him. One of the three Bulls weak-side defenders should probably have helped onto Sabonis (instead of the weak swipe by LaVine to make it an And-1), but the quickness with which the play unfolded plus great spacing by the three Pacers on the weak-side contributed to the lack of help.

The second clip is a great example of the Pacers not doing anything extraordinary with their offense - just being patient and taking advantage of mismatches and defensive mistakes can lead to a wide open bucket. The Bulls switched on ball screens all game, prompting the Pacers to take advantage with their bigs matched up against guards. The Bulls responded by doubling, leading to a game of finding the open man vs. the strength of Bulls rotations and forcing turnovers.

The dynamic interplay between the Pacers' PnR and how the Bulls defended it was a key part of the game down the stretch. More on that later.
###[Bulls PnR Offense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDyBlPcT6Zg)

The Bulls found success in the PnR on their side of the floor. The Pacers defended pick and rolls by trapping / showing hard with the big, relying on help D to cover the roll man. Whenever the Bulls got the ball to the roller, good things tended to happen - especially if the big slipped the screen.

This is a role in which both Bulls bigs can excel: Markkanen with his shooting ability on the pop, Carter Jr. with his playmaking on the roll.

(Very unfortunate that WCJ will be out for the next 2 months, even more so when you realize that Robin Lopez will be starting again.)

The strength of the Pacers‚Äô defense is apparent here - even with the Bulls reading the defense well and attacking weak points, Indiana still manages to contest the shot more often than not.
###[The Bulls' Offensive Stagnation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3qBEQd39rQ)

An area the Bulls struggle with greatly is stagnation. This could stem from a variety of sources - players unsure of their role on the play, a focus on slowing the pace causing players to be lazy on offense, lack of off-ball movement, lack of secondary action if the initial play is shut down, etc. Regardless of the source, this sluggishness is a killer for the Bulls on offense and often endures in long stretches that completely takes them out of the game.

The Bulls were bailed out by LaVine torching the net for 17 points on 6-7 shooting in the first quarter. When LaVine‚Äôs jump shot is falling, he can score with the best of them. However, he still has much room for improvement, specifically regarding his skills as a playmaker.
###[LaVine: Improvements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsT-COT71sM)

LaVine is still unsure of when to attack the defense and when to let up. At times he doesn‚Äôt even look to attack when the opportunity is there, settling for jump shots or letting the defense recover. He needs to improve his ability to read opposing players and make quick, decisive moves to take advantage of weak points in the defense.

Another area of LaVine‚Äôs game he must refine is his finishing game - his 58% shooting at the rim ranked in the 39th percentile among all wings (via Cleaning the Glass). He needs to use his body at the rim to draw contact and shield the ball from defenders. He often relies on his (albeit elite) athleticism to blow by and rise above defenders, resulting in very inconsistent results from close range.

One player LaVine can learn much from is his matchup from this game, [Victor Oladipo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FgFKikKkIU).


Notice how once Oladipo gets even with/past his defender, he doesn‚Äôt continue to accelerate - rather, somewhat counterintuitively, he slows down into the defender, to ensure the defender cannot recover adequately. This also should have been a foul, but he finishes the play anyway. This strategy of leaning into the defender before extending on the layup is known as the [veer finish](https://pickandpop.net/2018/09/veer-finish/) and is practiced widely among NBA guards elite at finishing.
###[Kris Dunn's Playmaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6WM8G8B78k)

Although Kris Dunn is susceptible to long stretches of ineffectiveness on offense, there are games where he puts it all together to great effect, and this was one of those games. He finished with 16 points and 17 assists to only 2 turnovers. Part of his playmaking success is due to his anticipation of defensive rotations as illustrated in the clips above.

***

Decent shotmaking and good execution on the pick and roll, in addition to a big first quarter, was enough for the Bulls to stay in this game all the way to the end. The end of the game is where the Pacers really differentiated themselves as a top team in the east, and would have left the Bulls in the dust if not for some insane shots by LaVine and Markkanen.

This game was chock-full of interesting strategic sequences as well as an exciting finish, and it wouldn‚Äôt be right to leave out an endgame, down-the-stretch analysis. More to come in [part 2](https://bbqchickenbball.wordpress.com/2019/01/22/the-greatest-game-that-no-one-ever-watched-pacers-vs-bulls-part-two/).","If anyone's interested in game breakdowns, here's one I did for the Bulls-Pacers game earlier in the month. ###The Game

"I know that the DSJ for Kris swap has been mentioned, but I'm curious to see as to what everyone else thinks of Dunn's trade value, at the moment, which, admittedly, isn't very high, and as to what and/or who could be had for him in a potential trade.

For example, could you deal him for D'Angelo Russell? My gut says no, but in fairness, neither guy has had their options exercised by their respective teams, so yeah, if that's not realistic, as to what and/or who do you think could Chicago realistically fetch for Kris, and would you go for it? Like, would Dejounte Murray and Quincy Pondexter constitute as being a reasonable haul? Again, my gut says no, but I'm just curious :).","Realistic trades for Dunn I know that the DSJ for Kris swap has been mentioned, but I'm curious to see as to what everyone else thinks of Dunn's trade value, at the moment, which, admittedly, isn't very high, and as to what and/or who could be had for him in a potential trade.

"I see a lot of trade proposals on here that have an end goal of acquiring draft picks. What about a trade that netted us a player for the future that could be a piece to help us move on from the rebuild?

One guy I'd like to see in a Bulls jersey is Justice Winslow. Winslow is only 22 and since Dragic has gone down he has assumed responsibility as a point forward, much like a Simmons, Doncic, LBJ type. He's currently on the books for 13 million per year through 2021 and has a team option for 2022.

The Bulls could offer Kris Dunn, Valentine, and Lopez in exchange for Winslow and Dragic. Picks could also be used to secure the deal.

The Bulls do it to move on from KD before his rookie deal is up. Valentine is a sweetener and Lopez is there to match the salary. Since we are likely guaranteed a top 6 pick in this upcoming draft, adding Winslow, who can play the point or either forward spots would soften the blow if we don't land Zion and offer some interesting scenarios depending on if we take one of the other Duke wings or go after a guy such as Ja Morant.

Miami does it to get out of the tax and out from Dragic's contract where he will almost certainly opt into his 19.2 million deal for next season. Miami could then buy out Lopez and add two younger players as they look forward to the 2021 free agency period. It would also allow Miami to try and move on from some of their other big contracts (Whiteside, Johnson, Olynyk) and tail spin a bit in the 2019-2020 season where they could get a higher draft choice before being players in the following years free agent class.

I have no idea why Miami would do this, it's just wishful thinking for a boring Sunday afternoon, so don't come at me with your pitchforks.

What about you guys? Are there any deals you'd think were possible to acquire a player to add to our young core or do you only care to have draft picks and build from there?","Are there any players currently under contract you'd like to trade for?

"As the Bears recently started winning after several season of losing, I noticed a similarity between the coaching changes between the bears and bulls (I don't know if this has been discussed before).

**Thibs and Lovie**

Both had a lot of success in their jobs, preaching defensive minded style of play, but could never get the team to win a championship. It was probably a good idea to move on from these coaches for both franchises at the time (even though the people who replaced them were worse).

**Hoiberg and Trestman**

After years of defensive minded coaching style, both franchises brought in offensive minded coaches to help bring the team to a new level and both fell flat. Both are very soft spoken, and had some good ideas about how to implement a successful offense, but couldn't handle an NBA or NFL locker room and the teams were never consistent.

**Boylen and Fox**

Fox had the job for 3 years and Boylen has had the job for only a few months but they both have had awful records as head coaches. They both implemented an outdated, archaic offense that was much more common 20 years ago and were very set in their ways. The only real difference is John Fox was a positive influence in the locker room, and the players seem miserable under Jim Boylen.

Hopefully the bulls can get their Matt Nagy soon, but unlike the Bears, the Bulls still have the same front office as they did even before Thibs.","Bears vs. Bulls comparison As the Bears recently started winning after several season of losing, I noticed a similarity between the coaching changes between the bears and bulls (I don't know if this has been discussed before).

"Hey everyone!

I'm a Bulls superfan and I recently created a new blog (The CHICAGO BULLetin) to write about all things Bulls. I just uploaded my first in-depth opinion piece titled, ""A Fan's Honest Assessment of Jim Boylen Thus Far"". I've pasted the TL;DR below, but if you're interested in reading the full post, you can click this link:

[https://chibulletinblog.wixsite.com/bulls/blog/a-fan-s-honest-assessment-of-jim-boylen-thus-far](https://chibulletinblog.wixsite.com/bulls/blog/a-fan-s-honest-assessment-of-jim-boylen-thus-far)

I'd appreciate any feedback! If you enjoyed this piece, be sure to join the mailing list on the website for future content and updates!

**TL;DR:**

Jim Boylen has yet to prove that he‚Äôs an NBA-caliber head coach. Under his leadership, this team appears to have regressed both offensively and defensively. His ‚Äúslow it down‚Äù approach on the offensive end does not fit or function in today‚Äôs NBA. Boylen‚Äôs aim to instill intangibles such as intensity and pride has not actually come to fruition and his slow offense is preventing Lavine and Markkanen from maximizing their ability.

Despite an inconsistent roster (due to injuries and trades), Boylen has often failed to stagger his substitutions, and rolled out reserve lineups that do not provide much on either side of the ball. The constant preaching about being a Popovich disciple and the over-emphasis on developing a ‚Äúroad dog mentality‚Äù are getting old, especially in light of the fact that the Bulls rank amongst the worst in the league on both ends of the floor.

On the plus side, Boylen brings forth a passion for the game and stands up for his players in a way that was sorely missing on the sidelines for the past few years. His resume suggests that he knows what it takes to win, but his know-how would likely be best-utilized in an assistant coaching role.

Perhaps the greatest mistake in this entire Boylen saga is the fact that he was named head coach without ever being given the interim tag. Rather than running a legitimate coaching search (as any responsible organization would do, especially considering the plethora of worthy coaching candidates currently available), the Bulls front office decided to hand over the reigns to an individual that is unproven at the NBA head coaching level. Perhaps this is all in the name of tanking, but it‚Äôs painful to watch nonetheless and Boylen is not the person I would want at the helm of this team going forward.

"I put together an analysis of the individual players' statistics with two goals in mind: 1) see what the differences are between the Hoiberg era and the Boylen era this season, and 2) assess the performance of the players overall this season so far. This is continuation of my analysis of the season statistics so far (see team statistics analysis from two days ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/agteru/analysis_comparing_team_statistics_between/) and an earlier analysis of each player's strong and weak statistical categories [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/a44ygy/analysis_each_players_good_and_bad_statistics/)).

Hopefully the data table is easy to comprehend and pretty much self-explanatory (Link to the screenshots of the data summary also here: [https://imgur.com/gallery/W7585fW](https://imgur.com/gallery/W7585fW)). I'll summarize the main data points for each player below the tables:

**ZACH LAVINE**

***- Hoiberg vs. Boylen era  - main differences***: Zach has been playing less minutes per game under Boylen as expected because of the return of Lauri and Kris. Naturally, his usage is also down a fair amount which also translates into a drop in points per 36 min. His shooting has been more efficient (TS% is up) which is largely because of a dramatic increase in his three point percentage (43.3% Boylen vs. 30.7% Hoiberg). A concerning fact is the big drop in free throws attempted per game which has dropped from 6.8 under Hoiberg to 3.9 under Boylen. Turnovers per 36 min has stayed pretty much the same even with Dunn back and with Zach's usage down which is a bummer.

***- Overall season evaluation:*** He is scoring 24.2 points per 36 min which is pretty good (18th in the NBA with outlier players with low minutes removed). That is 2.2 points higher than last season. His true shooting percentage is decent (55.8%) as is his three point percentage (35.1%). Ideally both of those would be higher for him to elevate himself to the next level. Free throw attempts per game is pretty high (19th in the NBA) and his FT% is great (86.4%) so he has been getting to the line well and then converting those efficiently. The amount of turnovers he has per 36 min (3.7) is concerning - that is higher than last season (2.4). That also means his assist to turnover ratio is not the greatest, ideally that would be much higher. In terms of advanced stats, his defensive rating is fairly poor as is his defensive RPM. His offensive RPM is the best of the team, however, which leads to his overall RPM being ok relative to the rest of the team and the league (taking into account that the Bulls suck which lowers everyone's absolute ratings).

**LAURI MARKKANEN**

***- Hoiberg vs. Boylen era  - main differences***: Not applicable, he only played one game under Hoiberg.

***- Overall season evaluation:*** Lauri's points per 36 min is 19.8 which is an improvement from last season (18.4) so he's moving to the right direction. Ideally you would like to see an even bigger jump but at least he's not completely stagnating yet under this Boylen era. His efficiency has been ok with his true shooting percentage being 54.7% (it was 55.2% last season). You would also like to see that higher for him to really elevate himself to the next level. His three point percentage is 37.9% which again is ok and moving to the right direction (it was 36.2% last season) but obviously not close to elite level yet. His rebounding is pretty good for his position. The amount of assists he has is really lacking, however. I know he is not supposed to be a playmaker but you would like to see a higher number and an assist to turnover ratio of over 1.  In terms of advanced stats, his offensive rating and offensive RPM is team average. His defensive rating is one of the worst in the team but his defensive RPM is one of the best in the team, so not sure what to make of that without having to delve into the nuances of each metric. His net rating is relatively poor as well for what it's worth.

**KRIS DUNN**

***- Hoiberg vs. Boylen era  - main differences***: Not applicable, he only played one game under Hoiberg.

***- Overall season evaluation:*** Kris' point per 36 min is mediocre (14.8 this season vs. 16.5 last season) but his true shooting percentage is bad, only 50.7%. If he can improve his efficiency he should be scoring at a pace expected from a player like him. The amount of three pointers attempted per 36 min is low and hopefully he can confidently increase that. His three point percentage so far is 33.3% which is not half bad if he could maintain that with a higher volume. He is not drawing a huge amount of fouls or shooting free throws for a guard, but those figures are not horrible either. His assists per 36 min is 7.7 which is good. His turnovers have been creeping up though and are close to ""bad"" level, but so far his assist to turnover ratio has been mediocre/decent for a point guard. He has a pretty good amount of steals per 36 min (1.6). He is committing a lot of fouls even for a point guard but luckily that has not seemed to translate into him having to sit out a lot. In terms of advanced stats, surprisingly, his defensive rating is one of the worst of the team which also translates into a relatively bad net rating. His RPM stats are relatively average for this team.

**WENDELL CARTER JR.**

***- Hoiberg vs. Boylen era  - main differences***: Wendell is scoring less under Boylen (13.2 vs. 16.0 points per 36 min) which is a bummer. Then again, that seems to be because his usage is down as his efficiency (TS%) has remained relatively the same. He attempted very few three pointers under Hoiberg and even less under Boylen. His rebounding per 36 min has remained exactly the same but his assist per 36 min and blocks per 36 min have dropped pretty clearly under Boylen. He has committed pretty much the same amount of fouls under both coaches (i.e. a very high amount). His advanced stats have decreased slightly across the board under Boylen.

***- Overall season evaluation:*** His points per 36 min is 14.8 which is pretty good for a rookie in his role and with his usage (he is 10th among rookies - as comparison, Bagley is at 19.6, Ayton is at 19.2, JJJ is at 18.6, and Bamba is at 13.6, but they all have higher usage rates except Bamba, although all of them except Bamba have a higher TS% as well). Wendell's true shooting percentage is 54.1% which is mediocre or perhaps a bit poor for a center (but he is still a rookie). His three point percentage is atrocious (18.8%) and it is pretty clear he has no confidence in that shot at the moment. His free throw percentage is decent (79.5%) so he should have potential to become a competent three point shooter in the future. His rebounding is good but nothing extraordinary for his position (10.0 per 36 min). Even though his blocks are down under Boylen, it is still a pretty nice 1.9 blocks per 36 min. We all know about his foul troubles and that shows - his fouls per 36 min is 4.9 and hopefully he can reduce that a lot during the rest of the season. In terms of advanced stats, his defensive RPM is great and by far the best of the team while his offensive RPM is one of the worst of the team.

**CHANDLER HUTCHISON**

***- Hoiberg vs. Boylen era  - main differences***: On average, Hutch has played pretty much the same amount of minutes per game under both coaches. His points per 36 min have increased by 1.4 points, one of the few players to do so under Boylen. Because his usage has remained at the same level (very low), the increase is explained by his true shooting percentage having improved pretty significantly from 48.3% under Hoiberg to 53.0% under Boylen. His three point attempts per 36 min have remained at the same (low) level but his three point percentage increased by 17.8 percentage points to 36.8%. However, his free throw percentage declined significantly from 65.2% to 44.4%. His free throw attempts per game are down as well so the shooting volumes we are talking about here are low. His rebounding per 36 min has declined pretty clearly under Boylen, but his assist to turnover ratio has clearly improved. In terms of advanced stats, his offensive rating has clearly increased but his defensive rating has decreased by much more which has led to a decline in his net rating compared to the Hoiberg era.

***- Overall season evaluation:*** His points per 36 min is very low at 9.3 points (although as stated above, it has increased under Boylen). His true shooting percentage has improved as well, but because the starting point was at such a low level, his TS% is still a pretty poor 50.7%. His usage percentage is very low with only Archie having a lower usage rate in the team. This is also reflected in the low amount of field goal attempts per 36 min. Three point attempts are low as well and his three point percentage is a poor 27.5% (although it is trending in the right direction as stated above). His free throw percentage is a really bad 59.4% as well. He has also drawn a relatively few number of fouls per 36 min. His rebounding is pretty good for his position and close to ""very good"" level. The amount of assists per 36 min is very low (1.3), especially for a slasher/wing player, but because he has had such a few turnovers (1.0 per 36 min), his assist to turnover ratio is ok. In terms of advanced stats, his offensive, defensive, and net ratings are all near the top tier (but not in the actual top tier) of the team. His defensive RPM is decent relative to this team, but his offensive RPM is bad which means he has a poor overall RPM.

**BOBBY PORTIS**

***- Hoiberg vs. Boylen era  - main differences***: Not applicable, he only played four games under Hoiberg.

***- Overall season evaluation:*** Bobby has only played 14 games this season so it's early to make many even preliminary determinations about his performance. A few stats jump out: his points per 36 min is good at 18.8 points but his efficiency has been really bad at 48.0 TS%. His usage has been relatively high. He has been a very good rebounder with 12.0 rebounds per 36 min. In terms of advanced stats, his offensive rating is one of the best in the team but his defensive rating is atrocious, meaning that his net rating is the worst of the team (if Cam Payne is excluded).

**RYAN ARCIDIACONO**

***- Hoiberg vs. Boylen era  - main differences***: His points per 36 min is way down (-3.6 point difference) compared to Hoiberg era. His usage has declined a bit as well from already very low levels under Hoiberg, but the main reason for the drop in scoring is the big decline in efficiency as his true shooting percentage dropped by 9.6 percentage points to 53.7% under Boylen. His three point attempts per game are clearly down, and even more significantly, his three point percentage has dropped from the great 42.9% under Hoiberg to bad 28.9% under Boylen. Interestingly, his free throw percentage has actually increased by 15 percentage points. Assists and turnovers per 36 min have remained pretty much unchanged which means that he has retained his great assist to turnover ratio under Boylen. He has also slightly increased the number of steals per 36 min under Boylen. In terms of advanced stats, his offensive, defensive, and net ratings all relatively declined compared to the Hoiberg era, but because most players' ratings have decreased as well, he is still near the top of the team in these categories.

***- Overall season evaluation:*** Archie's points per 36 min is very low at 8.6 points. His usage is also extremely low (only 10.1%). His true shooting percentage is still really good at 59.7% even though it has dropped under Boylen. The same is true with his three point percentage which is still a pretty solid 38.5% even though it has decreased under Boylen as well. Archie is the best free throw shooter of the team at 88.4% (Holiday was slightly better when he was here). The amount of assists per 36 min is decent but not great for a point guard at 4.8, but because his turnovers are so low, his assist to turnover ratio is a truly great 4.2 which is the third highest in the NBA. In terms of advanced stats, Ryan has a relatively great offensive rating (the second best in the team) and is close to the top tier of the team in the defensive rating as well which means that he has the second best net rating of the team (the first is Lopez). ESPN's RPM statistics truly love him as well - he is the only Bulls player with both positive offensive and defensive RPM values which means that he has by far the best overall RPM value of the whole team.

**JABARI PARKER**

***- Hoiberg vs. Boylen era  - main differences***: As expected, Jabari's minutes per game are significantly down and are at 18.9 minutes per game under Boylen. His points per 36 min have increased slightly. His true shooting percentage has improved by a solid 3.6 percentage points under Boylen (55.8 TS% under Boylen). His usage has been basically the same. He has attempted fewer three pointers per 36 min (as has the whole team under Boylen) but his three point percentage has improved greatly from 29.5% under Hoiberg to 42.9% under Boylen. He has drawn clearly fewer fouls per 36 min under Boylen while his rebounding has remained the same. He has increased his assists per 36 min. In terms of advanced stats, given the above improvements, it is a bit surprising that his offensive, defensive, and net ratings are all clearly down under Boylen compared to the Hoiberg era.

***- Overall season evaluation:*** Jabari has a good 18.8 points per 36 min. His true shooting percentage is a very mediocre (and almost bad) 52.8%. Likewise, his three point percentage stands at a very mediocre and almost bad 31.4% (but as stated above, his shooting has been clearly better under Boylen). His rebounding is good but not remarkable for a player in his position at 8.3 rebounds per 36 min. His assists per 36 min is mediocre but his turnovers per 36 min is poor at 3.0 which means that his assist to turnover ratio is below 1 and therefore poor. In terms of advanced stats, his offensive, defensive (and therefore net) ratings are around team average. However, the RPM metric really does not like Jabari as he has both a relatively poor offensive and defensive RPM which means that his total RPM is the second worst of the team and one of the worst in the NBA (only Blakeney has a worse total RPM in the team).

**OTHER PLAYERS**

Because this post is already super long, I am just going to mention a few key things about the rest of the players who very likely won't be a part of the Bulls' long-term future.

\-  **Shaq Harrison's** true shooting percentage is a truly atrocious 45.9%. His steals per 36 min figure is great (2.6) which is top tier in the NBA. As expected, his offensive rating is by far the team's worst but his defensive rating is the second best in the team (only Lopez is better).

\- Speaking of **Rolo**, his traditional stats are very middle of the road across the board, no significant highs or lows. Only his turnovers (and therefore his assist to turnover ratio) is relatively poor while his blocks per 36 min is pretty decent. Advanced stats really like Rolo though because he has the best defensive rating of the team and also the best net rating of the team. His defensive RPM is also very good relative to the rest of the team. His offensive RPM is the worst of the team, however.

\- **Blakeney** has 19.7 points per 36 min which is nice but it really is only because his usage rate is so high at 24.7%. His true shooting percentage is poor at 50.9% (i.e., he truly is a chucker). Interestingly, his three point percentage is really, really good at 45.7% (the best in the team) which means that he is extremely inefficient with his mid-range 2 pointers. Also, his assists per 36 min is super low for a guard which means that his assist to turnover ratio is bad. The RPM metric hates him as he has poor offensive and defensive RPMs and his overall RPM is very bad (the 7th worst in the NBA - Collin Sexton has the worst).

\- **Felicio**. Shrek. Not really interested in saying anything about him, he hasn't played much. His TS% is pretty nice though even after taking into account that centers usually have a better TS%.

\- **Holiday** is gone so I'm not really interested in talking about him. But you can see the dramatic decline in his shooting when comparing the Hoiberg era to the Boylen era.

\- **Cam Payne** is gone. All hail Cam Payne. And he was bad. His TS% was really bad. And he had by far the worst net rating of any player in the team.

\- **Rawle Alkins** or **Wayne Selden** haven't played enough to really say anything about them.

That's it. If you read this far, you are crazy but I appreciate you.","Player Statistics Analysis - Hoiberg vs. Boylen Eras & Season So Far I put together an analysis of the individual players' statistics with two goals in mind: 1) see what the differences are between the Hoiberg era and the Boylen era this season, and 2) assess the performance of the players overall this season so far. This is continuation of my analysis of the season statistics so far (see team statistics analysis from two days ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/agteru/analysis_comparing_team_statistics_between/) and an earlier analysis of each player's strong and weak statistical categories [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/a44ygy/analysis_each_players_good_and_bad_statistics/)).

Hopefully the data table is easy to comprehend and pretty much self-explanatory (Link to the screenshots of the data summary also here: [https://imgur.com/gallery/W7585fW](https://imgur.com/gallery/W7585fW)). I'll summarize the main data points for each player below the tables:

**ZACH LAVINE**

***- Hoiberg vs. Boylen era  - main differences***: Zach has been playing less minutes per game under Boylen as expected because of the return of Lauri and Kris. Naturally, his usage is also down a fair amount which also translates into a drop in points per 36 min. His shooting has been more efficient (TS% is up) which is largely because of a dramatic increase in his three point percentage (43.3% Boylen vs. 30.7% Hoiberg). A concerning fact is the big drop in free throws attempted per game which has dropped from 6.8 under Hoiberg to 3.9 under Boylen. Turnovers per 36 min has stayed pretty much the same even with Dunn back and with Zach's usage down which is a bummer.

***- Overall season evaluation:*** He is scoring 24.2 points per 36 min which is pretty good (18th in the NBA with outlier players with low minutes removed). That is 2.2 points higher than last season. His true shooting percentage is decent (55.8%) as is his three point percentage (35.1%). Ideally both of those would be higher for him to elevate himself to the next level. Free throw attempts per game is pretty high (19th in the NBA) and his FT% is great (86.4%) so he has been getting to the line well and then converting those efficiently. The amount of turnovers he has per 36 min (3.7) is concerning - that is higher than last season (2.4). That also means his assist to turnover ratio is not the greatest, ideally that would be much higher. In terms of advanced stats, his defensive rating is fairly poor as is his defensive RPM. His offensive RPM is the best of the team, however, which leads to his overall RPM being ok relative to the rest of the team and the league (taking into account that the Bulls suck which lowers everyone's absolute ratings).

**LAURI MARKKANEN**

***- Hoiberg vs. Boylen era  - main differences***: Not applicable, he only played one game under Hoiberg.

***- Overall season evaluation:*** Lauri's points per 36 min is 19.8 which is an improvement from last season (18.4) so he's moving to the right direction. Ideally you would like to see an even bigger jump but at least he's not completely stagnating yet under this Boylen era. His efficiency has been ok with his true shooting percentage being 54.7% (it was 55.2% last season). You would also like to see that higher for him to really elevate himself to the next level. His three point percentage is 37.9% which again is ok and moving to the right direction (it was 36.2% last season) but obviously not close to elite level yet. His rebounding is pretty good for his position. The amount of assists he has is really lacking, however. I know he is not supposed to be a playmaker but you would like to see a higher number and an assist to turnover ratio of over 1.  In terms of advanced stats, his offensive rating and offensive RPM is team average. His defensive rating is one of the worst in the team but his defensive RPM is one of the best in the team, so not sure what to make of that without having to delve into the nuances of each metric. His net rating is relatively poor as well for what it's worth.

**KRIS DUNN**

***- Hoiberg vs. Boylen era  - main differences***: Not applicable, he only played one game under Hoiberg.

***- Overall season evaluation:*** Kris' point per 36 min is mediocre (14.8 this season vs. 16.5 last season) but his true shooting percentage is bad, only 50.7%. If he can improve his efficiency he should be scoring at a pace expected from a player like him. The amount of three pointers attempted per 36 min is low and hopefully he can confidently increase that. His three point percentage so far is 33.3% which is not half bad if he could maintain that with a higher volume. He is not drawing a huge amount of fouls or shooting free throws for a guard, but those figures are not horrible either. His assists per 36 min is 7.7 which is good. His turnovers have been creeping up though and are close to ""bad"" level, but so far his assist to turnover ratio has been mediocre/decent for a point guard. He has a pretty good amount of steals per 36 min (1.6). He is committing a lot of fouls even for a point guard but luckily that has not seemed to translate into him having to sit out a lot. In terms of advanced stats, surprisingly, his defensive rating is one of the worst of the team which also translates into a relatively bad net rating. His RPM stats are relatively average for this team.

**WENDELL CARTER JR.**

***- Hoiberg vs. Boylen era  - main differences***: Wendell is scoring less under Boylen (13.2 vs. 16.0 points per 36 min) which is a bummer. Then again, that seems to be because his usage is down as his efficiency (TS%) has remained relatively the same. He attempted very few three pointers under Hoiberg and even less under Boylen. His rebounding per 36 min has remained exactly the same but his assist per 36 min and blocks per 36 min have dropped pretty clearly under Boylen. He has committed pretty much the same amount of fouls under both coaches (i.e. a very high amount). His advanced stats have decreased slightly across the board under Boylen.

***- Overall season evaluation:*** His points per 36 min is 14.8 which is pretty good for a rookie in his role and with his usage (he is 10th among rookies - as comparison, Bagley is at 19.6, Ayton is at 19.2, JJJ is at 18.6, and Bamba is at 13.6, but they all have higher usage rates except Bamba, although all of them except Bamba have a higher TS% as well). Wendell's true shooting percentage is 54.1% which is mediocre or perhaps a bit poor for a center (but he is still a rookie). His three point percentage is atrocious (18.8%) and it is pretty clear he has no confidence in that shot at the moment. His free throw percentage is decent (79.5%) so he should have potential to become a competent three point shooter in the future. His rebounding is good but nothing extraordinary for his position (10.0 per 36 min). Even though his blocks are down under Boylen, it is still a pretty nice 1.9 blocks per 36 min. We all know about his foul troubles and that shows - his fouls per 36 min is 4.9 and hopefully he can reduce that a lot during the rest of the season. In terms of advanced stats, his defensive RPM is great and by far the best of the team while his offensive RPM is one of the worst of the team.

**CHANDLER HUTCHISON**

***- Hoiberg vs. Boylen era  - main differences***: On average, Hutch has played pretty much the same amount of minutes per game under both coaches. His points per 36 min have increased by 1.4 points, one of the few players to do so under Boylen. Because his usage has remained at the same level (very low), the increase is explained by his true shooting percentage having improved pretty significantly from 48.3% under Hoiberg to 53.0% under Boylen. His three point attempts per 36 min have remained at the same (low) level but his three point percentage increased by 17.8 percentage points to 36.8%. However, his free throw percentage declined significantly from 65.2% to 44.4%. His free throw attempts per game are down as well so the shooting volumes we are talking about here are low. His rebounding per 36 min has declined pretty clearly under Boylen, but his assist to turnover ratio has clearly improved. In terms of advanced stats, his offensive rating has clearly increased but his defensive rating has decreased by much more which has led to a decline in his net rating compared to the Hoiberg era.

***- Overall season evaluation:*** His points per 36 min is very low at 9.3 points (although as stated above, it has increased under Boylen). His true shooting percentage has improved as well, but because the starting point was at such a low level, his TS% is still a pretty poor 50.7%. His usage percentage is very low with only Archie having a lower usage rate in the team. This is also reflected in the low amount of field goal attempts per 36 min. Three point attempts are low as well and his three point percentage is a poor 27.5% (although it is trending in the right direction as stated above). His free throw percentage is a really bad 59.4% as well. He has also drawn a relatively few number of fouls per 36 min. His rebounding is pretty good for his position and close to ""very good"" level. The amount of assists per 36 min is very low (1.3), especially for a slasher/wing player, but because he has had such a few turnovers (1.0 per 36 min), his assist to turnover ratio is ok. In terms of advanced stats, his offensive, defensive, and net ratings are all near the top tier (but not in the actual top tier) of the team. His defensive RPM is decent relative to this team, but his offensive RPM is bad which means he has a poor overall RPM.

**BOBBY PORTIS**

***- Hoiberg vs. Boylen era  - main differences***: Not applicable, he only played four games under Hoiberg.

***- Overall season evaluation:*** Bobby has only played 14 games this season so it's early to make many even preliminary determinations about his performance. A few stats jump out: his points per 36 min is good at 18.8 points but his efficiency has been really bad at 48.0 TS%. His usage has been relatively high. He has been a very good rebounder with 12.0 rebounds per 36 min. In terms of advanced stats, his offensive rating is one of the best in the team but his defensive rating is atrocious, meaning that his net rating is the worst of the team (if Cam Payne is excluded).

**RYAN ARCIDIACONO**

***- Hoiberg vs. Boylen era  - main differences***: His points per 36 min is way down (-3.6 point difference) compared to Hoiberg era. His usage has declined a bit as well from already very low levels under Hoiberg, but the main reason for the drop in scoring is the big decline in efficiency as his true shooting percentage dropped by 9.6 percentage points to 53.7% under Boylen. His three point attempts per game are clearly down, and even more significantly, his three point percentage has dropped from the great 42.9% under Hoiberg to bad 28.9% under Boylen. Interestingly, his free throw percentage has actually increased by 15 percentage points. Assists and turnovers per 36 min have remained pretty much unchanged which means that he has retained his great assist to turnover ratio under Boylen. He has also slightly increased the number of steals per 36 min under Boylen. In terms of advanced stats, his offensive, defensive, and net ratings all relatively declined compared to the Hoiberg era, but because most players' ratings have decreased as well, he is still near the top of the team in these categories.

***- Overall season evaluation:*** Archie's points per 36 min is very low at 8.6 points. His usage is also extremely low (only 10.1%). His true shooting percentage is still really good at 59.7% even though it has dropped under Boylen. The same is true with his three point percentage which is still a pretty solid 38.5% even though it has decreased under Boylen as well. Archie is the best free throw shooter of the team at 88.4% (Holiday was slightly better when he was here). The amount of assists per 36 min is decent but not great for a point guard at 4.8, but because his turnovers are so low, his assist to turnover ratio is a truly great 4.2 which is the third highest in the NBA. In terms of advanced stats, Ryan has a relatively great offensive rating (the second best in the team) and is close to the top tier of the team in the defensive rating as well which means that he has the second best net rating of the team (the first is Lopez). ESPN's RPM statistics truly love him as well - he is the only Bulls player with both positive offensive and defensive RPM values which means that he has by far the best overall RPM value of the whole team.

**JABARI PARKER**

***- Hoiberg vs. Boylen era  - main differences***: As expected, Jabari's minutes per game are significantly down and are at 18.9 minutes per game under Boylen. His points per 36 min have increased slightly. His true shooting percentage has improved by a solid 3.6 percentage points under Boylen (55.8 TS% under Boylen). His usage has been basically the same. He has attempted fewer three pointers per 36 min (as has the whole team under Boylen) but his three point percentage has improved greatly from 29.5% under Hoiberg to 42.9% under Boylen. He has drawn clearly fewer fouls per 36 min under Boylen while his rebounding has remained the same. He has increased his assists per 36 min. In terms of advanced stats, given the above improvements, it is a bit surprising that his offensive, defensive, and net ratings are all clearly down under Boylen compared to the Hoiberg era.

***- Overall season evaluation:*** Jabari has a good 18.8 points per 36 min. His true shooting percentage is a very mediocre (and almost bad) 52.8%. Likewise, his three point percentage stands at a very mediocre and almost bad 31.4% (but as stated above, his shooting has been clearly better under Boylen). His rebounding is good but not remarkable for a player in his position at 8.3 rebounds per 36 min. His assists per 36 min is mediocre but his turnovers per 36 min is poor at 3.0 which means that his assist to turnover ratio is below 1 and therefore poor. In terms of advanced stats, his offensive, defensive (and therefore net) ratings are around team average. However, the RPM metric really does not like Jabari as he has both a relatively poor offensive and defensive RPM which means that his total RPM is the second worst of the team and one of the worst in the NBA (only Blakeney has a worse total RPM in the team).

**OTHER PLAYERS**

Because this post is already super long, I am just going to mention a few key things about the rest of the players who very likely won't be a part of the Bulls' long-term future.

\-  **Shaq Harrison's** true shooting percentage is a truly atrocious 45.9%. His steals per 36 min figure is great (2.6) which is top tier in the NBA. As expected, his offensive rating is by far the team's worst but his defensive rating is the second best in the team (only Lopez is better).

\- Speaking of **Rolo**, his traditional stats are very middle of the road across the board, no significant highs or lows. Only his turnovers (and therefore his assist to turnover ratio) is relatively poor while his blocks per 36 min is pretty decent. Advanced stats really like Rolo though because he has the best defensive rating of the team and also the best net rating of the team. His defensive RPM is also very good relative to the rest of the team. His offensive RPM is the worst of the team, however.

\- **Blakeney** has 19.7 points per 36 min which is nice but it really is only because his usage rate is so high at 24.7%. His true shooting percentage is poor at 50.9% (i.e., he truly is a chucker). Interestingly, his three point percentage is really, really good at 45.7% (the best in the team) which means that he is extremely inefficient with his mid-range 2 pointers. Also, his assists per 36 min is super low for a guard which means that his assist to turnover ratio is bad. The RPM metric hates him as he has poor offensive and defensive RPMs and his overall RPM is very bad (the 7th worst in the NBA - Collin Sexton has the worst).

\- **Felicio**. Shrek. Not really interested in saying anything about him, he hasn't played much. His TS% is pretty nice though even after taking into account that centers usually have a better TS%.

\- **Holiday** is gone so I'm not really interested in talking about him. But you can see the dramatic decline in his shooting when comparing the Hoiberg era to the Boylen era.

\- **Cam Payne** is gone. All hail Cam Payne. And he was bad. His TS% was really bad. And he had by far the worst net rating of any player in the team.

\- **Rawle Alkins** or **Wayne Selden** haven't played enough to really say anything about them.

"**LINK TO THE STATISTICS**: [https://imgur.com/gallery/XbRCUtP](https://imgur.com/gallery/XbRCUtP)

It has been slow at work, so I created a spreadsheet that compares all the team statistics between games played under Hoiberg and Boylen so far this season. All the statistics come from stats.nba.com. I figured the easiest way to share the stats would be to pdf the Excel and then take a screenshot of it.

Hopefully you guys find this interesting, I know I did while working on this. Everyone can take a look at the stats themselves but below is a brief summary on the main points. Of course, we need to remember that Hoiberg‚Äôs firing happened right around the time when Lauri and Kris came back so the differences in stats cannot be solely attributed to coaching differences (i.e. not a pure apples to apples comparison) because of the differences in the available roster. Still, I think the comparison is pretty revealing.

\- Interestingly, the offensive and defensive ratings (and team rankings) are very similar between Hoiberg and Boylen. There was a larger difference earlier in the Boylen era, but the defense has got worse as time has passed while the offense has remained atrocious. Both ratings are actually slightly worse under Boylen (even though we got Dunn and Lauri back), but overall, we are ranked similarly under both coaches compared to the rest of the NBA.

\- As we all know since this has been discussed widely, but the difference in pace is very significant. Hoiberg‚Äôs Bulls were at the middle of the pack in pace while Boylen‚Äôs Bulls are 26th (we are a fraction ahead of the Magic, the Cavs, and the Heat with Memphis further back). Because the pace is down and offensive rating is roughly the same, it follows that points made per game is down. To offer some perspective, we are down 17 points compared to the Kings, 15 points compared to the Hawks, and 11 points compared to the Suns.

\- Another dramatic difference is in the decline in three point attempts. We are now dead last in three point attempts in the NBA and second to last in three pointers made. The three point percentage actually increased, probably because we are taking less contested/bad three pointers (because we are taking them less overall). Three point attempts make only 27.3 percent of all field goal attempts under Boylen which also puts us dead last in the NBA.

\- Another significant change is in the relative share of how we are scoring our points under Boylen. The relative share of three pointers, free throws, and mid-range two pointers are all down while the share of points made in the paint has increased dramatically. Under Boylen we have made exactly 50 percent of our points in the paint which puts us second in the NBA.

\- In terms or rebounding, we have improved our offensive rebounding under Boylen (not hard because we were dead last in the NBA under Hoiberg) but we are still only 28th. However, we have got worse in defensive rebounding so the overall effect on total rebounding is pretty much a wash. We are still one of the worst rebounding teams in the NBA so no change there.

\- Under Boylen, blocks are slightly down while steals are slightly up. True shooting percentage is slightly down.

\- Another significant difference between Bulls under Hoiberg and Bulls under Boylen is that assists are way down under Boylen. We dropped in assist percentage (percentage of field goals that have an assist) from 17th in the NBA to 28th. At the same time, turnovers are up (even though the pace is way down) and we are 28th in turnover percentage under Boylen (i.e. third worst). This means that assist to turnover ratio has obviously declined as well and we have been the second worst in the NBA in that statistic under Boylen.

\- Personal fouls drawn are down although we were already second to last under Hoiberg already. This also translates to less free throw attempts per game under Boylen, we are last in the NBA during his tenure.

\- Another well discussed issue has been the decline in fast breaks and that is also evident in the statistics. Fast break points made per game has clearly declined under Boylen (26th in the NBA). If pace is taken into account by looking at the percentage of fast break points out of total points made, that has declined as well and we have been 22nd in the NBA under Boylen‚Äôs tenure (that is actually higher than I expected).

\- In terms of allowing second chance points, fast break points, or points off turnovers, they have remained nearly identical under Boylen compared to Hoiberg, so the ‚Äúroad dog mentality‚Äù is not really visible there. However, there has been a fairly clear change in points allowed in the paint ‚Äì we have allowed the 8th least in the NBA under Boylen whereas we were 14th under Hoiberg. That would suggest to me that we are clogging up the paint more but just based on the eye test, this has led to teams being more open at the three point line. But I have no statistics on that.

Overall, there are no huge surprises given what the Bulls fans and media have already discussed a lot since Boylen took over. Still, what surprised me personally was just how much we have emphasized scoring points in the paint compared to all the other ways to score.

Also, overall, there is way more ‚Äúred‚Äù than ‚Äúgreen‚Äù numbers which means that most of these statistics have declined/got worse under Boylen. Some of those changes have been relatively minor while some have been more dramatic. But it‚Äôs hard to point to any statistic that shows clear improvement under Boylen even though he has had better players available than Hoiberg. I am going to stay diplomatic in this post so that's all I'm going to say about that.","Analysis - Comparing Team Statistics Between Hoiberg and Boylen **LINK TO THE STATISTICS**: [https://imgur.com/gallery/XbRCUtP](https://imgur.com/gallery/XbRCUtP)

"Despite the report that Boylen received a pay raise, I still think there's a strong possibility that the front office will find a new head coach in the offseason because the results so far under Boylen both outcome-wise and player development wise have been absolutely horrendous in my opinion. As a result I decided to take a look at potential coaching candidates and put together a list of people that seemed intriguing to me. There was a thread a couple of days ago about coaching candidates, I still want to address some of the popular names in that thread, but to avoid a complete rehash, I took a look at some candidates that flew under the radar as well. 
Edit: If anyone has any other suggestions that strike me as interesting, I'll try to update the list to do more evaluations on candidates


**Chris Finch** - Finch is currently an assistant coach with the New Orleans Pelicans and is one of my favorite candidates if we are able to get him. I want to preface this by saying that Finch joining the Bulls is probably unlikely because the Raptors also requested an interview with him in the offseason and the Pelicans refused to give permission. That said, with the Pels were coming off a strong playoff run and probably valued their coaching more, whereas now it seems like they could genuinely miss the playoffs altogether. The reason why Finch excites me as a potential candidate is because prior to being with the Pelicans, he was an assistant coach for the Nuggets and worked with Nikola Jokic, and with the Pels he obviously worked with Davis and Cousins. He's widely regarded as a very offensive minded coach whereas Malone is from the Pop coaching tree so is likely more defensive minded, what this means is that Finch probably played a very key role in the Jokic centric Nuggets offense and was probably very influential in crafting the offense that got the Pels to the conference semis last year. Having an offensive centric coach that worked with some of the best big men in the league could be an excellent situation for Lauri and Wendell as I think Boylen has colossally failed to utilize the versatility that they both possess. Even better, Finch was an assistant under D'antoni in Houston which means he has experience being a part of the epitome of a modern offense and has worked with James Harden. Going over some of his interviews my key takeaways were that despite his offensive minded reputation, he values defense very highly, he values pace and running a modern nba offense, he values versatility and freedom of play within a designed system (very golden state esque), but also not giving up basic defensive principles and good shots in favor of overarching modern offensive principles. Despite the big names that have been floated, if I were GarPax, I would be taking a long hard look at Chris Finch.


**Chris Fleming**- Fleming is a current assistant coach for the Brooklyn Nets. Fleming has a long coaching background in Europe and was the coach of the German national team for a few years. Per ESPN's Kevin Arnovitz ""he has a versatile skill set as an X's and O's maven who isn't afraid to get his hands dirty on the court developing talent"". This backs up the idea that in general in European coaching, gameplan creativity reigns supreme. As a member of the Nets, Fleming has experience working with - in my opinion one of the most underrated coaches in the league in Kenny Atkinson. Whats more is that Atkinson is known for his player development and if Fleming has picked up on that ability, it bodes very well for our young roster. The Nets have done a pretty good job this season considering their roster and the injuries they've been through (sitting at almost .500) and have done an excellent job developing Jarrett Allen, D'angelo Russell, and Spencer Dinwiddie. Fleming could be the perfect coach for a young developing team like the Bulls. 


**Johnnie Bryant**- Bryant is a current assistant for the Utah Jazz. This is probably a long shot since Bryant is only 32, however he has one of the best player development reputations in the NBA. Gordon Hayward widely credited him for developing him into an all star, he also worked closely with Damian Lillard and Paul Millsap and is currently working with Donovan Mitchell. Lillard also speaks incredibly highly of Bryant. Bryant works closely with players and crafts individual personalized development paths to make sure they succeed and gets on the court with every player on the roster. He would also be coming from the Quinn Snyder coaching tree which is a huge plus since Snyder is regarded as one of the best coaches in the game. Bryant is an intriguing prospect because for a lot of our young guys he could be the best case scenario in terms of pure development, that said his youth could indicate that when it comes to the X's and O's he may not be ready to be a head coach yet. That said he's known for watching a ton of film and breaking down games in detail so you never know if he could end up being a future COTY candidate. 


**David Adelman**- Adelman is a current assistant coach for the Denver Nuggets and son of coaching legend Rick Adelman. Again, I think getting a coach who has experience with big men is a big plus for this team. Adelman obviously works with Jokic, but also was an assistant for Minnesota for 3 years working with Towns. Another thing I like about Adelman was that prior to being an assistant coach, he worked in player development which is obviously the foremost priority for the Bulls. That said, I couldn't find anything on Adelman in terms of coaching philosophy, but his experience and hiring by one of the most competent front offices in the league makes him a candidate that deserves a look. 


**David Vanterpool**- Vanterpool is currently an assistant for the Portland Trail Blazers. Vanterpool is already receiving a lot of buzz about his potential as a head coach and interviewed in the offseason for multiple open head coaching positions. Both Lillard and McCollum speak highly of him in terms of their development on both ends of the floor, something that I think bodes well for Dunn and Lavine in terms of development. Again in terms of coaching philosophy it was very difficult to find stuff, but my general sense was that he's a very hands on coach, which bodes well for player development. Apparently he also works with Boylen on the Canadian National Team staff, I firmly believe we would be getting the better half of that duo.


**Nate Tibbetts**- Tibbetts is another Blazers assistant coach and has been with the team for 5 years and has head coaching experience in the g-league prior to that (where he was very successful). Tibbetts also interviewed for multiple head coaching gigs this offseason and is widely considered to be an inevitable head coach in the league. Again in terms of philosophy it was hard to find anything on Tibbetts except again he has a stellar reputation. I should add that for both Vanterpool and Tibbetts, Terry Stotts (the current head coach of the Blazers), has been regarded as one of the best coaches in the league and blazers have had a lot of success over the past few years despite last year's playoffs collapse. If the belief that behind a good head coach are good assistant coaches, getting one of Tibbetts or Vanterpool could be fantastic.


**Jay Larranaga**- Larranaga is the top assistant for the Boston Celtics right now. Larranage has a player history in Europe and has head coaching experience in the G-League. Brad Stevens offered a strong endorsement specifically for Larranaga's player development ability. Considering how successful the Celtics have been in that department, if there's truth to Stevens' endorsement, Larranaga could be a great pickup. He's regarded for his knowledge on running a modern offense and given Stevens' reputation as a great defensive mind, Larranaga could be a great coach on both ends of the floor by learning from Stevens. He's also interviewed for multiple head coaching vacancies and is seen as another inevitable head coach. 


**Jerry Stackhouse**- As Stackhouse is fairly well known and was mentioned in the other thread I was talking about, I'll go over him fairly quickly. Stackhouse is a current Grizzlies assistant coach and previously led the Raptors 905 to a G-League title. He's known for his defensive prowess, emphasis on player readiness and overall hard work, practice driven approach. He interviewed for multiple jobs in the offseason and is another inevitable head coach. Would be a fantastic pick up no doubt as succeeding as much as he did in the G-league doesn't happen without good coaching acumen.


**Becky Hammon**- Current assistant for the San Antonio Spurs and has coached the Spurs summer team. Again she is a very popular candidate so I don't want to rehash too much, but she's very well regarded and has a ringing endorsement from Pop as well as Spurs players (with Pau even writing an article in favor of her). Would likely be a great pickup. 


**Ettore Messina**- Again a popular candidate and assistant for the Spurs. Has a strong belief and experience in running a motion offense, is the top assistant for the Spurs and has experience in Europe as well. Would be a great pickup as well. 

**Dave Joerger**-  Thanks to u/chiroc7 for the suggestion. I wasn't aware of this but apparently despite the season the kings are having, Joerger could be in the hot seat due to a poor relationship with the front office. Joerger has a lot of coaching experience having also served as the head coach of the Memphis Grizzlies. Joerger had two 50 win seasons with the Grizzlies and was considered a defensive specialist. What's interesting is that the kings have come out of nowhere this season not because of defense but because of their offensive gameplan. They are running teams off the floor with their fast transition game and look like a prototype for a modern offense. It's very encouraging that a defensive minded coach from an old school team like the Grizzlies has reinvented the Kings offense. I doubt Joerger leaves after the season he's having but since Bud left Atlanta I guess anything can happen when a FO and coach don't get along. 

**David Blatt**-  Thanks to u/JohnSkippersSugarJar for the suggestion. Blatt has a long history of enormous success as a head coach. He's coached the Russian national team, won EuroLeague coach of the year, and despite widely held beliefs his tenure record wise was very successful in Cleveland. The Cavs went to the finals with him as head coach and won 2 games depleted without Kyrie and Kevin Love. It's unclear why Blatt was fired but if it's because his affinity for X's and O's got in the way of what could have been a simple drive and kick offense under James, then that bodes pretty well for a team looking to hire Blatt, especially one that needs more offensive versatility. Given that European assistant coaches have become a mainstay in the NBA by now, it may be a long shot to go with Blatt as opposed to an assistant with multiple years of NBA experience, but it can very easily be argued that one year in the NBA with a finals run dwarfs a decade as an assistant in the NBA.","A look at potential coaching candidates Despite the report that Boylen received a pay raise, I still think there's a strong possibility that the front office will find a new head coach in the offseason because the results so far under Boylen both outcome-wise and player development wise have been absolutely horrendous in my opinion. As a result I decided to take a look at potential coaching candidates and put together a list of people that seemed intriguing to me. There was a thread a couple of days ago about coaching candidates, I still want to address some of the popular names in that thread, but to avoid a complete rehash, I took a look at some candidates that flew under the radar as well. 
Edit: If anyone has any other suggestions that strike me as interesting, I'll try to update the list to do more evaluations on candidates


**Chris Finch** - Finch is currently an assistant coach with the New Orleans Pelicans and is one of my favorite candidates if we are able to get him. I want to preface this by saying that Finch joining the Bulls is probably unlikely because the Raptors also requested an interview with him in the offseason and the Pelicans refused to give permission. That said, with the Pels were coming off a strong playoff run and probably valued their coaching more, whereas now it seems like they could genuinely miss the playoffs altogether. The reason why Finch excites me as a potential candidate is because prior to being with the Pelicans, he was an assistant coach for the Nuggets and worked with Nikola Jokic, and with the Pels he obviously worked with Davis and Cousins. He's widely regarded as a very offensive minded coach whereas Malone is from the Pop coaching tree so is likely more defensive minded, what this means is that Finch probably played a very key role in the Jokic centric Nuggets offense and was probably very influential in crafting the offense that got the Pels to the conference semis last year. Having an offensive centric coach that worked with some of the best big men in the league could be an excellent situation for Lauri and Wendell as I think Boylen has colossally failed to utilize the versatility that they both possess. Even better, Finch was an assistant under D'antoni in Houston which means he has experience being a part of the epitome of a modern offense and has worked with James Harden. Going over some of his interviews my key takeaways were that despite his offensive minded reputation, he values defense very highly, he values pace and running a modern nba offense, he values versatility and freedom of play within a designed system (very golden state esque), but also not giving up basic defensive principles and good shots in favor of overarching modern offensive principles. Despite the big names that have been floated, if I were GarPax, I would be taking a long hard look at Chris Finch.


**Chris Fleming**- Fleming is a current assistant coach for the Brooklyn Nets. Fleming has a long coaching background in Europe and was the coach of the German national team for a few years. Per ESPN's Kevin Arnovitz ""he has a versatile skill set as an X's and O's maven who isn't afraid to get his hands dirty on the court developing talent"". This backs up the idea that in general in European coaching, gameplan creativity reigns supreme. As a member of the Nets, Fleming has experience working with - in my opinion one of the most underrated coaches in the league in Kenny Atkinson. Whats more is that Atkinson is known for his player development and if Fleming has picked up on that ability, it bodes very well for our young roster. The Nets have done a pretty good job this season considering their roster and the injuries they've been through (sitting at almost .500) and have done an excellent job developing Jarrett Allen, D'angelo Russell, and Spencer Dinwiddie. Fleming could be the perfect coach for a young developing team like the Bulls. 


**Johnnie Bryant**- Bryant is a current assistant for the Utah Jazz. This is probably a long shot since Bryant is only 32, however he has one of the best player development reputations in the NBA. Gordon Hayward widely credited him for developing him into an all star, he also worked closely with Damian Lillard and Paul Millsap and is currently working with Donovan Mitchell. Lillard also speaks incredibly highly of Bryant. Bryant works closely with players and crafts individual personalized development paths to make sure they succeed and gets on the court with every player on the roster. He would also be coming from the Quinn Snyder coaching tree which is a huge plus since Snyder is regarded as one of the best coaches in the game. Bryant is an intriguing prospect because for a lot of our young guys he could be the best case scenario in terms of pure development, that said his youth could indicate that when it comes to the X's and O's he may not be ready to be a head coach yet. That said he's known for watching a ton of film and breaking down games in detail so you never know if he could end up being a future COTY candidate. 


**David Adelman**- Adelman is a current assistant coach for the Denver Nuggets and son of coaching legend Rick Adelman. Again, I think getting a coach who has experience with big men is a big plus for this team. Adelman obviously works with Jokic, but also was an assistant for Minnesota for 3 years working with Towns. Another thing I like about Adelman was that prior to being an assistant coach, he worked in player development which is obviously the foremost priority for the Bulls. That said, I couldn't find anything on Adelman in terms of coaching philosophy, but his experience and hiring by one of the most competent front offices in the league makes him a candidate that deserves a look. 


**David Vanterpool**- Vanterpool is currently an assistant for the Portland Trail Blazers. Vanterpool is already receiving a lot of buzz about his potential as a head coach and interviewed in the offseason for multiple open head coaching positions. Both Lillard and McCollum speak highly of him in terms of their development on both ends of the floor, something that I think bodes well for Dunn and Lavine in terms of development. Again in terms of coaching philosophy it was very difficult to find stuff, but my general sense was that he's a very hands on coach, which bodes well for player development. Apparently he also works with Boylen on the Canadian National Team staff, I firmly believe we would be getting the better half of that duo.


**Nate Tibbetts**- Tibbetts is another Blazers assistant coach and has been with the team for 5 years and has head coaching experience in the g-league prior to that (where he was very successful). Tibbetts also interviewed for multiple head coaching gigs this offseason and is widely considered to be an inevitable head coach in the league. Again in terms of philosophy it was hard to find anything on Tibbetts except again he has a stellar reputation. I should add that for both Vanterpool and Tibbetts, Terry Stotts (the current head coach of the Blazers), has been regarded as one of the best coaches in the league and blazers have had a lot of success over the past few years despite last year's playoffs collapse. If the belief that behind a good head coach are good assistant coaches, getting one of Tibbetts or Vanterpool could be fantastic.

"Going into this years draft, there doesn't seem there are too many options especially for a team like the Bulls where we just drafted a PF and C. We have a SG we just paid and a PG that is probably our best defensive player but is due to get paid shortly. Any 3 of the Duke players are an option but we would probably have to end up in the top 3 or maybe Phoenix is ahead of us and choose Ja Morant instead one of the Duke players. But outside maybe those 4 players, the rest of the players are kind of in the same tier (the projected lottery players).  So I was thinking what if we weren't able to get one of those Duke players?

"So the first season was good. He did hit the rookie wall but overall the season was good and I think we all had high expectations for this season. We heard things about him workin out in the summer and man did that turn out well! Boy got bigger and stronger, I was hyped Neil Funk! Then he got injured right away. The Bulls did not play well and we had some other injuries so the hopes of playoffs was off the table. That's all right, it's still all about development at this point and we don't necessarily need the playoffs yet. Lauri was out for weeks but I was still very confident that this will be a great season for him. Then he got back and BOOM, they fired Hoiberg. OK, maybe this new guy has a better plan and Lauri will get more touches. I can't say I was ecstatic about Fred all the time but man do I miss him now... Change to Boylen has been horrible. Everything sucks even harder and I'm now super worried about the development of Lauri (as well as our other young talent) Lauri has a high ceiling, a lot higher that a lot of people first gave him credit for. He's a hard worker and a smart young man so he has the tools to get there. However these couple of seasons are critical for his development and if (when) he has to play these critical years under such atrocious coaching  I'm very concerned.

"This was supposed to be a development year for our young players. What the fuck is going on?

We had a coach who's clearly shown he knows how to help young guys unlock their true potential (see Dunn, Lavine transformation. Hell, even fucking Archi looked pretty good under him). Hoiberg's entire coaching plan was meant to incorporate exactly the players we have on our roster (fast-paced, lots of 3s, spacing and ball movement). He had no qualms about tanking and his rotations weren't too bad. He looked like he was really helping Wendell get to where he needed to go both defensively and offensively. 

And then he was fired out of nowhere apparently for ""losing the locker room"" and replaced with this sack of shit we have right now. 

Since then, our locker room situation got significantly worse to the point where our players thought it was okay to question even going to practice. Our rotations are fucked and our bench lineup looks like dogshit. Almost every single guy ok n the team aside from Dunn seems to have regressed. Our guys don't even seem to understand when they're supposed to pass or shoot anymore, it's just organized chaos. Wendell had his minutes and offense both slashed and gets benched for Lopez. Lauri is taking like 6 shots a game. Hutchinson looks lost. WHAT IN THE FUCK IS GOING ON? 

Boylen is legitimately a moron who has no idea what he's doing and this year is quickly turning into a wasted, zero development year. 

Guys, watching the team like this is making me miserable. I never thought I would say this, but I would kill to have Hoiberg and his Hoiball back.

GarPax for the love of all that is good and holy, why? WHY?

/endrant, sorry I just needed to vent guys, this shit sucks

EDIT: Oh my God we're getting 2 years of this guy? They're fucking with us right? That's the only explanation I can think of.

"With the Anthony Davis auction going on, I've been trying to talk myself into the possibility of the Bulls trading for him before the next free agency period. Davis has said before that he just wants to win. He also has said that wants to be known as the greatest player ever from Chicago so we know he has love for his hometown.

&#x200B;

The first two teams you hear about in the race are the Celtics and the Lakers because of all the pieces they have. Unless they trade Kyrie (Rose Rule), the Celtics have to wait until after the moratorium period for a deal to happen. Even then, the Celtics would probably need to trade Jayson Tatum and I don't really see Ainge doing that (although he might). The trade I see that gets brought up most often for the Lakers includes Lonzo and Ingram. I know we can't match elite level trade packages but I'm sure we can offer something more appealing than Lonzo and BI. Between all of the young talent we have, as well as our high draft position this year, the Bulls could get into the mix if they wanted to. With AD in Chicago, the Bulls would become an immediate free agent destination to sign another high profile FA who's looking to compete in the weaker Eastern Conference. If the Bulls become a threat in the east and Davis has some help, I don't see why he wouldn't want to resign.

&#x200B;

Like I said, I've been trying to talk myself into this idea. I'm not a whiz when it comes to the trade machine or the more in depth salary rules. Maybe somebody with more knowledge can tell me why the Bulls either can't, or wouldn't want to trade for AD (outside of the usual GarPax hate).","Anthony Davis Trade With the Anthony Davis auction going on, I've been trying to talk myself into the possibility of the Bulls trading for him before the next free agency period.

"I'm riding the increased hype around Culver big time. He's got guard skills and realistically could enter the league as a 6'7 Gary Harris with the potential to be even better than that. Behind him, I've got Barrett, whose abilities I'm still not totally sold on and whose likelihood to improve notably I'm even less sold on. Rounding out the top 3 is DeAndre Hunter, who I would love to see in a Bulls uniform. Super smart guy, staunch defender (though his numbers on that end have suffered a little this year as he's absorbed a bigger offensive role) and while old for a Soph, he's still very much young enough to be a part of our long-term future.

Theory starts at about 42 minutes, but for those of you that aren't into podcasts or not in a place where you can listen here is what I got: ((THIS IS JUST A FUN THEORY, NO I DON'T THINK THIS IS TRUE AND IT MAY NOT EVEN BE THE BEST PATH))

\-Garpax said they were going to retool/build WITH Butler, they did just that in 2016-2017, in a desperate win now move, they failed in signing dinosaurs who couldn't shoot.

\-Their next move was to build with Jimmy by exchanging him for what looked like a complete shutdown/rebuild. Lets be fair, Jimmy/Niko/Dinwiddie/Moore group people keep retrospectively clawing for cracks the top 4 in the east at it's peak. Jimmy agreed and sacrificed this to set himself up better here in the future.

\-We pull out a young athletic shot creator, a defensive dog, and a unicorn (Bulls played their best O/D RAT differential when Jimmy shared the floowr with Doug and/or Niko). Jimmy complained that he had to do everything offensively and wanted other guys who can share that spotlight. Giving Zach/Lauri/Dunn a few years on their own to grow and to be tried on what they can do when they are the guys. (I think Zach was the real one to be tested, Lauri was a surprise).

\-Jimmy's trainer who said Gar was worse than a drug dealer has deleted his post and worked a lot with Bobbby/Denzel.

\-The trade itself broke up one of the more promising young cores in the whole league in Minny. Jimmy went on and exposed them for their weaknesses and dipped out. He is now in Philly and is rumored to be stirring up the pot there (The East's best core of the future). If he f\*\*\*s the process just a little bit, and dips, the lost pieces in Saric and Covington helps inhibit their rise to dominance.

\-Jimmy has still been doing some dealing in real estate in Chicago

\-Jimmy comes home, the team has the best defense (with Wendell/Jimmy/Dunn anchoring) in the league and improves on offense, gets a 6th man or a competing starter in the top 5 of the draft, resigns Bobby and acquires a few vets for the bench, mission complete, we are cooking with gas.","Podcast: Jimmy Butler: GARPAX SLEEPER AGENT | The Bully Pulpit | 1.6.19 (Jimmy Conspiracy Theory in post) [https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/jimmy-butler-garpax-sleeper-agent-the-bully-pulpit-1-6-19/id1442109982?i=1000427173030&mt=2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/jimmy-butler-garpax-sleeper-agent-the-bully-pulpit-1-6-19/id1442109982?i=1000427173030&mt=2)

### 5. The Bulls have built a time machine and are using it for evil

As  Jim Boylen often says, he worked for Gregg Popovich and Rudy  Tomjanovich. You don't get to those places without knowing the game, and  how to coach it.

I just don't really get what he is trying to prove turning the Bulls into a slow-it-down post-up machine.

The  Bulls under Boylen are averaging almost 14.5 post-ups per 100  possessions -- up from nine under Fred Hoiberg, per Second Spectrum.  That increase is proportionally even larger, since Boylen has the Bulls  crawling.

Boylen argues playing inside-out allows Chicago to  control pace, limit turnovers, and force opponents to play against its  set defense. That sounds like a thing. Chicago just doesn't have the  personnel to, like, do it. Popovich and Tomjanovich had Tim Duncan, [David Robinson](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/715/david-robinson) and [Hakeem Olajuwon](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/619/hakeem-olajuwon). The 2018-19 Bulls have ... other players.

Since Boylen took over, only Joel Embiid, [Karl-Anthony Towns](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136195/karl-anthony-towns) and [LaMarcus Aldridge](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2983/lamarcus-aldridge) have posted up more often per possession than [Robin Lopez](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3447/robin-lopez),  according to Second Spectrum. I love Robin Lopez. He revels in the  dirty work that wins. His hardwood-scraping, floor-to-ceiling  ice-cream-scoop hook is a little piece of hoops art.

There is just no universe in which Lopez should be posting up this much.

Chicago has been the league's *least* efficient post-up team under  Boylen. They are taking more midrange jumpers. They are last in free  throw rate, and 29th in turnover rate. (Prioritizing ball security and  somehow almost leading the league in turnover rate almost makes me think  the Bulls are embarking on some Joaquin Phoenix-style meta public art  spectacle.) They have the NBA's worst offense in that span by a margin  so wide it looks like a glitch. The best way to force opponents into  playing against your set defense is to score! 

There is [really no evidence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2015/08/03/missed-three-pointers-dont-always-lead-to-nba-fast-breaks/?noredirect=on)  that shooting 3s -- and especially non-corner 3s -- leads to any  increase in opponent transition points. Plenty of teams manage to quash  fast breaks and limit turnovers while playing modern-style offenses.

Boylen  doesn't think the Bulls are ready to do both. There is value in  establishing effort and defense as baseline thresholds for playing time.  But you can prioritize those things while still building the kind of  offense [Kris Dunn](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2991139/kris-dunn), [Zach LaVine](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064440/zach-lavine), Markkanen and Carter will need to play -- and *want* to play -- when it comes time to contend for the playoffs.

"Suns receive: Jabari Parker

Bulls receive: Ryan Anderson, 2019 Milwaukee 1st (protected 1-3, 17-30, ie will not convey this year), 2019 Phoenix 2nd

But hold on, it's got more depth than it initially appears:

1. Ryan Anderson makes 5M less per year than Jabari, so keeping up still allows us to pursue some mid-tier RFAs this summer now that Holiday's money is off the books for the most part. If Selden is legit, we could use part of that to pay him, then spend the rest on a wing. Also consider that next year, he is an expiring contract and could be traded AGAIN for further value if a team really needs it. 

2. The Milwaukee pick actually will not convert until next season because of protections, so we'd be getting a pick around ~25 for the 2020 draft, which is supposed to be pretty bad overall but a pick is a pick. We also can consider the fact that Milwaukee faces a pretty rough free agency this summer where they have to choose whether to overpay Khris Middleton or seek other options. If they fail, then we could see this pick be closer to 20-25, which is good value.

3. The Phoenix 2nd is almost certainly going to be around 30-35 this summer. Now that we have Memphis' 2nd as well (probably around 35-40), there is a chance we could use them to move up for a late pick in this year's first round, where there are a ton of high risk high reward gambles that we could roll the dice on. Guys like Daniel Gafford, Iggy Pazdeikis (love this guy), and Grant Williams (this guy too) will be available in that area.

The Suns want to do this (again, this was proposed by a Suns fan) because they are desperate for cap space in a stacked free agency class and could do it without giving up their highly vaunted 2019 1st. They and could get some real help (maybe just re-signing Oubre) that would help Booker/Ayton/2019 pick make the playoffs. We want to do this because we get a handful of decent assets for a player we (for some reason) refuse to play.

"Trade grades: Who wins the Bulls-Grizzlies deal?
Kevin Pelton
ESPN Staff Writer 
http://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/25679044/justin-holiday-trade-grades-do-bulls-grizzlies-win-deal

The deal

Grizzlies get: Forward Justin Holiday

Bulls get: Forward Wayne Selden, guard MarShon Brooks and Memphis' 2019 and 2020 second-round picks

---------------------
Memphis Grizzlies: B

Having unsuccessfully attempted to deal Brooks and Selden plus second-round picks to acquire Kelly Oubre as part of last month's failed three-team trade with the Phoenix Suns and Washington Wizards, the Grizzlies re-baited the hook to land Holiday in a deal expected to in fact be completed.

While Holiday doesn't at age 29 have the long-term potential of Oubre, his 3-and-D skill set is more helpful in the here and now. Remarkably, because of the low replacement level on the wing and the long minutes Holiday was logging in Chicago (34.9 per game, putting him 14th in the league), he ranks just outside the NBA's top 30 in wins above replacement player by my metric this season (3.7 WARP).

That will be useful for a Memphis team that has lost eight of its past 10 games to slip from sixth in the Western Conference three weeks ago to a tie for 10th entering play Thursday. Even after the summer additions of starters Kyle Anderson and Garrett Temple, wing was the obvious spot for the Grizzlies to upgrade. Their backups at shooting guard and small forward, including Brooks and Selden, have struggled.

Brooks had a .487 true shooting percentage in the month of November, dragging down his overall efficiency to unacceptable levels for a score-first player. Meanwhile, Selden's 32 percent 3-point shooting and his penchant for overexuberant mistakes made it hard for coach J.B. Bickerstaff to trust him on the court. The other, more valuable Brooks (Dillon) has been hit or miss since returning from injury, scoring 33 points on 11-of-21 shooting in his two best games but totaling 7 points on 3-of-15 in the two others.

Holiday is versatile enough to play alongside any of Memphis' other wings, allowing him to start or come off the bench depending on how Bickerstaff's rotation shakes out. Holiday has established himself as a league-average 3-point shooter (he's been between 35 and 36 percent each of the past three seasons) on increasing volume. So far this season, Holiday is one of 14 players in the league averaging at least seven 3-point attempts per game, which will help a team that ranks 28th in the league in made 3s on a per-game basis.

Defense was Holiday's calling card before he developed as a shooter in his mid-20s, and his length and diligence at that end of the court will fit right in with the Grit 'n' Grind 2.0 Grizzlies. At a listed 6-foot-6 and 181 pounds, Holiday isn't quite big enough to deal with the Kevin Durants of the world, meaning Anderson will still have to handle those assignments, but Bickerstaff will no longer have any defensive liabilities in his wing rotation.

Though Holiday is making a modest $4.4 million this season, dealing two players on minimum-salary contracts for him still pushes Memphis within $500,000 of the luxury-tax line, according to ESPN's Bobby Marks. That will prevent the Grizzlies from filling their open roster spot with a player on a guaranteed contract for the time being. That spot could, however, be useful come buyout season.

The cost to Memphis here is a pair of second-round picks, both of which have a chance to end up in the top half of the round and be reasonably valuable. I'd have felt better about dealing those picks for someone like Oubre with the potential to help the Grizzlies long term, but as Marks noted on Twitter, Holiday's early Bird rights could help Memphis re-sign him as an unrestricted free agent this summer.

---------------------
Chicago Bulls: B

From the Bulls' standpoint, this deal was somewhat more straightforward. Holiday's skill set held relatively little value to a non-contender, and in the final year of his deal he was all but certain to get moved by the deadline. The question was mostly who could offer the best second-round picks in return. There's certainly upside in getting Memphis' picks. If something happens with Mike Conley or Marc Gasol, we've seen the Grizzlies slide in the standings before.

The one complication from Chicago's perspective was trading one player for two with a full roster, which means the Bulls had to waive backup guard Cameron Payne. That closes the book on a disappointing Chicago tenure for Payne, the centerpiece of the Bulls' 2017 deadline deal sending Taj Gibson to the Oklahoma City Thunder. After missing much of that season due to a broken bone in his foot, Payne has never been able to make good on the promise he showed at Murray State. Since Payne was in the final year of his rookie contract, waiving him has no long-term cap ramifications for Chicago.","Kevin Pelton of ESPN's Grades for the Bulls / Grizzlies Trade Trade grades: Who wins the Bulls-Grizzlies deal?

Holiday has established himself as a league-average 3-point shooter (he's been between 35 and 36 percent each of the past three seasons) on increasing volume. So far this season, Holiday is one of 14 players in the league averaging at least seven 3-point attempts per game, which will help a team that ranks 28th in the league in made 3s on a per-game basis.

Defense was Holiday's calling card before he developed as a shooter in his mid-20s, and his length and diligence at that end of the court will fit right in with the Grit 'n' Grind 2.0 Grizzlies. At a listed 6-foot-6 and 181 pounds, Holiday isn't quite big enough to deal with the Kevin Durants of the world, meaning Anderson will still have to handle those assignments, but Bickerstaff will no longer have any defensive liabilities in his wing rotation.

Though Holiday is making a modest $4.4 million this season, dealing two players on minimum-salary contracts for him still pushes Memphis within $500,000 of the luxury-tax line, according to ESPN's Bobby Marks. That will prevent the Grizzlies from filling their open roster spot with a player on a guaranteed contract for the time being. That spot could, however, be useful come buyout season.

The cost to Memphis here is a pair of second-round picks, both of which have a chance to end up in the top half of the round and be reasonably valuable. I'd have felt better about dealing those picks for someone like Oubre with the potential to help the Grizzlies long term, but as Marks noted on Twitter, Holiday's early Bird rights could help Memphis re-sign him as an unrestricted free agent this summer.

---------------------
Chicago Bulls: B

From the Bulls' standpoint, this deal was somewhat more straightforward. Holiday's skill set held relatively little value to a non-contender, and in the final year of his deal he was all but certain to get moved by the deadline. The question was mostly who could offer the best second-round picks in return. There's certainly upside in getting Memphis' picks. If something happens with Mike Conley or Marc Gasol, we've seen the Grizzlies slide in the standings before.

The one complication from Chicago's perspective was trading one player for two with a full roster, which means the Bulls had to waive backup guard Cameron Payne. That closes the book on a disappointing Chicago tenure for Payne, the centerpiece of the Bulls' 2017 deadline deal sending Taj Gibson to the Oklahoma City Thunder. After missing much of that season due to a broken bone in his foot, Payne has never been able to make good on the promise he showed at Murray State. Since Payne was in the final year of his rookie contract, waiving him has no long-term cap ramifications for Chicago.",6,24,Kevin Pelton of ESPN's Grades for the Bulls / Grizzlies Trade,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/acje01/kevin_pelton_of_espns_grades_for_the_bulls/

"Hey all, been a huge bulls fan since I moved here 21 years ago. I've been able to go to several games with just another person, but taking the whole family, my wife and 2 little kids, can get pretty expensive. Any thoughts on what's the best place to get Tix? I've always gone with season ticket holders that I knew but they only have 2 seats, I need 4. I've heard good and bad things about StubHub, so looking for advice here.

"I know our last matchup wasn't exactly the most friendly (lol) but I freakin love the Bulls young core and you guys are going to be championship contenders sooner than people think. Anyway, here's the trade: https://imgur.com/a/Uz6TPNz

Both teams do this for a couple of reasons:

Thunder: The thunder get a bench scorer in Bobby Portis that takes the scoring load off of Schroder in the second unit. Also, we finally get another good shooter in Justin holiday who can also defend too. Felicio is backup center insurance for Adams and Noel as well.

Bulls: They get rid of Felicio's disgusting contract while also getting a few expiring contracts back in Abrines and TLC. Patterson is a good veteran presence for the Bulls who are a pretty young team that still needs to learn how to win, and his becomes an expiring after this year so it would be easy to get rid of if they wanted. Losing Bobby and Justin might be a little tough but getting a first and a second is good compensation, plus this frees up minutes for Lauri at PF so he can develop more into his star potential. 

Here's a link to the trade: http://tradenba.com/trades/H15AonmZN

"In case you hadn't been keeping up, Warriors G/F Pat McCaw held out against his former team because he felt disrespected by their extension offer. Today, he signed an offer sheet with Cleveland for two years, $6M. The Warriors have a chance to match, as he was an RFA, but it is unclear if they will do so.

$3M is absolutely nothing, that's just under 300k more than the league vet minimum. McCaw wasn't exactly a showstopper but he's an 6'7"" NBA caliber wing that can slot in 1-3 and provide some length, size, and occasional shooting. He's just a bench guy, but he showed up in the playoffs as a key rotation player for GSW their 2017 title run and he's only 23. 

Instead, we have Jabari on a gigantic contract (despite tanking his trade value by not playing him), Payne somehow still on this roster despite being displaced by not one but two former G Leaguers this season, AND an potential emergency roster spot because of Valentine's season-ending surgery on his ankles that as far as I'm aware the Bulls haven't even applied for.

GarPax talks a lot of game about cap flexibility to take chances on young talent, but the Jabari signing and Payne extension kept us out of the sweepstakes for the Faried+1st salary dump from Denver that Brooklyn got, and kept us from taking a flier on a decent young player at a serious position of need.

The trade deadline is still two months away, and the December 15th date where recently signed players can be traded has passed. What are we waiting for? Why are we allowing other tanking teams to consistently do more with less? /rant","Anyone else kind of pissed that we didn't extend an offer sheet to Pat McCaw?

"With Payne sidelided, Blakeney came back to rotation.

Many of us have been frustrated with his ""I'll shoot no matter what"" mindset. But let's take this time to imagine how worse the situation could be and choose his pair.

Here is my top 3:

1. Jerian Grant: those who watched the Bulls last seasons remember how he would dribble for 20s and then take a step back jumper. Cool huh?
2. Jordan Clarkson: do I need to say anything else?

"EVERYONE was watching EVERY game!  Christmas was a big deal due to the games and of course the Bull merchandise we all got and gave.  We had a team we totally believed in.  A team and coach that had told everyone, the NBA, Reinsdorf, Jerry Krause.... F YOU! We are going to burn anything down that is in our way.  Nobody could touch us.  We didn't have the bad reputation that keeps free agents from darkening our floors.  Players wanted to play here. 

&#x200B;

No we are forced to accept tanking in hopes that it won't take us a dozen years to put together a decent team.  We are mocked by the likes of the Sacramento Kings and the pundits on ESPN and NBA TV who constantly tell us we have the worst front office in the NBA.  We've got a once proud franchise the Jordan, Pippen, Jackson etc... worked to get to the team with the third most amount of championships.... And there we stood proudly next to the Celtics and Lakers as one of the upper echelon basketball teams of all time...

But, then they broke the team up so Krause could prove he could build another champion.  A series of humiliations and failures followed.  Every time we lucked into something Krause, Paxson and the rest of the stooges pissed on it immediately. 

Now here we are... Cheering for Rose to beat our asses.... I'm glad he did.  The Chicago Fans were on Rose's side tonight.   Noah will be here soon and we will all probably embrace and be on his side as well.  Veteran talents that could have been with us forever.... but they were squandered away by Paxson's stupidity..... 

&#x200B;

We suck now and it is not going to get better before it gets worse. Sure we have a few bright spots.  But nobody really has their hearts in this team.  It's sad....

&#x200B;

And by the way, since the Bulls broke up that Championship team in 1998,  The San Antonio Spurs have won five.  One more to beat us, two more to knock us down to fourth.  A very sad time for a once proud franchise and fans whose only fault seems to be deep loyalty without any demand for results.

"Obviously having Lauri and Dunn back gives us something to look forward to. But one of the most painful things to watch as a Bulls fan all season has been their soft performance against bad teams. Nice to see them string together a couple wins in that regard.
  
 
With the defense looking better, maybe we have a fighting chance when the offense isn't clicking against good teams, and hopefully a better chance in close games in the final 2 min (another huge weakness we've shown all season).

"In the likely event that the bulls get something top 3 (maybe even #1), I don't think that any of the current top prospects are the right fit for the Bulls and are overvalued by the market. 

&#x200B;

Zion is an enigma of a prospect. He has great upside risk but also probably the largest downside risk of most recent #1s. His athleticism and power is what sets him apart from the rest, at #1 right now, but I see those things as having massive risk attached to them. We are looking at a player heavier than Ben Wallace, playing a game style that is significantly more taxing on the body. I look at how so many of the guards recently have been having recurring injuries due to their bodies breaking down. I see the same risk in Zion's playing style but it being exacerbated due to his weight and size. 

&#x200B;

R.J. has too many flaws for me, similar to Reddish. We have one of the best young Cs in the league, in WCJ, so I wouldn't look at someone like Bol Bol either. 

&#x200B;

It feels like the league is so incredibly high on the top end of this class, that we could take advantage and trade down to get the two best fitting players for us going forward: Doumbouya and Culver. After watching a few Texas Tech games, Culver is looking fantastic and could be a great long term upgrade on LaVine (who has been amazing on offensive but a complete liability on defence). Doumbouya looks like he could be the second coming of Giannis, though more developed at the time of joining the league and already working on his 3. 

&#x200B;

I would love to see a Dunn, Culver, Doumbouya, Markkanen, WCJ starting lineup in 1-2 years. 

&#x200B;

Am I crazy? Would we even be able to pick up 2 draft picks (7 & 10 according to tankathon at the moment) if we traded down with something like the #1?","Even with a high pick, I want us to trade down In the likely event that the bulls get something top 3 (maybe even #1), I don't think that any of the current top prospects are the right fit for the Bulls and are overvalued by the market.

"We all know that changes take time. We're going from pace and space to... I don't even know how can I call it.

I've been watching the Bulls games

So here are some of the Pop things that I really wanted to see on this Bulls:

&#x200B;

**1. Use and abuse of mismatchs**

I don't think it's just a Pop thing, but Pop really uses it a lot and that it the last thing the Bulls has been doing. For example, to my mind yesterday's game was supposed to be played through the bigs and yet that was the last thing it happened.

Do you know how many shots Markkanen had? Just 6 the entire game and just 1on the second half. Just for you to know, Markkanen had as many shot as Arcy and Payne. Can you believe that?

Carter just shot 10 times, RoLo 3.

Did you see any post-up by RoLo? I didn't either.

&#x200B;

**2. Getting your best players involved, playing through them**

I don't have to say much, do I?

&#x200B;

**3. Take the best of the time clock**

Some of the beauty of Pop's plays is that they try to get the best of every possession. If you watched a couple of Spurs' games, you saw a lot of cutters, passing a good shot for a great shot, ball movement, etc.

One thing the Bulls are doing is to waste half or more than that to start the offense and I'm pretty sure that's not the Spurs' way of running the show.

&#x200B;

Those are some of the applicable things.

And that said, I don't think I'm watching any Bulls games anymore, maybe I'll change my mind after the all-star break. Since Boylen has taken over, it's been unwatchable, it feels a wasting of time. If you really love basketball, maybe you should do the same and maybe go watch some of Doncic or some fun teams such as Toronto, Warriors et all.","Since Boylen loves talking about Pop, what are the Pop things you want to see on this Bulls?

**Reason Bulls Would Make This Trade:** At this point in the re-build, I think we should be in the asset and prospect accumulation mode.  Markelle Fultz's value could not be lower right now, so we should try to rehabilitate his game for a year or two before flipping him for more value.  Don't think he can be everything he was hoped to be when he was drafted, but I definitely see him developing into the next Shaun Livingston (good size, no three point shot, above average back-up PG).  Zhaire Smith has had injury problems this year, but is only 19 and projects as a fantastic SG that can take over for LaVine after this contract.  Draft Profile here: [https://stats.nba.com/articles/2018-nba-draft-profile-zhaire-smith/](https://stats.nba.com/articles/2018-nba-draft-profile-zhaire-smith/).  As a guy who can be a defensive difference maker and is a freak athlete, I think he's a worthy gamble.  Wilson Chandler is salary filler that we likely wouldn't resign.

&#x200B;

**Reasons Sixers Would Make This Trade:** Sixers need to make a strong run in the playoffs this year to convince Jimmy to stay.  This trade would upgrade the 5th starter position and improve their center options behind Embiid.  Justin Holiday is a better defender than Wilson Chandler ([http://bkref.com/tiny/j7Y8P](http://bkref.com/tiny/j7Y8P)) a more willing three point shooter and, while they are shooting a similar percentage from 3 right now, Holiday has been a better 3 point shooter across his career.  Holiday brings less playmaking than Wilson Chandler, but considering the rest of the Sixers starting line-up, I suspect they will prefer to upgrade Chandler for a better 3 point shooter who plays better defense.  Robin Lopez would bring defense and rebounding to a Sixers bench that desperately needs more options at center.  Amir Johnson and Mike Muscala definitely aren't the answer for when Emibiid sits, and they're been a lot worse without him on the floor ([https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/embiijo01/on-off/2019](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/embiijo01/on-off/2019)).  Lopez would limit the drop off when Embiid sits, would allow Embiid to play fewer minutes per game and Lopez could credibly start at center if/when Embiid gets injured.  Cam Payne is salary filler.

"I tried to fight the urge to call this team a possible playoff team this summer. We have a ton of super young, super unproven talent on this team and several of them are extremely injury prone. That is not a recipe for making the playoffs. This doesn't aim to be a, ""told you so thread"" but rather a thread about how to enjoy watching the Bulls again.

This sub is so god damn negative it's not even fun to visit anymore, and that negativity comes directly from improper preseason expectations. This sub talked themselves into a mid to high 40s win team and when reality hits that it's a high teens, low 20s win team, everyone is calling for peoples heads: Gar, Pax, Hoiberg, Boylen, etc. The reality is that rebuilding in the NBA takes YEARS and young teams just aren't that good. This core is still 5-8 years away from their prime. We're not meant to win now. 

If instead, you expect the team to go out and give effort, to see semi-regular good games from our young budding NBA players, and to spend a little extra time looking at the top draft prospects and finding another fun team to watch (I recommend the Nuggets, Clippers and Bucks) to bide your time, you wouldn't be furious every day. I mean jesus, everyone is pissed that a team without Zach LaVine went into the 3rd best team in the West, who are furious because we beat them somehow last time, and got killed. Literally every single person who is not a Bulls fan saw this coming.

"Seems like our teams just been on the craziest roller coaster after that D Rose buzzer beater against the Cavs in that series in 2015. I know it wasn‚Äôt smooth sailing before that but that just feels like the most recent great Bulls moment (not including The 3 Alphas taking Boston to task before one of them fell üòÇ).

I feel like if we beat Lebron that series, for better or worse, Thibs wouldn‚Äôt have been fired and well who knows what kind position we‚Äôd be in now. I know they said Thibs and the FO had a terrible relationship at that point, but could even our FO fire a coach that took you to the Finals? (Let‚Äôs be honest, the Hawks would not have beaten us in the ECF, especially if we just beat the Cavs. But I doubt anyone was going to stop the Warriors even in their first championship season this era. Who knows.)

So that got me thinking. Let‚Äôs say for hypothetical reasons, it‚Äôs the summer of 2015. The Cavs just beat us. If you were the GM, what would you do then? Keep Thibs or fire him? Would you try to sign any other players? And then how do you see the team shaping up until this point now, Dec. 2018.","What would you do if you were given the chance to be the Bulls GM?

Why am I more excited for DRose in Minny than the Bulls this year? Shit, I'm more excited for Brooke Lopez than Robin Lopez. I'm more excited for Jrue Holliday than Justin. I'm more excited for Phoenix than the Bulls. I'd literally take a random fan off the street over GarPax right now.  The Bulls will make money no matter who's in charge. What have these clowns done well? What have they done at all? Thibs did it all. Check the stats. You defend GarPax, you don't accept reality. Wins and losses. Without Thibs, this franchise is a complete joke since 98. ",36,20,Bulls Front Office Is Trying To Blame The Players.

"Please read this article if you haven't gotten the chance. Here's my favorite excerpt:

&#x200B;

>In the second meeting on Sunday, the idea of forming a leadership committee was discussed, multiple sources told ESPN. The idea is that in the future, those appointed to the committee would be able to act as a liaison between the players and coaches.

&#x200B;

GarPax are literally creating a ""committee"" like some sort of dysfunctional government or university administration to delegate away THEIR responsibilities. They fire Hoiberg so Boylen can take over the team with all their players returning (who knows of GarPax's view on Boylen's longevity, not like they'd ever actually conduct an interview process). Then, Boylen, showing the influence of his tenure as an assistant to Popps, benches the starters during one of the most embarrassing games in the team's history. The starters (assumingely led by Zach LaVine), proceed to cry about it, and this is GarPax's response.

&#x200B;

Who knows what the long-term future of the Chicago Bulls holds. But GarPax time and time again fail to create any sense of cohesiveness throughout the entire organization, and at this point it's getting embarrassing. LaVine is a solid offensive player who's currently overpaid and serves best in a secondary-scorer role; Markkanen has potential to be an All-Star if he continues to develop and stay healthy; WCJ looks like he'll serve as a defensive anchor with a well-rounded offensive game; and Portis is a solid 6th man who provides competitive energy off the bench. Aside from that, Jabari Parker is grossly overpaid (fortunately his contract has a team option next year) for being such a horrible defender; Kris Dunn is at-best a bench player who can provide a solid 20 minutes a night defending and running the second team's offense; and that's about it. Keep in mind, this is the team GarPax leaves us with in 2018 after the 2010-11 Chicago Bulls won the Eastern Conference. This is entirely their fault.

&#x200B;

Why in the world would a star FA want to sign with Chicago? I know I wouldn't. While GarPax hold the reigns of this organization, the NBA Draft will be the most entertaining part of Chicago's season.

"By now it would clear that this will go down to be another tanking year, whether they'll try or not. As most would know, 2019 draft is loaded with wing talent in the top 10. With Bulls dire need to fill in the SF position, it's a no brainer that they are expected to draft a wing talent to play SF.


Given the starting five with Dunn, LaVine, 2019 rookie, Lauri and WCJ, Bulls would have a filled the starting five for the next five years. But still it doesn't make them a playoff contender. Though talented, these are still rookies in their early 20's. Just refer to the Timberwolves before acquiring Jimmy Butler. 


#2020 is the new 2010
2020 would be Lauri's last year in rookie contract. The last time Bulls would be enjoying they're ""cap space."" After 2020, Lauri's extension would kick in and it will likely a max.




#2020 Free Agents(Either they land AD or AD)


1. Anthony Davis. This is redundant, but still AD is going to be their target, whether I mention him or not. But doesn't mean he is going here.

2. Andre Drummond. Yeah right Bulls have a more nimble defensive stopper in WCJ. But Drummond's presence inside is the perfect compliment to Lauri. And not to mention Drummond's age coincide with Bulls core players, all hitting their prime under Bulls contract. So what will happen to WCJ? Moved to the bench and play the sixth man role. WCJ can play PF/C IMO and would have a deadly front court rotation along with Lauri and Anthony Davis or Andre Drummond

3. Draymond Green. At 30 Y.O I believe he would still be productive, because he doesn't have to rely in his athleticism to be effective on the court. He will still be an important piece in a championship team. He also gives the Bulls full flexibility to go big or small playing with Lauri.


Without Felicio, Bobby and Denzel, Bulls would have around $60M to spend in 2020. If they couldn't land AD, maybe they can land both Draymond and the other AD(Andre Drummond). Just note that these three address Bulls glaring weakness in rebounding department.","Is anyone looking at 2020 free agency the way I do?

"We got torched by a Celtics team that everyone considered the best team in the conference pre-season. Not only did we get torched by them, we got torched by their role players with Smart, Theis and Brown raining 3s on us in the first half. Theis is shooting 35% from 3 while the other 2 are both below 30%. That's some back luck. Combine that with the Celtics being a top 2 defense in the NBA and you're not going to have a good time.

How about we keep a few things in mind before we start a major fucking panic over Jim Boylen after a week:

1) The Pacers game was the best defensive effort we've given in years.

2) The OKC win was the biggest of the season, if not the biggest in a few years given our recent struggles.

3) The players just had their biggest workload they've had since becoming a Bull. Extra running, longer practices and many suicides. They are on the 2nd night of a back to back. Imagine LaVine is our there down 37 in the late 3rd and 4th quarter and he tears his ACL again. This place would be fucking littered with posts about how naive Jim is for leaving LaVine in there to get hurt down 37. Or a Lauri elbow re-injury. 

4) The Bulls young core, playing against the Celtics deep bench is not some fantastic learning opportunity. What is, is sending a message. The Bulls came out flat both halves and Jim sent a message. The question is will he lose the team over trying to send this message, or will it galvanize the team? No one here knows. 

Take a breath, relax, and let's see how the team responds over the next TWENTY games, not individual games. And lets see if and how the team progresses over those games.","Can everyone take a deep breath? We got torched by a Celtics team that everyone considered the best team in the conference pre-season.

"So I think boylen just needs to step this whole toughness and anti-fred thing a bit down.
We saw in the game against okc how good this group can be and what they can do when playing tough and hard, but I also believe that all these long and tough practices were getting them exhausted because they're just not used to it. You're basically going from 0 to 100 and maybe you can do it at a later point but not now because you could clearly see they looked physically and mentally destroyed against this Boston team.
Also in my opinion you can't pull this 5-man sub and not playing the starters in the 2nd half shit because even if they're not playing well you should at least give them a chance to get those experiences and maybe redeem themselves a little bit. I get that you want to send a message but it could go in the wrong direction and discourage them and that's also a way how you lose your locker room by just getting them frustrated.

So after all I still believe Boylen can be a good coach that could teach toughness but you have to give these young players time to adapt to this new system.
You could see what they can do if they're going 100 percent but for that happening on a regular basis they need a coach who doesn't get them fatigued before the games even start.

So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a barbershop with my niece, and who walks in but Lauri fucking Markkanen himself.

"It was so long since I got this emotional with a basketball game, and I mean it as my eyes were literally so bright because of joy. 

That happened after the last minute Holiday's made three. The whole reaction of the arena, the players, but most importantly Jim Boylen, moved me. It was so good to see the whole team being passionate about it, playing as they really cared about winning, caring about the team and the city of Chicago. 

I think I got emotional because it was so long since the last time I saw my favorite team playing with this kind of attitude, and seeing the coach clapping and cheering that much made me smile so much.

GarPax did the right thing, undoubtedly. I really liked Hoiberg as a guy but I was getting used to losses too, the winning culture has been slowly drifting away, month after month. 

The truth is that I don‚Äôt care about the tank, give me this over that everyday. I'm proud to be a Bulls fan.","It is beautiful to see this passion again It was so long since I got this emotional with a basketball game, and I mean it as my eyes were literally so bright because of joy.

Also, he is on one of the most team friendly deals in the league making $4.5 mil. I feel like he has real value for a playoff team. I could see a team like Houston, Memphis or Portland make a trade to try and get into the playoffs in a tough western conference. Even the the warriors could use another 3 and D wing... 

I am hoping we trade holiday while his value is high for a draft pick or young asset.

"I had some free time at work, so I ended up looking through all the stats of the Bulls players and evaluating what have been the strengths and weaknesses of each player based on both traditional and advanced stats. I figured I would write it up and share it with you all as well.

Please note that I am not a pro basketball analyst and obviously a lot of these determinations depend on subjective classifications of what is a ""strong"" or a ""weak"" figure in a given statistical category! But it was a fun exercise for me and hopefully interesting for some of you as well!

What I did was essentially this: I evaluated each statistical category and gave the player a + if they were ""good"" in that category (or ++ if they were really good). Similarly, I assigned them a - if they were ""bad"" (or -- if they were really bad). If the player has not been especially good or bad but just average in a category, there is no symbol.

Some of the determinations were based on ""absolute"" values (e.g. true shooting percentage) so if the figure was above a certain threshold, I deemed it as a +. Some of the determinations such as whether the player has a good or a bad +/-, NETRTG, or RPM were based more on relative evaluations. In other words, I compared their rating to the rest of the roster because since we have been so bad and a clearly losing team, those stats are ""bad"" or negative for most players. But if a player was clearly better or worse than most of the roster in these categories, I gave them the + or -.

I also took the role of the player into account with certain stats like rebounds or 3P% (I'm not going to give Lopez a -  in 3P% because that's not what is expected of him but I did it give it to Zach because we expect better 3-point shooting from a player in his role). Finally, **the stats are based on per 36 minutes** and not per game so that the amount of playing time won't skew the comparisons.

*The statistics are from NBA.com (except RPM and PER statistics which are from ESPN).*

*NBA stats glossary:* [*https://stats.nba.com/help/glossary/*](https://stats.nba.com/help/glossary/)

*Note: Only players with over 10 games played are included (so no Lauri, Bobby etc.)*

**Zach LaVine** (24 GP, 35.8 MIN)

|\++ Points (24.6)|\- Turnovers (3.8)|
|:-|:-|
|\+ Assists (4.9)|\- 3P% (30.8%)|

|\+ FT% (87.3%)||
|||
|\+ OFFRTG|\- DEFRTG|
|\+ ORPM|\- DRPM|
|\+ PER||
|\+ PIE||

Zach's stats paint a picture that I think corresponds pretty well with the general narrative about his performance so far (in this subreddit, I feel r/nba has been more pessimistic than they should). He has been a great scorer which translates into good offensive ratings (and good player impact ratings) when looking at those advanced metrics. At the same time, advanced metrics rate his defense as bad (which should not come as a surprise). He has a good number of assists, but also too many turnovers, so it's a wash in terms of assists to turnover ratio. The three point shooting has been much worse than his historical average also.

\-----------------------

**Justin Holiday** (25 GP, 35.4 MIN)

|\+ 3P% (39.1%)||

|\+ TS% (56.8%)||
|\+ FT% (87.5%)||
|\+ Turnovers (1.1)||
|\+ Assist / Turnover Ratio (2.36)||
|\+ Steals (1.7)||
|||
|\+ RPM (because of +ORPM)|\- NETRTG  (because of -DEFRTG)|

I could not identify a single category where Justin has been worse than average / particularly bad. So maybe this subreddit has been slightly too critical of him? His shooting has been great this season and the low number of turnovers and the second highest amount of steals in the team are also positives. The RPM is also relatively good because of his offense. However, in a bit of contradiciton, his NETRTG is relatively bad because of a relatively bad DEFRTG so that could be a sign that his defensive impact is lower than expected from a supposed ""3 and D"" wing. But the fact that he has not been particularly bad at anything came as a surprise at least to me and is a sign that he has had a solid season so far.

\-----------------------

**Jabari Parker** (25 GP, 32.0 MIN)

|\+ Points (18.5)|\- 3P% (28.9%)|
|:-|:-|
|\+ Rebounds (8.4)|\- Turnovers (3.1)|
||\- Assist / Turnover Ratio (0.84)|
|||
||\- RPM (because of -ORPM, -DRPM)|

Jabari's stats paint a fairly simple picture. He has been a good scorer (in terms of pure per 36 min numbers) and a rebounder, but he has been a bad three point shooter and has made way too many turnovers. Also, the RPM stats really don't like him because according to that methodology, he's been bad relative to the rest of the team (and obviously to the rest of the NBA) both offensively and defensively. My personal take is that even if the fit with the rest of the team is not taken into account, so far there are too few things in the ""plus"" column for him to be re-signed for the second year. If he can become a more efficient scorer or add something else to the ""plus"" column (although there is no chance it can be anything related to defense), then it perhaps would be a more a difficult decision.

\-----------------------

**Ryan Arcidiacono** (24 GP, 28.6 MIN)

|\++ 3P% (41.6%)|\- Points (9.7)|

|\+ +/- (-3.0)||
|||
|\+ NETRTG (because of +OFFRTG)||
|\+ RPM (because of + ORPM)||

Archie's shooting has been excellent so far. Together with a good amount of assists and very few turnovers, that translates into good advanced stat net ratings because of his good offensive ratings. Also, his +/- is one of the team's best. One of the only drawbacks I was able to identify is the fact that his points per 36 min figure is probably slightly too low for a PG in the starting unit no matter how much of a facilitator role he has assumed. However, that is due to low volume of attempts because his shooting has been great, so the potential is definitely there for him to become a larger and more consistent scoring threat. If he can maintain these sorts of shooting percentages  (or only have them slightly decline) while slightly increasing his attempts so he becomes a more relevant scoring threat for the opposing teams, he  could solidify his place in the NBA for years to come (assuming the start of the season has not been an outlier in terms of his performance).

\-----------------------

**Wendell Carter Jr.** (25 GP, 25.9 MIN)

|\+ Blocks (2.2)|\- Fouls (4.8)|
|:-|:-|
|\+ Rebounds (10.2)|\- 3P% (20.8%)|
|\+ Points  (15.9)||
|\+ Personal Fouls Drawn (3.9)||
|||
|\+ DRPM|\- ORPM|
|\+ PER||
|\+ PIE||

I think that WCJ's stats are also very much in line with this subreddit's consensus view on his performance so far. The blocks and the rebounds have been there and even the scoring which I think is very solid figure for a rookie. The fouls have obviously been a clear negative (some undeserved, but also some deserved). I also identified the three point shooting as a negative because the hope after drafting him was to have him be a true ""stretch five"" with a solid three-point shot. Obviously it's still very early in his career, but I think the low 3P% is a legitimate thing to note as a slight negative so far. He has good DRPM and player impact ratings which reinforce the view that he has been great defensively and has had an overall positive impact on the court.

\-----------------------

**Cameron Payne** (23 GP, 18.8 MIN)

|\+ Assists (5.3)|\- 3P% (27.5%)|

|\+ FT% (87.%)|\- +/- (-13.1)|
|||
||\-- NETRTG (because of - OFFRTG and - DEFRTG)|
||\- RPM (because of -DRPM)|

The one good thing has been the amount of assists and the good assist to turnover ratio (which might come as a surprise to some). However, his shooting has been bad and his +/- is by far the worst of the team. The advanced metrics really do not like Payne either with both offensive and defensive ratings being bad. I think that matches the ""eye test"" on his performance so far this season. Given the above stats, it is not a surprise this subreddit does not particularly like him... Also, the comparison between Archie's and Payne's good and bad stats should settle the issue whether they are of the same (or even similar) quality as players and whether the people here are just biased for Archie and against Payne for non-basketball reasons (not the case).

\-----------------------

**Chandler Hutchison** (21 GP, 18.5 MIN)

|\+ Rebounds (8.0)|\- Points (8.7)|
|:-|:-|
|\+ Turnovers (1.5)|\- TS% (47.9%)|
|\+ +/- (-3.6)|\- 3P% (22.7%)|
||\- FT% (65.2%)|
||\- Assists (1.4)|
|||
|\+ NETRTG (because of + DEFRTG)|\- PER|
||\- RPM (because of --ORPM, +DRPM)|

Hutch's good and bad stats are perhaps easiest to categorize / analyze out of all the players. To put it simply - he has been good defensively, but bad (or really bad) offensively. Hutch has rebounded well for a player in his position, he has taken care of the ball well with few turnovers, and his plus-minus is one of the best in the team. However, his offense has not been good due to his poor shooting percentages. Also, perhaps somewhat surprisingly, he has a low number of assists as well compared to the rest of the team and considering the position he plays. The advanced stats like him defensively but really rate him poorly offensively which makes sense given his poor shooting so far.  I think the stats support my personal view which is that he has shown a lot of potential in terms of the intangibles (BBIQ, effort etc.) and defense which are reflected in the plus-minus and DEFRTG, so if he can only fix his shooting, he will be a solid player in this league.

\-----------------------

**Antonio Blakeney** (23 GP, 17.0 MIN)

|\++ 3P% (44.8%)|\- Assists (1.1)|
|:-|:-|
|\+ Points (20.5)|\- Assist / Turnover Ratio (0.60)|
||\- FT% (63.6%)|
|||
||\- RPM (because of -DRPM)|

The ""story"" that the good and bad stats tell regarding Blakeney is unsurprising - his three-point shooting has been great and he is a volume scorer, but he never passes. Also, the RPM methodology rates him poorly defensively which also should not surprise anyone. The rest of his stats have been average. So perhaps there is more hope for Blakeney than some think - if he can increase the number of ""items"" in his ""plus"" column and pass slightly more, he should have a place in this league as a scorer in the second unit. However, realistically, the only items he could add to the plus column are shooting percentages, because he has no potential defensively or in terms of rebounding etc. so it all comes down to whether he can be an efficient scorer in addition to just being a scorer.

\-----------------------

**Robin Lopez** (18 GP, 16.6 MIN)

|\+ Blocks (2.1)|\- Rebounds (4.2)|
|:-|:-|
|\+ TS% (56.4%)|\- Fouls (4.3)|
|||
||\- PIE|
|\+ DRPM|\- ORPM|

There's not that much to say about Rolo. He has a good number or blocks and his shooting has been efficient. Rebounding (which does not take into account his boxing out etc.) and fouls have been problem areas. In terms of advanced stats, he has been good defensively but bad offensively. Overall, a lot of his stats are average, not good or bad.

\-----------------------

**Shaquille Harrison** (16 GP, 16.1 MIN)

|\++ Steals (3.6)|\-- 3P% (17.4%)|
|:-|:-|
|\+ Assists (4.5)|\- TS% (46.0%)|
|\+ Assist / Turnover Ratio (2.46)|\- FT% (63.2%)|
|\+ Rebounds (6.8)||
|\+ Personal Fouls Drawn (4.0)||
|||
|\+ PIE|\- NETRTG (because of + DEFRTG, -- OFFRTG)|

Like Hutch, Shaq has been good/great defensively, but his shooting has been poor. Shaq's number of steals is excellent, and perhaps a bit surprisingly, the number of assists and assist/turnover ratio are good too. He is also a good rebounder for a player in his position. However, since his shooting sucks, his NETRTG is negative because his good defense is outweighed by his even worse offense. If Shaq could become even just a mediocre shooter, I think he would definitely have a place in this league based on his stats so far.

\-----------------------

**Cristiano Felicio** (18 GP, 12.4 MIN)

|\+ Rebounds|\-- Blocks (0.3)|
|:-|:-|
|\+ TS% (61.6%)||
|||
|\+ OFFRTG|\- DEFRTG|

Felicio's lack of minutes and the fact he has played largely during garbage time probably mostly explain the lack of either ""good"" or ""bad"" stats. He's just kind of been there and that's it, he hasn't been particularly good or bad against the garbage line-ups in a lot of areas. His rebounding and TS% have been good while the amount of blocks for a center is pretty damn bad. The advanced stat ratings show that he has relatively more potential offensively than defensively which is not really a surprise.

But if a player was clearly better or worse than most of the roster in these categories, I gave them the + or -.

I also took the role of the player into account with certain stats like rebounds or 3P% (I'm not going to give Lopez a -  in 3P% because that's not what is expected of him but I did it give it to Zach because we expect better 3-point shooting from a player in his role). Finally, **the stats are based on per 36 minutes** and not per game so that the amount of playing time won't skew the comparisons.

*The statistics are from NBA.com (except RPM and PER statistics which are from ESPN).*

|\+ ORPM|\- DRPM|
|\+ PER||
|\+ PIE||

Zach's stats paint a picture that I think corresponds pretty well with the general narrative about his performance so far (in this subreddit, I feel r/nba has been more pessimistic than they should). He has been a great scorer which translates into good offensive ratings (and good player impact ratings) when looking at those advanced metrics. At the same time, advanced metrics rate his defense as bad (which should not come as a surprise). He has a good number of assists, but also too many turnovers, so it's a wash in terms of assists to turnover ratio. The three point shooting has been much worse than his historical average also.

\-----------------------

**Justin Holiday** (25 GP, 35.4 MIN)

|\+ Assist / Turnover Ratio (2.36)||
|\+ Steals (1.7)||
|||
|\+ RPM (because of +ORPM)|\- NETRTG  (because of -DEFRTG)|

I could not identify a single category where Justin has been worse than average / particularly bad. So maybe this subreddit has been slightly too critical of him? His shooting has been great this season and the low number of turnovers and the second highest amount of steals in the team are also positives. The RPM is also relatively good because of his offense. However, in a bit of contradiciton, his NETRTG is relatively bad because of a relatively bad DEFRTG so that could be a sign that his defensive impact is lower than expected from a supposed ""3 and D"" wing. But the fact that he has not been particularly bad at anything came as a surprise at least to me and is a sign that he has had a solid season so far.

\-----------------------

**Jabari Parker** (25 GP, 32.0 MIN)

|\+ Points (18.5)|\- 3P% (28.9%)|
|:-|:-|
|\+ Rebounds (8.4)|\- Turnovers (3.1)|
||\- Assist / Turnover Ratio (0.84)|
|||
||\- RPM (because of -ORPM, -DRPM)|

Jabari's stats paint a fairly simple picture. He has been a good scorer (in terms of pure per 36 min numbers) and a rebounder, but he has been a bad three point shooter and has made way too many turnovers. Also, the RPM stats really don't like him because according to that methodology, he's been bad relative to the rest of the team (and obviously to the rest of the NBA) both offensively and defensively. My personal take is that even if the fit with the rest of the team is not taken into account, so far there are too few things in the ""plus"" column for him to be re-signed for the second year. If he can become a more efficient scorer or add something else to the ""plus"" column (although there is no chance it can be anything related to defense), then it perhaps would be a more a difficult decision.

\-----------------------

**Ryan Arcidiacono** (24 GP, 28.6 MIN)

|\++ 3P% (41.6%)|\- Points (9.7)|

|\+ NETRTG (because of +OFFRTG)||
|\+ RPM (because of + ORPM)||

Archie's shooting has been excellent so far. Together with a good amount of assists and very few turnovers, that translates into good advanced stat net ratings because of his good offensive ratings. Also, his +/- is one of the team's best. One of the only drawbacks I was able to identify is the fact that his points per 36 min figure is probably slightly too low for a PG in the starting unit no matter how much of a facilitator role he has assumed. However, that is due to low volume of attempts because his shooting has been great, so the potential is definitely there for him to become a larger and more consistent scoring threat. If he can maintain these sorts of shooting percentages  (or only have them slightly decline) while slightly increasing his attempts so he becomes a more relevant scoring threat for the opposing teams, he  could solidify his place in the NBA for years to come (assuming the start of the season has not been an outlier in terms of his performance).

\-----------------------

**Wendell Carter Jr.** (25 GP, 25.9 MIN)

|\+ Blocks (2.2)|\- Fouls (4.8)|

|\+ DRPM|\- ORPM|
|\+ PER||
|\+ PIE||

I think that WCJ's stats are also very much in line with this subreddit's consensus view on his performance so far. The blocks and the rebounds have been there and even the scoring which I think is very solid figure for a rookie. The fouls have obviously been a clear negative (some undeserved, but also some deserved). I also identified the three point shooting as a negative because the hope after drafting him was to have him be a true ""stretch five"" with a solid three-point shot. Obviously it's still very early in his career, but I think the low 3P% is a legitimate thing to note as a slight negative so far. He has good DRPM and player impact ratings which reinforce the view that he has been great defensively and has had an overall positive impact on the court.

\-----------------------

**Cameron Payne** (23 GP, 18.8 MIN)

|\+ Assists (5.3)|\- 3P% (27.5%)|
|:-|:-|
|\+ Assist / Turnover Ratio (2.56)|\- TS% (48.9%)|
|\+ FT% (87.%)|\- +/- (-13.1)|
|||
||\-- NETRTG (because of - OFFRTG and - DEFRTG)|
||\- RPM (because of -DRPM)|

The one good thing has been the amount of assists and the good assist to turnover ratio (which might come as a surprise to some). However, his shooting has been bad and his +/- is by far the worst of the team. The advanced metrics really do not like Payne either with both offensive and defensive ratings being bad. I think that matches the ""eye test"" on his performance so far this season. Given the above stats, it is not a surprise this subreddit does not particularly like him... Also, the comparison between Archie's and Payne's good and bad stats should settle the issue whether they are of the same (or even similar) quality as players and whether the people here are just biased for Archie and against Payne for non-basketball reasons (not the case).

\-----------------------

**Chandler Hutchison** (21 GP, 18.5 MIN)

|\+ Rebounds (8.0)|\- Points (8.7)|
|:-|:-|
|\+ Turnovers (1.5)|\- TS% (47.9%)|
|\+ +/- (-3.6)|\- 3P% (22.7%)|
||\- FT% (65.2%)|
||\- Assists (1.4)|
|||
|\+ NETRTG (because of + DEFRTG)|\- PER|
||\- RPM (because of --ORPM, +DRPM)|

Hutch's good and bad stats are perhaps easiest to categorize / analyze out of all the players. To put it simply - he has been good defensively, but bad (or really bad) offensively. Hutch has rebounded well for a player in his position, he has taken care of the ball well with few turnovers, and his plus-minus is one of the best in the team. However, his offense has not been good due to his poor shooting percentages. Also, perhaps somewhat surprisingly, he has a low number of assists as well compared to the rest of the team and considering the position he plays. The advanced stats like him defensively but really rate him poorly offensively which makes sense given his poor shooting so far.  I think the stats support my personal view which is that he has shown a lot of potential in terms of the intangibles (BBIQ, effort etc.) and defense which are reflected in the plus-minus and DEFRTG, so if he can only fix his shooting, he will be a solid player in this league.

\-----------------------

**Antonio Blakeney** (23 GP, 17.0 MIN)

|\++ 3P% (44.8%)|\- Assists (1.1)|
|:-|:-|
|\+ Points (20.5)|\- Assist / Turnover Ratio (0.60)|
||\- FT% (63.6%)|
|||
||\- RPM (because of -DRPM)|

The ""story"" that the good and bad stats tell regarding Blakeney is unsurprising - his three-point shooting has been great and he is a volume scorer, but he never passes. Also, the RPM methodology rates him poorly defensively which also should not surprise anyone. The rest of his stats have been average. So perhaps there is more hope for Blakeney than some think - if he can increase the number of ""items"" in his ""plus"" column and pass slightly more, he should have a place in this league as a scorer in the second unit. However, realistically, the only items he could add to the plus column are shooting percentages, because he has no potential defensively or in terms of rebounding etc. so it all comes down to whether he can be an efficient scorer in addition to just being a scorer.

\-----------------------

**Robin Lopez** (18 GP, 16.6 MIN)

|\+ Blocks (2.1)|\- Rebounds (4.2)|
|:-|:-|
|\+ TS% (56.4%)|\- Fouls (4.3)|
|||
||\- PIE|
|\+ DRPM|\- ORPM|

There's not that much to say about Rolo. He has a good number or blocks and his shooting has been efficient. Rebounding (which does not take into account his boxing out etc.) and fouls have been problem areas. In terms of advanced stats, he has been good defensively but bad offensively. Overall, a lot of his stats are average, not good or bad.

\-----------------------

**Shaquille Harrison** (16 GP, 16.1 MIN)

|\++ Steals (3.6)|\-- 3P% (17.4%)|
|:-|:-|
|\+ Assists (4.5)|\- TS% (46.0%)|
|\+ Assist / Turnover Ratio (2.46)|\- FT% (63.2%)|
|\+ Rebounds (6.8)||
|\+ Personal Fouls Drawn (4.0)||
|||
|\+ PIE|\- NETRTG (because of + DEFRTG, -- OFFRTG)|

Like Hutch, Shaq has been good/great defensively, but his shooting has been poor. Shaq's number of steals is excellent, and perhaps a bit surprisingly, the number of assists and assist/turnover ratio are good too. He is also a good rebounder for a player in his position. However, since his shooting sucks, his NETRTG is negative because his good defense is outweighed by his even worse offense. If Shaq could become even just a mediocre shooter, I think he would definitely have a place in this league based on his stats so far.

\-----------------------

**Cristiano Felicio** (18 GP, 12.4 MIN)

|\+ Rebounds|\-- Blocks (0.3)|
|:-|:-|
|\+ TS% (61.6%)||
|||
|\+ OFFRTG|\- DEFRTG|

Felicio's lack of minutes and the fact he has played largely during garbage time probably mostly explain the lack of either ""good"" or ""bad"" stats. He's just kind of been there and that's it, he hasn't been particularly good or bad against the garbage line-ups in a lot of areas. His rebounding and TS% have been good while the amount of blocks for a center is pretty damn bad. The advanced stat ratings show that he has relatively more potential offensively than defensively which is not really a surprise.

\-----------------------

That's it! If you made it this far, you are crazy but I thank you!

"Watching the Pacers telecast last night, multiple people who worked with or coached with Jim Boylen declined to say a single good thing about him.  

The Pacers announcers, Chris Denari and Quinn Buckner, talked about the coaching change on many occasions, but did not once take the opportunity to say even a single good thing about him.  

They had a quote from Dan Burke, who is a LONG time Pacers assistant over several different head coaches, where the only thing he had to say was relating to how sad it was that Hoiberg was fired at all and bemoaning the unusual circumstances.  

He made no direct comment on Boylen.  

I have been following the Pacers closely since the 1986 season and I can say that this is HIGHLY unusual.  

On top of that, I never heard anything good bad or indifferent from the team when he was originally not re-signed. Which again was highly unusual.

"Maybe a little late for this post, but I‚Äôve noticed the past couple seasons that players talk to Boylen a lot more than they did Hoiberg. Like, if someone screwed up an assignment, they‚Äôd look over at Boylen, or they‚Äôd go to the bench, hi five Fred, then chat with Boylen before taking a seat. 

Boylen always looked to me like he commanded respect from the players. And his body language sitting there on the bench was always indicative to me of him being the guy calling shots. Fred‚Äôs style was to delegate to his assistants, but Boylen ended up doing the most.

"I was sitting down having a conversation with a bunch of my Knick fan friends the other night. We were conversing about the future of both the organizations.

I really don‚Äôt think so, I think our potential is exponentially higher. But then again the Knicks do have the best player from both sides in Porzingis.

"Edit: What standards will WE hold?

Some of us liked Fred, and some of us didn't. Fred excelled at (in my opinion) minor player development and culture-building with this young group. At the same time, he lacked great game planning, rotation development, and getting this group to play as a team (we've seen far too much hero ball). At least we never had issues running out of timeouts (Thibs. Del Negro.) or leaving important guys stuck in the corner (Del Negro).


What standards will we hold to Boylen knowing that a) he isn't the next great head coach and certainly won't do everything at a high level, and b) there aren't really any great candidates right now with proven ability at the NBA level. What should we be focusing on with coaching until 2020?


For one, I'd like to see more developed rotations (let's end the Payne and Blakeney experiments) and better rebounding schemes (we should not be running 5 back on all shots, especially as we get all our bigs back). We need better off-ball movement, and habitual long twos by Blakeney and Parker (among others) should also be worked out.

Now that we've covered that, I thought I might offer a few thoughts about the Hoiberg firing. I'm seeing a lot of comments that are confused and wondering ""what did management expect with this team and all the injuries?"" and things like that. So first off, *I don't think the team's record was a factor in firing Hoiberg.* I got the sense that they didn't think he was the coach for the future of the team, and the clock was always ticking on his tenure in Chicago. So they didn't expect Fred to be around much longer. But what about the timing, then?

People questioning why he was fired now when players are just coming back from injury are looking at it the wrong way round. To me, that is the very reason why. They're pulling the rug from under him before he has a chance to run into a few wins by virtue of getting people back healthy and have the confusion turn into backlash when people think he deserved to stay on. Now the focus and energy can turn to figuring out who the next guy should be and determining the next step without it leaking that they had a lame duck coach. 

As a non-Bulls fan, I'm not as close to it as you lot are, but I thought I might provide another perspective and potentially one from a wider context (if there is any, I hesitate to give GarPax *too* much credit). 

Keep Lauri and WCJ safe and may the White Mamba bless us all. ","Outsider's perspective on the Hoiberg firing First of all, fuck GarPax.

"With everyone hating on GarPax and saying the timing of the firing doesn‚Äôt make any sense, I wanted to offer a different viewpoint. 

From the perspective of the front office, after a 5-19 start with just about the worst injury luck, and with much of the NBA being competitive so far this season, it makes sense to commit to a tank this season. If the Bulls go .500 from here on out, they‚Äôll end up with a record of 34-48 - not good enough for the playoffs, but not a great draft pick either. 

The chance at a high draft selection is more valuable than continuing to give Hoiberg the benefit of the doubt, when he frankly hasn‚Äôt done anything to prove that he belongs as an NBA head coach. Add on the fact that Hoiberg seemed at times to resist the tank last season, and it makes a lot of sense. 

In short, the Bulls are committing to the tank this season. Hoiberg doesn‚Äôt have enough value to justify retaining him and endangering the tank, so he gone.

"Once upon a time, Bill Cartwright was a superstar at the beginning of his NBA career from 1979-80 to 1980-81 when he averaged 20+ points per game. His best overall NBA season is his rookie season when he averaged 21.7 points, 8.9 rebounds, 1.2 blocks, 8.1 field goals made and 5.5 free throws made as the starting center.

Cartwright's stardom was short-lived when he had four separate foot fractures that made him miss the entire 1984-85 season which led NY to draft Patrick Ewing in 1985, and the arrival of Ewing relegated Cartwright to the bench for pretty much the rest of his Knicks tenure, ending when the Knicks chose to trade Cartwright to the Chicago Bulls in 1988 in exchange for Charles Oakley.

The Oakley-Cartwright trade angered Michael Jordan because Jordan and Oakley were best friends off the court, and he antagonized Cartwright endlessly until Cartwright stood up to Jordan, and Jordan stopped.

His best season with the Bulls was in 1988-89 when Cartwright scored 12.4 points, 6.7 rebounds, 0.5 blocks, 4.7 field goals made and 3.0 free throws made within 29-30 minutes per game as the Bulls' starting center. In 1989-90, Cartwright averaged 11.4 points, 6.5 rebounds, 0.5 blocks, 4.0 field goals made and 3.2 free throws made within 30 minutes per game as the Bulls' starter at center.

Eventually, Cartwright would see his minutes and overall game play dip (attributed to a broken hand) as although he was still the starter at center, he averaged 9.6 points and 6.2 rebounds around 28-29 minutes in 1990-91, averaged 8.0 points and 5.1 rebounds in 23 minutes per game as he missed 18 games with a broken hand in 1991-92, averaged 5.6 points and 3.7 rebounds in 19-20 minutes per game in 1992-93 while missing 19 games with a back injury, and averaged 5.6 points and 3.6 rebounds in 18-19 minutes in 1993-94 while missing 40 games with more back pain.

As Cartwright declined at the end of his Bulls tenure, the starting center role was manned by Stacey King or Will Perdue whenever Cartwright missed time. But after Chicago traded King away to the Minnesota Timberwolves, Luc Longley eventually became the starting center in Cartwright's absence.

At the end of 1993-94, Cartwright became a free agent and teams interested in him were the Sacramento Kings, Houston Rockets and the Utah Jazz before he chose to join the Seattle SuperSonics for a two-year $5M contract with guaranteed money, so Longley was supposed to be the starting center for Chicago in 1994-95, but Will Perdue took that role instead, and Longley was a backup center before Chicago dealt Perdue to San Antonio in 1995 to allow Longley to emerge as a player.

Let's say if the Chicago Bulls decided to keep Bill Cartwright in 1994-95 instead of letting him go to Seattle, I have to wonder if Cartwright would remain the starter at center or be made to take a full-time reserve role as a backup center behind either Longley or Perdue.","Would Bill Cartwright have remained the starting center if he stayed in Chicago instead of signing with Seattle in 1994-95?

Hey I'm a Celtics fan and quite disappointed in Terry Rozier this year. He's played a little bit better as of late but he plays too selfishly. His facilitation skills seem subpar this season and he can be a liability on defense. All that said I think he may need a change of scenery where he has more space to be himself. I'd prefer a 3&D combo guard who can facilitate in exchange for Rozier. However there aren't too many trade partners for Rozier. Holiday looks like someone who can fit the bill but I don't really know what he plays like. I think a potential trade would look like Rozier and Yabusele for Holiday. I would add a second rounder if that's what it took but I highly doubt Danny Ainge would do that. What do you think about Holiday's play style and that trade?

"Bulls would need to go 35-23 (.603 win pct) for the remainder of season to give them a chance at making playoffs. There are only 9 teams in the NBA with a win percentage higher than .603 at the moment. 

Unless the Bulls absolutely blossom with Lauri, Dunn, and Bobby returning, the reality is we are too deep in a hole and will likely miss playoffs. 

Tanking is never good for culture, but should we try to hold out Bobby and Dunn as long as possible and just focus on more development? Even if we make the playoffs, we would likely lose to the Raptors, Bucks, 76ers, and Celtics. This being said, we should try to get as much talent as possible before setting out to compete. Look what Dallas did in getting Doncic- they are now already contending for the 8 seed in West. Similarly, we should try to add 1 more piece in Barrett, Zion, or Reddish before we try to contend. Holiday and Jabari aren't part of our long-term core in Dunn/Lavine/Lauri/Carter, and Hutchinson might not have the star potential to put us over the edge. Add a guy like Cam Reddish to that core and you suddenly get a team-friendly situation where Lavine is locked in on a sub-20 mil contract for 4 yrs, and every other young piece besides Dunn is on a rookie contract for at least 2 more yrs.

"In the spirit of /u/hayabusa and his positivity efforts (and in hopes of demonstrating I'm not a complete curmudgeon as some may suspect) I thought it'd be worth while to have a post where we talk about the silver linings that we have found from the dark injury cloud that hangs over this team at the moment.

I'll start in a place others may not expect: Jabari Parker

Jabari is coming off multiple ACL injuries and has looked like a player who played less the 60 games the last 3 seasons. If it were not for injuries to Lauri/Bobby, Jabari might not have been able to get the in-game reps he needed to play his way back in to shape and rediscover some of what made him a #2 overall pick if guys like Portis and Markkenan were in the lineup eating away at PF minutes relegating Jabari to just the SF role.

Put another way, this season could have been a complete disaster for Jabari, but given the injuries, he's been allowed to play through his slump and now seems to be rounding in to form a bit due to all the excess playing time and responsibility heaped on his shoulders.

We also were finally able to put the Cameron Payne debacle to rest with Kris Dunn out. I was worried we would not answer that particular questions satisfactorily enough by the end of the year if Cam Payne was playing back up behind Dunn for less than 15 minutes a night but since we got to play him as a starter the first month we got to see how overwhelmed he is in this league.

The only time I got the see the Bulls play was preseason here in Champaign at the Assembly Hall (State Farm Center now) and I was on the floor for the game. It was awesome. Young Derrick Rose, young Noah, Roger Powell Jr from that 05 Illini team was on the preseason Bulls roster, and they were playing against the Jazz with Deron Williams and Carlos Boozer and AK47. It was an amazing experience..


But now I'm experiencing my first United Center game. My seats are horrible. 300 Level, but I don't care. I get to see my favorite team play! Everyone should be healthy and bonus I get to see my favorite player of all time, Derrick Rose play and Taj too!!

His defense would greatly improve our healthy starting lineup to make it KD/LaVine/Luc/Lauri/WCJ, which would make it have 3 impressive defensive players (KD, Luc, and WCJ) and 2 outstanding scorers (LaVine and Lauri)

Obviously if we decide that we‚Äôre tanking we probably won‚Äôt make this trade, but what do you guys think?

P.S. I‚Äôm not a huge analytics guy, I mainly just watch Bulls games and look at some stats, but I know Luc is a good defender. However, I have no clue what his trade value is or what we should give up for him

"In the latest BullsHQ podcast, a point has been brought up about the idea of starting Lauri at the 5. They brought how Lauri's 20-pound muscle gain prior to the injury (I don't know how much he lost during injury, if any) and his mobility can prove to be a threat to other centers. He can be a stretch 5, a Brook Lopez type of center with the mobility of a young Dirk Nowitzki

Jabari, obviously, will not play the SF position as originally intended, but as we all know, he's much better at the 4. During the start of the season we saw Portis start at the 4; though it showed initial promise of potential, he later started to struggle offensively, which shows us that he may be more comfortable as a backup 4. Jabari's game has improved over the last few games; his scoring has improved, he seems to be shaking off the rust, and he seems to put some effort on defense (he still needs work but at least he's now trying, unlike what we saw initially). If this improvement continues then who knows?

I like WCJ, but the problem is he is prone to foul trouble, and this seems to frustrate him and affect his confidence. I think moving him to the backup 5 position would slow things down for him and allow him to regain confidence in his game, in addition to providing much-needed defense to the second unit. Rolo, as much as I like him, is a dying breed in today's NBA. He's become less mobile and I don't see him in our team in the long run. Felicio, well, we all know...

If Lauri is prepared to take the position of a starting center, we could eventually have a starting lineup of Dunn-LaVine-Holiday-Parker-Markkanen. Portis and WCJ would be a solid backup frontcourt. If Holiday continues to play well, we could use him as a trade piece to acquire more talent, hopefully a younger SF. If that fails, we may need to draft our future starting small forward in this year's draft as our supposed final piece.

What are your thoughts on all this?","Lauri as our starting center. In the latest BullsHQ podcast, a point has been brought up about the idea of starting Lauri at the 5.

"The Bulls are atrocious and we can all clearly see that. All the injuries dont help, but this team is a special type of bad. Assuming the Bulls get a top three pick(hopefully the NBA tosses us a bone and the first pick), they should avoid Zion. Yes, he is a FREAK of nature, but that doesnt always translate to the NBA, especially todays NBA.  He is 285lbs, which is crazy for an NBA player, and I dont see how his body will last over an 82 game season. He is too big for his own good, and I feel he won't be able to live up to the hype.  Cameron Reddish and RJ Barrett will fit better in the NBA, and I can see Reddish sliding in perfectly in our starting 5. Zion will create a logjam with Lauri and Wendell, which we don't need, since we already have too many big man.

"I haven't really been following the Bulls lately, but yesterday I was able to catch the Heat-Bulls game on WGN. I was surprised at how terrible they were playing. Antonio Blankeney and Shaq Harrison both seem like a lost cause on offense, just unable to hit any of their shots. Jabari doesn't seem like he's playing on a 20million dollar contract. I know there are injuries and we might have overhyped them. What needs to change or are we trying to get a top draft pick? Can't wait for the T-wolves game tonight. Any way we can package Cristiano Felicio for anything?","What's going on with the Bulls this year?

"I think this sub has some cool people and obviously the greatest mod team we could ask for. But compared to other subs of bad teams, we seem to be significantly more depressed, with less reason to be so. I've gone to other subs of truly bad teams (surprisingly few this year!) and taken a look at their Depression Factor in comparison to ours. My research is compiled below, keep in mind this is exclusively for the 2018-2019 regular season:

|*Subreddit*|*Happy Post %*|*Synopsis*|*Depression Factor (TM)*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|/r/AtlantaHawks|90%+|Shitpost gods, I can't even tell if half of their sub cares about wins or losses. Generally speaking the most advanced meme culture we have in the NBA subs. They show human emotion sometimes during major wins or losses, but their ""neutral day"" is filled with good posts and jokey good vibes.|***not depressed***|
|/r/Suns|\~60%|This sub is sad, but they are a bit funnier about their own shittiness, probably from years of conditioning. To counter this, they have massive upvote parties for just about anything exciting. ""Fuck Sarver"" posts are common, as are fuck Tyson Chandler posts, fuck Ryan McDonough posts... but I mean they have Booker and Ayton, so it's probably fine.|***kind of depressed***|
|/r/ClevelandCavs|\~30%|Their posts are split about 1/3 each in either depressing stats about how bad the team is, jerk posts about Cedi or Sexton, and LeBron posts. I am gonna count the LeBron posts as depressed ones for obvious reasons. I think there is an argument to be made that posts getting excited about Cedi Osman are depressing, too.|***very*** ***depressed***|
|/r/NYKnicks|\~80%|This one did not surprise me. The Knicks have been bad so long that is pretty much impossible for Knicks fans to feel pain. They had a very good draft by picking up Mitchell Robinson in the second round (WITH OUR FUCKING PICK) and Allonzo Trier as an undrafted rookie, and both show out constantly even in losses. KP and Knox's injuries barely affect them, nor does Dolan, because they take present successes in stride.|***undertones of depression but not outwardly visible***|

&#x200B;

And now, the moment of truth... the results of the deep dive into our very own subreddit:

|*Subreddit*|*Happy Post %*|*Synopsis*|*Depression Factor (TM)*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|/r/ChicagoBulls|\~20%|We as Bulls fans have plenty to be thankful for. We have a good young core that we didn't have to suffer years for, our biggest question mark, LaVine, is balling out this year, and we picked up another great rook. However, this's posts are worrisome. On one hand, we have hype posts for wins and good games from Zach, Arch, and Wendell. On the other, we are bombarded with injury progression posts for our injured reserve, MJ glory days posts, Rose glory days posts, fire Fred posts, fire GarPax posts, bad trade posts, play X player more posts, play Y player less posts, and, worst of all, Post-Game Threads that start hours early, all of which are incredibly depressing.|***extremely depressed***|

&#x200B;

This is a sad state for our beloved sub, and we as the second largest worldwide NBA fanbase behind the Lakers must do better than this. We have a uniquely large community, filled with brilliant folks from across the world, and yet the best we can muster out is posts reminding us of better times and complaints. The only sub that is comparatively depressed among bad teams is Cleveland, and they just had LeBron leave which feels significantly more understandable. We have no crippling contracts, all of our picks going forward, a seemingly decent coach, and a good core, something that none of the aforementioned teams can claim all of.

I'd like to stress is that **it is absolutely okay to be frustrated with the team, and this is not a post meant to attack those who are**. Your emotions are valid, your voices are heard, and an overwhelming majority of us empathize. However, compared to other NBA reddit communities, we are much harder to join as a group because of the air of toxicity and bitterness - we ought to change this to help foster the community before our guys hit their primes and the new fans come anyway.

I've assembled a small list of suggestions to change the overall temperament of the subreddit:

1. **Discussion posts about NBA prospects in the upcoming draft** \- outside of Zion hype posts, which are WELL worth mentioning, we have little-to-no engagement with guys we could be calling Bulls in the near future. **If you catch a college ball or Euroleague game and like a player, post about it!** It could be fun to see how they could fit with our roster, and if we should consider them in the draft.
2. **Interesting statistical deep dives** \- I'm very close to a number of people in real life known as ""The Fiefdom"" that breathed life into the Milwaukee Bucks online fandom by producing high quality, stat-oriented content in the form of podcasts, posts, tweets, and the like. Most were targeted at proving how incompetent Jason Kidd was as head coach, and to show the team's potential if they diverted from that formula. I don't believe we have a similar problem, **but if you're a person who digs numbers and analytics, and is gonna poke through them anyway, post some interesting things about the Bulls that you see!** Guys like Ryan and Wendell have outstanding advanced stats despite smaller box scores and that type of stuff is really nice to hear about. Guys like Jabari... don't, which can also be cathartic!
3. **Revitalize our meme culture** \- listen, we have to admit, after the Oatmeal saga of July-August 2018, we have not had much fun as a group in terms of making dumb shitposts. We have a pathetic image macro presence relative to our size - **there are 46000 of you fuckers, I know some of you are sharing and making memes with your friends.** Post them here too, even if they're shit - the voting system will naturally filter out the truly dumb content anyway.

I think we are a good community gathered around a good franchise with good and talented people among us, we just gotta keep our heads up and be more welcoming by posting stuff that you find valuable to either community camaraderie or team/player analysis. **We may be the most depressed team sub of all, but that does not have to be permanent!

"After the recent win against the Suns I have seen many people on the sub who were almost **blaming** the team for actually winning a game of basketball for the first time in ages.   


""Zion Williamson this, Zion Williamson that"", ""Why are we winning against a tanking team?"" etc. It seems to me like many fans are actually unaware of the important changes for the next year's draft.  


Unlike previously, the bottom 3 teams will now have an equal chance of winning the lottery (14%). Also, to put it into a broader perspective, a 6th seed will now have a chance of 9% to land a number 1 pick.  


Now, consider the following factor: when Lauri, Dunn and Portis come back, a better record is basically inevitable. The Bulls could have 2, maybe even 3 solid winning streaks over the course season. So as long as the main guys come back and stay fit it is an impossible task to just stay at the rock-bottom of the standings.  


With this being said, almost everyone from the Western Conference apart from the Suns is likely to finish with a better record than the Bulls. So as long as Chicago make sure they stay in the bottom 4 of the East by the end of the campaign, which honestly is doable even with some wins here and there, the percentages for the draft will be quite favourable.

"I‚Äôve been pretty down Blakeney all season. I think he is a Kobe level ball hog (without the Kobe skill) and he is below average on D. He takes more mid range 2s than Rip Hamilton. I would hate to play with the guy- he‚Äôs a black hole on Offense. With that said, he is one of the only bulls that consistently creates his own shot. 

I watch the Suns game with a friends who thinks    Blakeney should be apart of the future. I think my friends is crazy. Can a guy like that be on a good team? I think Blakeney best case scenario is a good stats/bad team starter (16/18 ppg). My friends point is that IF he can become more of a play maker he has value as a volume scorer/O threat. Not a bad point, I just don‚Äôt see anything in his game to make me think he wants to pass the ball. 

I feel like Blakeney is gonna play a decent amount this season so I guess we will see. What do you guys think?","Antonio Blakeney thoughts... I‚Äôve been pretty down Blakeney all season.

"Looking at the [wing free agents in 2019,](http://www.basketballinsiders.com/nba-salaries/nba-free-agents-2019-2020-2/) it doesn't seem like Bulls can grab a quality player out of that list. 

#The Leets
Klay Thompson, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard and Kevin Durant aren't coming here. 


#Khris Middleton
My hope was Khris Middleton could be available. But with how well he and the Bucks are playing, I doubt Khris, Budz and the Bucks will part ways. Khris and Giannis are likely the foundation of that Bucks team in their finals pursuit.


#Young Projects
I'm also done with all these Bulls reclamation projects that didn't pan out. So no to Jeremy Lamb, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Allen Crabbe, Alec Burks and all these under performing wings who will demand a chunk of money.


#Vet mentors for rent
I always love the idea of getting vet mentors. Luol Deng, Danny Green, Jared Dudley and Kyle Korver are some names that could fill in as placeholder for starting position. But their going to cost more than a minimum. They will also take playing time off our long term prospects.


#Desperate Options
Over paying the likes of Harrison Barnes and Terrence Ross will be Bulls desperate options. But I'm not ready for that either.


#2019 NBA draft
Looking at [SI.com mock draft](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/11/20/nba-mock-draft-2019-zion-williamson-rj-barrett-nassir-little-keldon-johnson), Bulls need to get at least a top 12 pick(I don't believe Bol Bol will be top 12) to have a legit shot at least to the likes of SEKOU DOUMBOYA and De'Andre Hunter. It would be much better if Bulls can get a top 10 pick or better. By becoming the 6th worst team in the league, Bulls have a legit shot at a top 10 pick.

"I was just reading comments on a FB live video from the Bulls training today where so many people were commenting about firing Hoiberg. I personally am in the camp of actually giving him a chance. His first year he inherited Thibodeau‚Äôs team. His second year, he was given Rondo, Wade and Butler as his big 3. Had as much space as a Harry Potter‚Äôs bedroom. And last year he was dealt with an injury-riddled, rebuilding squad, a very similar situation he finds himself in this year.

For those that don‚Äôt really like Hoiberg, I‚Äôd like to give you some statistics from when Niko was lighting it up last year, a period in which, Lauri and Zach were injured for the most of. From Dec 8th to Jan 20th, the Bulls ranked 3rd in pace, 4th in assists, 2nd in made 3 pointers and 3 point percentage, and they were the fastest offensive team in the league. This was all with Zach playing only a few games, KD and Lauri missing games and our front offices sitting players. 

He also seems like a good coach for a rebuild. Seems to be a good teacher and well tempered enough to deal with young players and letting them play through mistakes and learn from them. Obviously he‚Äôs not perfect but he seems like a good coach both from a system perspective and the actual coaching players part. 

I guess this was less of a question post and more of me just saying this shit to get it off my chest because I don‚Äôt want to comment this on Facebook. But god a lot of people on the Bulls Facebook page are fucking stupid. Half of them know less about basketball than us and we‚Äôre fucking idiots compared to most of the people actually in the league.

"As usual, there are a lot of hyperbolic comments about the Bulls on various social media sites. Daily, I read everything from ""We are making the 8-9 seed once our injured players come back"" to ""We are never going to be competitive ever - the front office has given me no reason to believe we are"" but, hardly ever, do I read anything that seems to align with the way I view this team so I wanted to open up some discussion on where I think we are currently and why I think we will be competing for a championship in approximately 2-3 years. 

&#x200B;

Many of the previously negatively viewed FO decisions such as the Butler trade and LaVine signing have begun to make more sense as time has gone on and most of the fanbase that was originally opposed to these ideas have made their peace with them. Though, a few of the major criticisms of the FO over the last few years (that haven't been resolved by any sort of logic) have been the signings of Wade-Rondo, Payne, and Parker. For the sake of brevity, I will try to explain these quickly because I think they have a lot to do with what the long-term plan was at the respective times of their signings.

I believe the FO made the decision to start a 5-year rebuild during the 15-16 season. At the end of the season they attempted to trade Butler and were not able to secure a trade that they deemed adequate while also knowing that Wade and Rondo were available to them. I believe that they held out an additional year to get more value from Jimmy, thus, we ended up with a move that seemed to go against everything that we were told prior to that as to which direction the team was going. 

&#x200B;

Tanking is not what most make it out to be. It is not going out and intentionally losing games and it is no longer sitting your stars out.  It is a premeditated action that begins in the front office, trickles into the team, and is eventually poured onto the fanbase. You cannot tank with positive value players on your team unless you counter their talent with extremely bad players. In order to beat the horrendous teams in this league in the tank you have to have cunning and a terrible roster. Enter Cam Payne. We got rid of Taj and Doug who would have undoubtedly been too good for the tank for a player that, prior to us signing him, was shooting .331 from the field and .308 from behind the arc for a TS% of .402. Not only that, but he had been getting worse every year he was in the league. This was a smart tank move. By giving up value and making it look like we have an investment in him that we need to protect, they secured the rationale to play him as much as possible for the next few years. This is similar to what they did with Parker this year. Parker is a very talented offensive player and a great guy but has consistently had terrible defense and has had 2 ACL injuries. All indications showed that he was going to be a negative asset and contribute to losing this year but, because we paid 20m for him, the FO has the excuse to play him several minutes every game. In the past, we have always been known for our scrappy defense, I refuse to believe we threw that mindset away but we can't play defense and lose games like we need to so defense is going to wait until we are competing when we bring in defensive players. 

&#x200B;

When our core comes back from their over-extended rehabilitations we are undoubtedly going to be much better but it is important to note that with several negative value players that highlight the weaknesses of this team (defense) it is still going to be difficult to win games. If we end up in the bottom 7 teams we will have > a 31% chance of ending up in the top 4. On top of that, it is within the realm of logical thought that we will trade a future first to move up if we have to. God willing, we will have a top-3 pick this year but as long as we end up with a good pick we are going to have the tools necessary to really start building this team with the kind of talent that it takes to be competitive in this league. During the upcoming offseason I think we are going to see a lot of our team being traded and cut while we bring in solid role-players. Next year, Dunn (assuming he signs a new contract), LaVine, draft pick, Lauri, and Wendell are going to make the playoffs - there is no doubt about it in my mind. This is when we are going to really know our strengths and weaknesses and show the league and free agents that we are a good team. \*This is also when AD will be available and I can't help but to salivate over having a front-court that always has 2 of the 3 of Lauri, AD, and Wendell on it at any time. Did you see how LaVine was talking to him the other day? It looked just like the infamous LeBron/Lonzo talk from last year.\* Anyways, even if we don't get AD I think we will make the pickups we need, have the proper development for our young players, and in approximately 2-3 years from now be in contention for a championship and consider the FO's rebuild a successful one. ","The Art of the Tank and Why We Have a Great Future As usual, there are a lot of hyperbolic comments about the Bulls on various social media sites. Daily, I read everything from ""We are making the 8-9 seed once our injured players come back"" to ""We are never going to be competitive ever - the front office has given me no reason to believe we are"" but, hardly ever, do I read anything that seems to align with the way I view this team so I wanted to open up some discussion on where I think we are currently and why I think we will be competing for a championship in approximately 2-3 years. 

&#x200B;

Many of the previously negatively viewed FO decisions such as the Butler trade and LaVine signing have begun to make more sense as time has gone on and most of the fanbase that was originally opposed to these ideas have made their peace with them. Though, a few of the major criticisms of the FO over the last few years (that haven't been resolved by any sort of logic) have been the signings of Wade-Rondo, Payne, and Parker. For the sake of brevity, I will try to explain these quickly because I think they have a lot to do with what the long-term plan was at the respective times of their signings.

For me, it's Jabari setting for long 2's off the dribble.

Yet, he normally settles for jumpers that he hardly ever makes. Even worse, whenever he pulls it off, it's early on the clock and you can say that he didn't even tried to survey the floor.

His 4 assists to 4 turnovers per game isn't ideal either as the main ball handler.

I have a queation about a trade oportunity. I am genuinely curious what you guys think...

Philadelphia 76ers are in win now mode, and we are most definitively not. We are still in the middle of the rebuild.¬†

What  do you think how high opinion do the 76ers have on Zhaire Smith? Do  they have big plans for him in the future? He is curently injured and  won't be back until january, and probably won't have big contribution  this season...I'm not even sure if they wanted to trade him... 76ers lost Covington in the Butler trade and they are  looking for a shooter. Holiday has similar stats as Covington this season and is shooting decently. He is not as good as Covington on defense but that's why they have Butler now...

I think Holiday is not a part of the future, and we will try to trade him at the trade deadline. We can have Valentine to take his place after he is gone...

"As we've seen lately, RoLo seems to be back to the rotation.

Since Felicio has failed to establish himself into our rotation, Fred has put RoLo back and he has delivered so far. I have forgotten how much I used to love RoLo's game, he does so many dirty little things that doesn't fill up on the stats sheet such as boxing out, setting hard screens, getting offensive rebounds, etc.

It's a fact that RoLo is becoming an odd man in this era, he doesn't shoots 3, he's slow, etc. You can't (or shouldn't) play him against the top teams of the league. That's why I think trading RoLo might be tough, the only kind of teams that I can think that would be interested are the Spurs and the Jazz, so I'd rather keep him for a while.

But here is where the thing gets tricky: once Lauri and BP comes back, we would have 5 players for 2 positions. So, either RoLo is pushed back to DNP or anyone start losing time.

Of course it would be possible to mix line-ups based on the situation. Defense? Go with RoLo. Offense? Go with Bari and BP. But at some point Fred will have to make a choice.

Personally, I'd rather keep RoLo and dump Bari. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate him, I just think he doesn't fit, some of his stats can be deceptive and he's not the best influence in our locker room. Besides, RoLo has been a great veteran and mentor to our team.

So, what are your thoughts?","Let's talk about RoLo As we've seen lately, RoLo seems to be back to the rotation.

"Edit: Mild takes 


1. Zach can literally take over a game. All eyes were on him even in the first quarter when he wasn‚Äôt scoring that much. It was clear in the fourth quarter and in overtime that he was the best player on the court. This was an amazing pick up for the Bulls because I truly believe that he can get much better at defense and will get craftier as a vet on offense. 

2. Cam Payne looks just as bad in person as he does on TV. Super slow, always late on his decision-making, takes shots that no one wants him to take, and all-around sucks the energy out of every possession that he‚Äôs involved in. I know we have to pay him, but he‚Äôs not helping us win and we‚Äôre also not going to see any improvements by giving him playing time. Maybe they want him to look decent for a trade in a few months.

3. Felicia also a step behind on almost every play. 

4. WCJ is Jesus Jr. in my book. 

5.  Blackeney could be good as a volume bench scorer. Dude is nasty on the J‚Äôs and swoops. 

6. Pete Myers is emotional on the sidelines the whole game. 

7. Knicks fans are for the most part all quiet fair-weather fans. UC is way better than MSG. 

8. Can‚Äôt wait to watch the bulls at nets in February. Barclays is awesome. 

9. This team is awesome and I‚Äôm excited for the future as our core gets better.

"I think it's definitely possible, though the Bulls are gonna have to win a few more games if he's gonna get the coaches selection.

Not a whole ton of competition in the east, I'd say Lowry, Oladipo, Kemba, and  definitely gonna make it, Ben Simmons and Kyrie likely as well. Bradley Beal and John Wall both have a decent chance, though like the Bulls, they probably need to start winning more for that to happen.

I'd put it a little under 50/50 that Zach makes it, but if he keeps scoring efficiently and the Bulls can put some wins together, I wouldn't be surprised to see him there. 

What do you think?

"Story time: I moved from Chicagoland to Minneapolis/St Paul for graduate school right at the same time that the Timberbulls transformation was happening.  I'm a Bulls fan for life, but the Bulls were tanking, and on limited graduate student time I decided to not waste my time watching bad basketball. 

Fast forward to know and I am done with school, and the Timberwolves are falling apart and becoming a frustrating team to watch. Meanwhile, the Bulls are still terrible, but Wendell Carter looks like the real deal, and Zach LaVine is doing pretty damn good. I think this is the season where it switches over from  bad basketball, to bad basketball but with interesting players to watch.

"First off, let me say, that I love Jabari as a person; I think he is an MVP of the community and I want to see him succeed and will root for and defend him whether or not he‚Äôs in a Bulls uniform - I just think he may have been brought here for business reasons and I‚Äôm not sure what the future holds for him. 

In July, we brought Jabari on to ‚Äúplay the 3‚Äù. He played about 25% of his time at the 3 for the Bucks so it wasn‚Äôt beyond the realm of possibilities at the time despite the obvious defensive drawbacks. The only information that we have gotten since then was that ‚ÄúHoiberg shelved the idea‚Äù with the media taking on the narrative that the decision was made because Jabari was a lost cause at the 3. One important note here is that only occurred after Markkanen was injured - it‚Äôs possible that they would have still tried to play him at the 3 when the season started if we weren‚Äôt in need of another power-forward. 

Now, I‚Äôm of the belief that picking him up was a quick asset grab; we struck out on making a deal for a bad contract, had the cap space, he was to come in here as the hometown kid, score a lot of points (I thought he would put up 20 ppg in this system), sell tickets, help to lose games (my opinion but they knew what his defensive deficiencies were prior and what matching him up with other poor defenders would do and I think the FO wanted to secure a good draft pick while having a big-name offensive player), and ultimately be traded, dropped, or signed to a much cheaper contract unless completely turning around his lackadaisical tendencies (or physical issues) and becoming a long-term asset.

So here we are, 10 games into the season and about a month or so from Lauri coming back. I think we can say with fair confidence that he will be playing backup to Lauri at the 4 at that time but when Bobby comes back in approximately 1 and 1/2 months, we are going to be left with a $20m asset that imo WILL SEE significant playing time, most likely at the FO‚Äôs request, that should not be getting time at the 4 over Bobby. I understand that BP will be spending time playing the 5 but with Wendell and even Lauri needing their time at that position, BP is going to see limited time there. So, either we are going to see Jabari eat up some of Bobby‚Äôs minutes at the 4 or eat up Hutch‚Äôs and Holiday‚Äôs or possibly all three. One alternative scenario, is that Holiday is traded around the deadline which should be right around the time Bobby comes back and will free up time at the 3 while still giving Hutch the time to develop that he needs. 

Of course, these are just my opinions and tinfoil-hat theories. So I‚Äôm curious, what do you think Jabari‚Äôs role will be on the team after BP and Lauri are back?","The Curious Case of Jabari Parker First off, let me say, that I love Jabari as a person; I think he is an MVP of the community and I want to see him succeed and will root for and defend him whether or not he‚Äôs in a Bulls uniform - I just think he may have been brought here for business reasons and I‚Äôm not sure what the future holds for him.

"Hello everyone. Last night's game was a blast to watch even though a lot of our best player's were out injured. I feel confident that we have three young guys (Lauri, Zach, and Wendell) who can lead us in scoring on any given night. In addition to Kris Dunn, Denzel Valentine, Bobby Portis, and Chandler Hutchinson, we have a great young core going forward. A few of our players definitely have All-Star potential.

I think everyone is in agreement that this team desperately needs a starting small forward. Someone who can play good defense and can add offense when we need him to. So if you take a look around the league, who would you want to add to this Bulls team? Assuming that Jabari and all the other expiring guys are gone next year and that Bobby signs for (at the most) 15 million a year, we would have 68 million commited to players on the roster, and with the projected cap being 109 million next year, we would have about 41 million in room to work with (not including cap holds, I don't know anything about those). 

So who should the Bulls add? Any trade ideas for the trade deadline this year? I have mentioned before in comments that I would like Harrison Barnes or Otto Porter in a trade, but another guy I like is TJ Warren from Phoenix. He plays good defense and is shooting well from 3 this year, and he is under contract for around 11 million for the next 4 years. With Phoenix having Josh Jackson, Trevor Ariza, and Mikal Bridges, they don't really need Warren anymore for their future. There also guys such as Stanley Johnson or Bojan Bogdanovich that are worth taking a look at next summer.

What do you all think? I want to hear your ideas!","[Discussion] Who would you want to be our future starting small forward? Hello everyone.

"We're going to be pretty good when Lauri and Dunn come back. I think Lauri and Carter Jr. can form a pretty strong defensive pairing together. Not every team has 5 good defenders and if those two can at least reach their potential on defence then I think we'll be at least average.

Carter Jr. too having a very solid game matched up against one of the best C in the league. Think if he can grow an inch or 2 he would turn in to one hell of a player. Also really impressed with Blakeney's ability to influence the game from the bench. Literally scoring with 4 seconds left with a half court drive at the end of the 3rd with a dunk.

Parker looks like he's getting better every game. Still missing a few suspect shots but doing pretty well on the offensive end. Think he's been making more of an effort on defence too, instead of vacating the paint he tries to rebound the ball. LaVine is pretty much our out and out best player right now, I can't wait to see what him and Lauri can do together.

Few bullshit calls on Arci too. Is a solid 3rd choice PG. Payne is also a decent backup for Dunn too and I see him doing well against most teams 2nd units.

Also some credit to Hoiberg too, we're running pretty nice plays which are giving us plenty of options, we just seem to be bricking open looks.","Just finished watching the game We're going to be pretty good when Lauri and Dunn come back.

"I‚Äôve been going though a really tough time in my life these past couple months. Without getting into much detail, life threw me a huge curveball and I‚Äôve just been struggling so much to stay positive and keep fighting. I feel defeated and find it so hard to stay motivated sometimes. But the one thing that keeps me going is my drive, and my strong belief that I‚Äôll get through it someday. 

Derrick Rose has always been my childhood idol. He was the one that got me to watch basketball. He was the one that made me such a huge bulls fan. I vividly remember coming home from school and being so excited to watch the bulls game whenever they were playing because I wanted to see what Derrick Rose would do. I loved the passion and the drive he played with. He always inspired me to work hard and to be passionate about what I‚Äôm doing, because that‚Äôs exactly how he played on the court. 

When he got injured year after year, it was really heartbreaking for me because I absolutely loved watching him play. I never got to see Jordan play because I wasn‚Äôt born during his era, but seeing DRose play was such an amazing thing. His first injury was really sad but every time he got injured after that was even sadder because it made me realize that he might never return to his MVP form ever again. I was always waiting for him to return, and always checking the latest news on his injury reports but sadly, MVP Rose never returned to the Bulls. When he finally got  traded to the Knicks, it was so disheartening for me because that represented the end of his journey with the Bulls. He had tried so hard, and had put everything he had into returning to MVP form, but sadly, he just wasn‚Äôt able to do it. It seemed like he was destined to always be injured and that his MVP days were behind him for good.

Well turns out that Derrick Rose didn‚Äôt give a fuck about everyone that doubted him. He continued to work hard every single day and never gave up on himself. Even when he kept on failing, he kept on trying and trying and never lost hope. 

Today, Derrick Rose scored a career high 50 points. Words can‚Äôt express how happy I am for him, as a fan and also as a human being. This guy has been through hell and back and is STILL out here living his dream.

His interview made me so emotional because it represented the fact that you should NEVER give up. No matter what. Even when it seems like life is constantly trying to put you down, if you try your hardest to hold your head up, you WILL get through it. Life had thrown Derrick Rose so many curveballs but he STILL got through it. 

Seeing my childhood idol go though all this and still make it through gives me so much hope. It fucking sucks that life though me such a huge curveball, but I will get through it because I‚Äôm going to put my head up and keep fighting no matter what. 

Derrick Rose has inspired me in more ways than anyone can imagine. He may just be a basketball player to some, but he represents something far greater to me.

Thank you Derrick Rose. You will always be my idol. 


EDIT: Thank you so much for the support everyone. Truly means a lot to me. Love how tight knit our bulls community is üî•üî•üî•","That D-Rose interview meant more to me than anyone can ever imagine I‚Äôve been going though a really tough time in my life these past couple months. Without getting into much detail, life threw me a huge curveball and I‚Äôve just been struggling so much to stay positive and keep fighting. I feel defeated and find it so hard to stay motivated sometimes. But the one thing that keeps me going is my drive, and my strong belief that I‚Äôll get through it someday. 

Derrick Rose has always been my childhood idol. He was the one that got me to watch basketball. He was the one that made me such a huge bulls fan. I vividly remember coming home from school and being so excited to watch the bulls game whenever they were playing because I wanted to see what Derrick Rose would do. I loved the passion and the drive he played with. He always inspired me to work hard and to be passionate about what I‚Äôm doing, because that‚Äôs exactly how he played on the court. 

When he got injured year after year, it was really heartbreaking for me because I absolutely loved watching him play. I never got to see Jordan play because I wasn‚Äôt born during his era, but seeing DRose play was such an amazing thing. His first injury was really sad but every time he got injured after that was even sadder because it made me realize that he might never return to his MVP form ever again. I was always waiting for him to return, and always checking the latest news on his injury reports but sadly, MVP Rose never returned to the Bulls. When he finally got  traded to the Knicks, it was so disheartening for me because that represented the end of his journey with the Bulls. He had tried so hard, and had put everything he had into returning to MVP form, but sadly, he just wasn‚Äôt able to do it. It seemed like he was destined to always be injured and that his MVP days were behind him for good.

Well turns out that Derrick Rose didn‚Äôt give a fuck about everyone that doubted him. He continued to work hard every single day and never gave up on himself. Even when he kept on failing, he kept on trying and trying and never lost hope. 

Today, Derrick Rose scored a career high 50 points. Words can‚Äôt express how happy I am for him, as a fan and also as a human being. This guy has been through hell and back and is STILL out here living his dream.

His interview made me so emotional because it represented the fact that you should NEVER give up. No matter what. Even when it seems like life is constantly trying to put you down, if you try your hardest to hold your head up, you WILL get through it. Life had thrown Derrick Rose so many curveballs but he STILL got through it. 

Seeing my childhood idol go though all this and still make it through gives me so much hope. It fucking sucks that life though me such a huge curveball, but I will get through it because I‚Äôm going to put my head up and keep fighting no matter what. 

Derrick Rose has inspired me in more ways than anyone can imagine. He may just be a basketball player to some, but he represents something far greater to me.

Thank you Derrick Rose. You will always be my idol.

&#x200B;

Ok... Before you say anything, I know... He is a bust...

But let's review this...

&#x200B;

Bender is 20years old, 7-1, 225lb, PF/C. He was 4th pick in 2016 draft. In my opinion he came too early from Europe. He didn't prove himself in Europe like Donƒçiƒá, or even ≈†ariƒá did. He was hurt for half of his rookie season and he didn't adapt like everyone expected from him. He didn't show anywhere near enough talent he was suppose to. And overall in these two seasons he was a disappointment, and he didn't show that he is 4th pick material. 

But he showed flashes of decent defense and there was few really good games last season. But to be honest he played for a really bad tanking team and under two not so good coaches. And if we can get him to sign a team friendly 1+1 prove-that-you-can-play-in-nba contract, maybe he can be useful. I can see him as a backup center to Wendell. Maybe if he improves on defense, and most importantly on offense, and grows some muscle maybe he can become a good piece for us.

Last season he averaged 6.5 pts, 4.4 reb, 1.6ast, 0.3stl, 0.6 blk, 1.4 tov, with .366 3P%.

So far he has been a bit better Felicio but with 3pt range...

&#x200B;

I mean he is still really really young guy, with only 20 years old (21 in a month), but with two seasons experience in nba. We are still rebuilding.  Maybe if we can give him a chance with another veteran signing to mentor him and Wendell, maybe we could have something here... 

His favorite player is Toni Kukoƒç, so maybe he could help him with some advice or coaching...

&#x200B;

What do you guys think about Bender? Would he be worth our time and spot on the roster?

It also doesn't seem like he just let his teammates bump up his efficiency, as he played with several combinations that got him the plus efficiency.

"If you look at the Bulls' first 6 games, out of the 4 losses there were 2 close losses and 2 games where we hung around and lost the game in the second half. Against the Pistons we lost by two and we would have most likely won that game if Kris Dunn was available and took away a couple of Detroit's 18 threes they made with his defense. Against the Mavs Dunn was at 50% because he had not slept or practiced with the team in several days and got injured in the 3rd quarter. Offense from Lauri and Denzel could have pushed us over the top in points needed and a healthy 100% Dunn could have helped guard the screen and rolls that killed us in the 4th quarter.

"Pls. Don't be mad this is just my opinion I know a lot are going to be pissed but again this is my OPINION anyways feel free to comment.

1. Parker and portis is the same age but Parker is 1 month younger so age shouldn't factor the bulls decision.

2. Parker and portis can really only play 1 position and that is the Pf because jabari is too slow as the three and portis defense is definitely not enough to be a center plus with lauri already being the starter and the future of course we don't need to pay almost 40 to two guys who practically play the same position as our second best player.

3. Parker earns 20 mil a year which he shouldn't have but portis will probably ask for something like that or something close like 16-18 mil and for about 4 years at least jabari is good for 2 years and if he wants to stay with the bulls he can be cheaper for around 12-16 mil a year.

4. Jabari is perfect for the bench since he's a good all around player just no defense but portis isn't good as well anyways but Parker is a better shooter, passer, and can stretch the floor. Which makes him the better player. 

5. Lastly, portis is much higher in the market right now over jabari since Parker has a bad injury reputation.

PS. I want to keep portis but it's better to trade him since we could get something we desperately need for this team having him and jabari as the backup 4 and 5 is atrocious since they both look to score. 

Although still we really haven't seen this team's full potential yet, so this is pretty much a reach. 

One more thing I love bobby that's why I want him to be in a team that really needs him more. (ex. Celtics, jazz, pacers, thunder because they need scorers and those teams are good on defense which can help portis on his defense)

"With KDs impending free agency and talks he might be leaving the Warriors, do you think the bulls stand a chance at landing him? We have the cap space, and we definitely have the fit with our need for a wing. Dunn, LaVine, KD, Lauri, and Wendell would be a crazy starting 5, not to mention we‚Äôd be able to retain Portis easily with his bird rights, Hutchinson and Valentine would also be able to stick around as bench contributors, and we‚Äôd still have this years draft pick.

I don‚Äôt know, I know it‚Äôs not likely, but the fit is there, the opportunity is there, and being able to trot out three 7 footers, two of which feature elite shooting alongside Zach‚Äôs scoring prowess and Dunn + Wendell‚Äôs defense would be insane, especially with the young guns (hopeful) continued development and the crazy lineup flexibility KD could provide with his ability to effectively play up to the 4 as well.

"The talk that Lebron is the GOAT is ridiculous. And is purely motivated by Lebron's handlers and Nike/ABC/ESPN trying to maximize profits.  

But facts are facts.  And Lebron is benefiting from the current NBA rules like no other.

Did you Know:  That Lebron is below average at every single spot on the floor EXCEPT in the restricted area?

1. Career 34% 3FG.  That is below average for a perimeter player for his era.

2. Mid range.  37% FG.  Again well below average.

3. Free Throws. 74%. Again below average.

4. Paint (non-restricted area) 42%. Below average.

The only spot where Lebron has an above average FG% is in the restricted area where he shots 73%.  And Lebron takes 36% of his shots there.

So how can a player be literally below average everywhere on the court except for a small 3 foot semi circle be the GOAT?  He can't. Because teams can easily adjust to shut down that small area.  Unlike Jordan who was elite nearly everywhere on the court.

So what did Lebron do?   He twisted the game to fit his needs.

1. He forced his Center's to become spot up 3-point shooters.  That way the paint would be absolutely empty, so Lebron could continue to dominate at the rim.  Although this juiced up Lebron's efficiency and scoring, it hurt his team.  Guys like Bosh and Love were elite inside/outside players.  But to appease Lebron they had to sacrifice 50% of their game.

2. Load up his team with shooters. Shooters everywhere.  Again this is so the paint is empty and teams can't send a double team at Lebron.  If a team double teams then Lebron will make a simple pass to a wide open 3-point shooter.  Many times Lebron's teams play shooters even though they are crap on defense.  Lebron does not care.  Because good shooters juice up his assists numbers and gives him the spacing to score at the rim.

3. Don't waste energy on defense.  Lebron has been absolutely horrible on defense the last 2 years.  And has not been an elite defender for much of his prime. But who cares?  The media does not care about defense until they care (bash Harden but give Lebron a pass). No stats can currently give an accurate measurement of a players defensive value.  So Lebron continues to play crap defense. He basically plays a 1 man zone in the paint and does not close out on shooters. Then he grabs a ton of uncontested rebounds.

So what would happen if Lebron played on a team with a Center who could not space the floor?  On a team that is not loaded to the gills with 3-point shooters?  You get the 2018/2019 Lakers.

Its no surprise that Lebron is shooting only 46% FG and 16% 3FG this year.  He no longer is getting the red carpet treatment to the rim.  He actually has to finish over PF/Centers in the paint, instead of attacking an empty paint.  Its early but he is only shooting 62% FG at the rim, which would be his lowest since his rookie year.  Last year he shot 77% at the rim and 78% the year prior. Did Lebron just become a way worse finisher? Or are teams able to leave a big in the paint.

Its crazy that the so called GOAT has to have an ENTIRE TEAM build around him to be successful.  He needs his Center and PF to be parked at the 3-point line.  He needs his Point Guard to be 'off the ball' so he can stacked up assists.  He needs both of his guards to be 3-point marksmen.  While everyone else on the team is required to provide spacing for Lebron, the rest of the team suffers because Lebron provides zero spacing for them.

Lebron is not even close to being the GOAT.  

His game is extremely limited.  He is only elite in the restricted area and no where else.  He is basically a Russell Westbrook who can finish at an elite level at the rim because he's 6'8"".  And even his ability to finish at the rim can be minimized if he does not have a stretch 4 and 5.  And for the last 8 years he has had the benefit of having at least 3 All NBA players on his teams and play in the weak east.  Lets see how far he gets in the West without 3 All STars on his team.","Why Jordan is still the GOAT The talk that Lebron is the GOAT is ridiculous.

His game is extremely limited.  He is only elite in the restricted area and no where else.  He is basically a Russell Westbrook who can finish at an elite level at the rim because he's 6'8"".  And even his ability to finish at the rim can be minimized if he does not have a stretch 4 and 5.  And for the last 8 years he has had the benefit of having at least 3 All NBA players on his teams and play in the weak east.  Lets see how far he gets in the West without 3 All STars on his team.",29,32,Why Jordan is still the GOAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/9r2pqc/why_jordan_is_still_the_goat/

"http://www.tankathon.com

This website gave me the remedy to my Bulls blues last year... and as much as dislike the notion of tanking this early into the season, I‚Äôm ready to make this one of my most visited websites again. 

At this rate, I feel our only hope for a winning season is the return of our Young GOAT Lauri. I am all in favor of abandoning the tanking notion in the case that Lauri drives us to the playoffs. That would be epic. 

However, I‚Äôm preparing for the worst. I think Hoiberg took out the starters way too early last night against Dallas which prompted me to believe Bulls have some intention with landing a top lottery pick again. Plus team president Michael coming out and saying he has no expectations for playoffs this year stirred the pot. 

Leading up to this years draft, I emphasized how we needed to get Lauri a big man counterpart as there were many big man available. I think we landed the perfect yin to Lauri‚Äôs yang this year in WCJ. If we land a top lottery pick this next draft, we can land our final piece to the new core in a draft class loaded at our position of need, SF. 

I‚Äôm excited to follow college hoops again through the lens of a fan scout. Right now I‚Äôm in the boat of:
*Crying for Zion* (I know he‚Äôs more of a 4 but he looks athletic enough to play 3 and will allow for Lauri to flow more around the perimeter). 

There‚Äôs also duke counterparts RJ Barrett and Cam Reddish. As well as rival UNC, Nasir Little. And wild card from Europe, Sekou Doumbouya. 

These 5 guys are who I‚Äôll be paying attention to as season unfolds. At this rate, we need the most complete player; lock down D and glue guy on offense. 

I really don‚Äôt like the notion of ‚Äútanking‚Äù 
I hope Bulls really do focus on player development and do what they can to win as many games. Which even if they do go in with win now mentality, there‚Äôs a high chance they will still land in lottery. With all that being said, let‚Äôs shock the world with a playoff run !

"I was so hyped for the start of this season, and even though I'm still enjoying having an abundance of games to watch on a daily basis I have some deep concerns for this great game.

One would think my attitude would be a reflection of the Bulls poor start, but that couldnt be further from the truth! I'm enjoying seeing our young core go through the growing pains and still believe we have a great future ahead if development and some luck go our way!

So what am I talking about then you may ask? Well it's that mythical beast that seems to have become extinct over night! Yeah the beast called defence!

WTF has happened? Are we experiencing Ground Hog day, and forced to watch the All-Star game over and over again?

We have Draymond coming out (and at least he is honest) stating that defence isn't an emphasis anymore, and with the way the rules have changed and the calls the refs are making scoring is becoming the only aspect that matters!

I love the game of Basketball so I really hope this is just a phase, and the game naturally restores some balance as the season continues.

One question to finalise this post, with all the soft fouls favoring the offense, is it time the NBA allows ""hand checking"" back in the game?

"I have noticed in the last few weeks this sub's opinion of GarPax has completely flipped. Maybe it's just the people that were criticizing them have not been posting as much but there seems to be a lot of support for them. I want the people who support them to honestly comment below on why this is the case. Needless to say I really don't believe in GarPax and here's why:  


**Major points of support for GarPax:**

\-They traded away Jimmy, who has created a terrible situation in Minnesota.

I don't think that GarPax really deserve a lot of credit for getting good trade value for a superstar like Jimmy. Obviously his attitude is a major concern right now but you can always find good value in the NBA when you're trading away your franchise player in his prime. 

\-They have drafted really well recently as Lauri and Wendell look like future studs.

I give GarPax a lot of credit for how they have drafted recently, but this never really was an issue with them. They've had some misses (Marquis Teague, Tony Snell, etc.) but for the most part, they have always been very good at drafting players given the position they were picking in the draft. Still, they haven't turned that into a consistent title contender.

\-They got value in a trade for Derrick Rose who wasn't a very good NBA contributor at that point.

&#x200B;

The problem I have with GarPax isn't really anything that was listed above. I always approved trading away Jimmy Butler before giving him a max deal with all the minutes he's played and I will never try to say they don't typically draft well. What I am critical of them for is almost everything else regarding talent acquisition and building a team:

&#x200B;

**Major points of concern for GarPax:**

\-The only ways they have acquired players worth building a championship team around is through dumb luck.

You could argue Jimmy can't be the best player on a championship team, but look at how the bulls drafted their two superstars in the GarPax era. They had a 1.7% chance of winning the lottery and drafting Rose. Before that, they were a team that had found talent in the draft while not drafting particularly high and not tanking (Kirk Hinrich, Luol Deng, Joakim Noah), but were a middling team in the east and lucked into getting the best player in the draft. They also drafted Jimmy with the 30th overall pick which again, they deserve credit for drafting well, but they were a little lucky. The probability of getting a player of Jimmy's caliber with a pick that late is very, very low. Listen to the post draft press conference after they draft Jimmy. GarPax thought that at best Jimmy could be a good role player.

\-The Jimmy and D-Rose trades are the only trades they have really won.

The trades the bulls have made over the years can be a little baffling. Doug McDermott for Gary Harris and Jusuf Nurkic? Doug McDermott, Taj Gibson and a 2nd for Cam Payne? Tony Snell for MCW? Mirotic for Hutchison and Asik's terrible contract? They aren't getting really any value for players in the trade market unless they're trading away a great or recently great player.

\-The moves in free agency and players they have acquired rarely fit with the team's best players

Carlos Boozer was a mess defensively and was outplayed by Taj Gibson. Pau Gasol was better than Boozer, but still really hurt their defense which was the strength of the team during the Thibodeau years. They signed Wade and Rondo after saying they wanted to get ""younger and more athletic"" and both of those players didn't fit with Jimmy. They signed Parker when the team was already going to be bad defensively, and Parker's best fit is at the 4 where Lauri and Portis are already there and playing well. What major free agent signing have they made where they got a player who really fit the team well and complemented the best players?

&#x200B;

If you made it to this point in the post thanks for reading. This is really to demonstrate my point of view and to have people who support them share their point of view and why they disagree. GarPax have always drafted well, but when it comes to building a cohesive and productive team they have been a complete disaster. I don't see signs of that changing soon.","Opinion of GarPax I have noticed in the last few weeks this sub's opinion of GarPax has completely flipped. Maybe it's just the people that were criticizing them have not been posting as much but there seems to be a lot of support for them. I want the people who support them to honestly comment below on why this is the case. Needless to say I really don't believe in GarPax and here's why:  


**Major points of support for GarPax:**

\-They traded away Jimmy, who has created a terrible situation in Minnesota.

"Is anyone else feeling like Hoiberg isn't going to be the guy to get us to the next step? I don't mean next step as in Championship, I mean being a competitive team with good winning culture. I don't want to bash on the guy, he has some good offensive schemes that work in the modern NBA but he doesn't seem to instill the discipline required to consistently win day in and day out. Too many times over the last few years I've seen these new bulls lazily go for rebounds several times on the same defensive possession, only to not come up with the ball. Or, seeing our big guys look confused guarding the pick and roll. I know that our big men aren't defensive stoppers, but they should at least be familiar with how to defend against this basic play even they don't get the stop. PnR is effective which is why it's used but we should be better, at the very least looking more comfortable with a set every other team knows we're weak at.  


I wouldn't want to go back Thibs-esque type of coaching but the players need to be held accountable for the mistakes that are within their control and now have become habitual. I love Bobby but this past game I seen our shot go up with him standing in the corner and the long rebound went into his general area, which was towards the other end of the floor anyways, without him even making a move towards it until the other team had secured the ball and began their fast break. I'd make him sit for that. That's a mentality issue caused by culture, not by lack of ability. Our players need to play with some reckless abandon, and it won't happen under Hoiberg.

the thing is jabari was always a bad defender. bit not this bad. he was just plain bad before, these two games were taking that badness on another level. his defensive rating in the last 3 years howered around 110 - 111 which isn't good, but through these two games it was 118, which is an equialent of an old lady with arthritis trying to guard michael jordan. his lack of effort is frustrating, but he lacked it during his bucks years too, so he'll probably revert to his old self in a few months. his defensive +/ minus droped from - 1.6 with which you can live to abysmal -7.1 which is abysmal. 

he isn't only bad on defense, he's horrible on offense too.  his ofensive rating dropped from 107 - 111 to 91. to me this indicates a player that is still strugling to find his form after the injury. parker showed that he can be a very good player when healthy, and we should give him minutes (and support) to find out if he can become the player he was two seasons ago (and maybe improve, he's still 23). cause there is a big deficit in talent on this team, and jabari has talent. if he sucks after 30 games his minutes should be lowered but for now... it's not like this team will win 50 games.

He doesn't hustle. He doesn't know where to stand. He never looks around to see where his matchup is standing, dude just stands and stares until the ball flies straight into his hands. It was already noticeable in the preseason but I thought he'll get more serious about it once the season starts. He didn't. The cherry on top was when he got outrebounded by Fultz.

Don't get me wrong I wish him so hard to succeed here and I know it's only been one game. But this is not a simple post injury/ lack of skill/ rhythm issue. This is an attitude issue.

"Hello fellow Bulls fans,

With the season mere minutes till tip off but our bulls of course have to wait a little longer I just wanted us bulls fans to share our predictions for the season. What do you think our final record will read? Can we sneak into the playoffs if everyone stays healthy/improves? Who will be our most important player/most improved?

I for one am excited to see how Wendell Carter Jr plays as he had a solid preseason but the regular season is a completely different ball game where you can fall just as hard. 

I think we could see a lot of improvement overall with a full season of LaVine with Dunn growing as a player and hopefully Jabari Parker shows why he got that contract but it‚Äôs tough coming of such a rough injury not once but twice and if he gets some starts but Valentine is also a solid player for us and can have a big leap. 

How will our young core develop. 

I think being hopeful hitting the 40 win plateau would be a pretty good season and in the east you can pretty much get into playoffs with that. 

My predictions

Best case Scenario

Final Record 43-39

Worst case

35-47

MVP: LaVine (Lauri depending if he bounces back after the injury)

I‚Äôll be watching religiously throughout the season despite the big time difference but that doesn‚Äôt come between me and the love of the bulls so many questions but I‚Äôm really excited to share the ups and downs hopefully with all of you guys. Interested to see what you guys think and Let‚Äôs Go Bulls!!","Predictions for the season ahead Hello fellow Bulls fans,

I'll give you a randomizer spin and add you to the fun. If anyone has suggestions on improvements or whatnot, let me know! So, the rules:

3. I will make one thread a week (or even every 2 weeks, we will see) and we will give a paragraph or more on how our (probably shitty) team is doing. Doesn't need to be hardcore analysis, just some observations.

That's pretty much it. If the mods, for whatever reason, has some issue with this just let me know and we can figure it out. Hopefully this doesn't qualify as spam or whatever since it's once every week or so. And yeah, if anyone is interested in following another team this season just message me and I'll add you.

"Wendell Carter Jr. has quietly had an outstanding preseason. He continues to impress with a feel for the game that belies his 19 years of age. He has far outperformed all other Bulls bigs on D this preseason and by all indications is absolutely ready for a starting role.¬†In this post I will take a look at where Carter has the potential to make the biggest impact - on defense.

Carter finished the preseason averaging 7 points on 45.5% FG% to go along with 5.6 rebounds and 2.2 assists, in 21 minutes of action. Those numbers may not pop off the page, but his positive impact runs deeper than simple counting stats. His +2.8 plus/minus was tops on the team, and he also had the best offensive rating AND defensive rating out of all rotation players, with a net rating of +6.7.

##Defense

Carter is already a very polished defender with the length and smarts to make an impact. He understands the concept of positioning very well, has a high motor to get to his spots, and has the traditional height and length for a center.

###Rim Protection

The most impressive thing about Carter's game may be his defensive IQ at such a young age.

[rim protection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHklahYBMNQ?rel=0)

Watch him pick up Paul Millsap off the switch, keep up with him on his drive, absorb contact while Millsap tries to create space, and contest the shot into a miss. All without fouling. Also, look at him sprint down to the other end of the court in transition. Even though he doesn‚Äôt get the ball, he helps create that open look for Holiday as the Denver defense must take him into account.

In the third and fourth clips, Carter recognizes that the opposing player has his man beat, and protects the rim beautifully. Look at how quickly he gets to the rim, followed by his length as he jumps straight up in the air, arms above his head. His positioning is key here as he aims to get to the spot first, then contest the shot.

In the last clip, Carter demonstrates great rim protection against Giannis and shows he isn‚Äôt scared to challenge one of the NBA‚Äôs best athletes. However, he‚Äôs a little late on the rotation and gets called for the foul. If he rotated to the rim a second earlier, he would‚Äôve been in better position for the contest. Still, great stuff from the rookie.

###Help D

Carter has displayed great awareness in his help defense aside from the usual rim protection typically expected from centers.

[help D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCjEh-v1r0?rel=0)

In the first clip above, watch Carter leave Will Barton to help on the Jabari-Jokic mismatch. Although he didn‚Äôt actually help contest the shot, his presence at the rim helped the Bulls secure the rebound as Holiday did not box out his man Millsap. It‚Äôs the small things like these that don‚Äôt necessarily show up on the box score, but over time add up and affect the game in a very real way.

In the second clip, look at Carter‚Äôs recognition of the mismatch and quickness in getting over to contest. He forces the miss but his man comes in for the putback jam - Portis should‚Äôve seen Lopez coming and boxed him out.

The final clip is amazing and shows his defensive IQ. Carter and Dunn get forced into a switch, leaving Carter on Jamal Murray and Dunn on Jokic on the high post. Carter recognizes the mismatch and keeps his eye on Jokic. As soon as he notices Jokic's head is turned, he swipes the ball and gets the steal. Again, look at him take off down the court in transition.

###PnR Defense

Carter shows great positioning defending the pick and roll - he‚Äôs ready to contain the guard‚Äôs drive or contest the shot, but also enough space to return to his man. This is a great sign for the Bulls as PnR defense is so important as a big man in today‚Äôs league. Take a look at some examples of his pick and roll defense below.

[PnR defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SxWfBx0pTo?rel=0)

In the last clip, he had good positioning on the initial pick and roll, but needed to make more of an effort to box out to avoid the tap out by Turner. On the Collison drive, watch Carter stunt at him to bait the pass before committing to the contest. On the other end, he ran the floor well, but the finishing is still a work in progress.

Also important for a big man defender is their ability to switch out onto guards or wings and stay in front of them. Carter has the footspeed and lateral quickness do this with relative ease.

[switching onto guards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZrCTBx7pcM?rel=0)

Look at how well he contests Murray‚Äôs shot, and his lateral quickness in preventing the Jeremy Lamb baseline drive. The Bulls have to be excited about Carter‚Äôs pick and roll defense, which is is light years beyond anything Robin Lopez is capable of providing.

###Improvements

Although Carter has shown a great understanding of help defense, there are times where he shows uncertainty in committing to help.

[improvements1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk_psgRK8uI?rel=0)

I should mention that this is completely normal for a rookie - in fact, it‚Äôs remarkable that this is the exception, not the norm. He hasn't played a real NBA game yet. With time and increased reps, he will make these mistakes less often.



[improvements2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA8Ae6EZCeM?rel=0)

Carter has shown a bad tendency to get caught in the air trying to contest a drive, or biting on pump fakes. This takes him out of the play and often leaves his man open under the basket, forcing his teammates to cover for him. The second clip illustrates exactly that. Also, on the very next possession, Carter over-helps on the pick and rolls and leaves his man wide open for the layup.

The last clip is a great designed play by the Pacers, using Oladipo‚Äôs scoring threat to bait Kris Dunn into the screen resulting in a 2-on-1 under the basket. How could it have been slowed/stopped? If Carter doesn‚Äôt bite on the Collison pump fake, he has an extra second to return to his man, making that entry pass into Turner a little more difficult.

###Conclusion

As the season progresses and his confidence increases with each game, expect Wendell Carter Jr. to continue to grow into his role as defensive anchor. With his ability to spread the floor as well as the versatility he‚Äôs shown in his post game, he can be a positive force on both ends of the floor this season. Carter may not have a flashy game, but he has the tools to make a big impact on this Bulls team.","A Look at Wendell Carter Jr.'s Stellar Preseason Wendell Carter Jr. has quietly had an outstanding preseason. He continues to impress with a feel for the game that belies his 19 years of age. He has far outperformed all other Bulls bigs on D this preseason and by all indications is absolutely ready for a starting role.¬†In this post I will take a look at where Carter has the potential to make the biggest impact - on defense.

Carter finished the preseason averaging 7 points on 45.5% FG% to go along with 5.6 rebounds and 2.2 assists, in 21 minutes of action. Those numbers may not pop off the page, but his positive impact runs deeper than simple counting stats. His +2.8 plus/minus was tops on the team, and he also had the best offensive rating AND defensive rating out of all rotation players, with a net rating of +6.7.

##Defense

Carter is already a very polished defender with the length and smarts to make an impact. He understands the concept of positioning very well, has a high motor to get to his spots, and has the traditional height and length for a center.

###Rim Protection

The most impressive thing about Carter's game may be his defensive IQ at such a young age.

[rim protection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHklahYBMNQ?rel=0)

Watch him pick up Paul Millsap off the switch, keep up with him on his drive, absorb contact while Millsap tries to create space, and contest the shot into a miss. All without fouling. Also, look at him sprint down to the other end of the court in transition. Even though he doesn‚Äôt get the ball, he helps create that open look for Holiday as the Denver defense must take him into account.

In the third and fourth clips, Carter recognizes that the opposing player has his man beat, and protects the rim beautifully. Look at how quickly he gets to the rim, followed by his length as he jumps straight up in the air, arms above his head. His positioning is key here as he aims to get to the spot first, then contest the shot.

In the last clip, Carter demonstrates great rim protection against Giannis and shows he isn‚Äôt scared to challenge one of the NBA‚Äôs best athletes. However, he‚Äôs a little late on the rotation and gets called for the foul. If he rotated to the rim a second earlier, he would‚Äôve been in better position for the contest. Still, great stuff from the rookie.

###Help D

Carter has displayed great awareness in his help defense aside from the usual rim protection typically expected from centers.

[help D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCjEh-v1r0?rel=0)

In the first clip above, watch Carter leave Will Barton to help on the Jabari-Jokic mismatch. Although he didn‚Äôt actually help contest the shot, his presence at the rim helped the Bulls secure the rebound as Holiday did not box out his man Millsap. It‚Äôs the small things like these that don‚Äôt necessarily show up on the box score, but over time add up and affect the game in a very real way.

In the second clip, look at Carter‚Äôs recognition of the mismatch and quickness in getting over to contest. He forces the miss but his man comes in for the putback jam - Portis should‚Äôve seen Lopez coming and boxed him out.

The final clip is amazing and shows his defensive IQ. Carter and Dunn get forced into a switch, leaving Carter on Jamal Murray and Dunn on Jokic on the high post. Carter recognizes the mismatch and keeps his eye on Jokic. As soon as he notices Jokic's head is turned, he swipes the ball and gets the steal. Again, look at him take off down the court in transition.

###PnR Defense

Carter shows great positioning defending the pick and roll - he‚Äôs ready to contain the guard‚Äôs drive or contest the shot, but also enough space to return to his man. This is a great sign for the Bulls as PnR defense is so important as a big man in today‚Äôs league. Take a look at some examples of his pick and roll defense below.

On the Collison drive, watch Carter stunt at him to bait the pass before committing to the contest. On the other end, he ran the floor well, but the finishing is still a work in progress.

Also important for a big man defender is their ability to switch out onto guards or wings and stay in front of them. Carter has the footspeed and lateral quickness do this with relative ease.

"I personally think the Bulls are ready to take a big step this year and will far exceed the projected win totals currently set. I have my hopes high with a 40+ win season and a playoff berth. I really believe Zach is poised to take the next step and WCJ will be the best 2-way player from this recent draft. Our biggest hole and position really holding us back is a dynamic wing and Otto Porter would be a great addition for the Bulls going forward. I'll admit, I don't know how Wiz fans feel about Porter so I apologize in advance if I offend you with any low ballery. Washington has a bit of a cap problem (payroll currently at 140.6 million) for a team coming off 43 wins in the East and still has 92 million+ locked up for their core over the next three years. Young players like Kelly Oubre will soon be looking to get paid as will the Bulls Bobby Portis. A trade of Otto Porter in exchange for Robin Lopez, Justin Holiday and Bobby Portis would clear up nearly five million for Washington who could also buy out Lopez and Holiday getting them closer to that 123.7 million luxury tax line. Washington would then be left with the option to resign Portis and Oubre, having cap room heading into next season. The Bulls, would be taking a bit of a risk.... Porter has a player option for 20-21, as does Anthony Davis. In a perfect world, Porter and AD can decline their player options and become free agents in 2020 and the Bulls would be in a prime spot to sign two guys to big deals while still having Lavine, Lauri and WCJ on the books and could likely buy out Felicio if he hasn't by some miracle been traded or bought out by then. Again, not sure if Washington would even entertain this and picks could certainly be brought into the equation, but I like this timeline for Chicago and I think it would set us up nicely for free agency and contention in 2020-2021.
