You should really try it, if only this game. They are free to watch (you need League Pass for live viewing)  
  
Because you're really into the game mentally, switching the view from viewpoint is a bit weird at times since you have to reorient your mind a bit. The plays are awesome to watch from underneath the basket.
  
I also like the camera on the scorers table where players continuously pass by closely after time outs of when they sub in. At som point Rondo is fidgeting with the sticky floor pad right next to you.  
  
 I found myself reaching out to the players for a high five at the end of the half where the camera is in the tunnel.

"LeBron seemingly has no chance against the Warriors in the foreseeable future with the team as constructed. The Cavs have no realistic option to add a significant player via FA as they are way over the cap. Essentially the only way for the Cavs to get LBJ a title during his final prime years is a trade for a really good player.

&nbsp;

Enter the Bulls who are going no where with Butler and in no way can compete with the Warriors in the next 3-4 years. Everyone always talks about the Celtics and their great rebuilding move with trading KG and Paul Pierce to the Nets for #1 picks

&nbsp;

What if the the Bulls ""punted"" the next 4 years (while the Cavs and Warriors duke it out) and trade  Butler for a boat load of #1 picks and pick swaps starting in 4 years? I'm talking 2 First rounders starting '20 and '22 with pick rights to swap in '21 and '23 (possibly throw in '25 swap as well). The Bulls would get to rebuild now and also great future investments by getting a shit ton of #1 higher draft picks when the Cavs are on the down trot.

"Looks like Bulls brass told Denzel Valentine he'll have a bigger role next year. That could mean a few things, but given his skills, it may mean they want to try him more at point guard. They let him have the reins when he was in the D-league, and assuming Rondo comes back and starts, there's still no concrete backup option at PG. I thought Valentine should've gotten more run when Rondo went down and Grant/MCW failed, but Hoiberg likely wanted more experienced hands out there at the time.

Bulls always come out to play against the Cavs and I feel like whenever we play it turns into a gritty grind it out kinda game that throws the Cavs out of their rhythm and slows down pace. Also Jimmy def gives LeBron more problems than anyone else in the East short of maybe PG. To be fair I think at best it would still be Cavs in 5 where we manage to steal game 1 as we always have in past years somehow but still more competitive than it is right now.

"#The Trade

**The Chicago Bulls trade Jimmy Butler & Bobby Portis + 2017 2nd round pick for the Sacramento Kings #5 & #10**

*Why would the Kings make the trade?:*

> Jimmy Butler is a star. Not only is he a monster on the court and fills a need, but Jimmy instantly brings back relevancy to Sacramento and helps them become a potential hotspot for free agents in the future. Bobby Portis also fills a need and could potentially lockdown the starting position on the team.
>
>Collison / Hield / Butler / Portis / Cauley-Stein
>
> Not a terrible line up heading into free agency with all the capspace the Kings have. With Butler on the roster, the Kings have a good chance at landing one or two of the top free agents this offseason. This could possibly turn the Kings into a contender a lot faster than suffering any more years of mediocrity waiting for their rookies to develop in hopes they don't end up bust.

*Why would the Bulls make the trade?:*

> The window is just about shut for the Bulls and they need to start preparing for the NBA post-Lebron. Jimmy Butler's value is higher now than it will ever be going forward. The Bulls could either choose to be mediocre and waste Jimmy's prime by building around him with free agents who *might* see a Eastern Conference finals, while potentially putting the franchise's future in jeopardy, or they can be bold and just rip the band aid off and go all in on a rebuild.
>
> Having 3 first round picks in one of the most stacked drafts in recent history could shave years off a rebuild all in one night. If this trade were to happen, I could realistically see the Bulls being competitive 2-3 years. If these prospects are as good as I think they are, I wouldn't be surprised if this roster made a playoff appearance next year.

#The Draft

**5. Jayson Tatum - SF - Duke**

*Why Tatum?*

> Tatum is arguably the best SF in this class and would help fill the void left by Butler. Jayson is one of the most complete forwards I've seen in awhile. This kid has game on both sides of the ball just like Jimmy, he might not be as good as Butler right now but he has the potential to be even better.

**10. Frank Ntilikina- PG - France**

*Why Ntilikina?*

> Ntilikina would be a top 5 pick if this class wasn't so stacked at the position. The Bulls need a PG, but more importantly, they need a guy who can shoot and create space on the floor. Ntilikina fits the bill.

**16. Harry Giles - PF - Duke**

*Why Giles?*

> Before the injury Harry Giles was arguably a top 5 pick in this year's draft. Seeing how this is the Bulls 3rd pick, they can afford to swing for the fences and take the guy who has the highest ceiling in the late teens.

#The Free Agents

**Plan A: Blake Griffin**

*Why Griffin?*

> Hopefully DWade can have his buddy Chris Paul put in a good word for Blake Griffin to come to Chicago if the Clippers aren't willing to pay top dollar after a season of injuries and having an issue with one of the equipment staff managers that lead to him breaking his hand. Wade won't be around forever so we're going to need to bring in a star who can lure in free agents in the future even if that means paying a max contract. 

**Plan B: Serge Ibaka**

*Why Ibaka?*

> Ibaka is still in his prime and fits Hoibergs system in what he wants out of a PF. With how weak the market is at the position I expect the Raptors to overpay to prevent him testing the waters.

**Plan C: Paul Millsap**

*Why Millsap?*

> Millsap is by no means the future but he would play a key part in it by mentoring the young guys. Just like Ibaka, Millsap fits the bill for what Hoiberg wants out a PF and could help the Bulls compete while playing a key part in Giles development.

**Plan D: Nikola Mirotic**

*Why Mirotic?*

> After the top 3 PF's,  Mirotic has the highest upside out of the remaining guys and is familiar with the system. Hopefully they wouldn't have to resort to plan D but it isn't the worst thing to happen.

#The Roster

**Rondo** / Ntilikina

**Wade** / Valentine

**Tatum** / Zipser

**Griffin (Other)**/ Giles

**Lopez** / Felício

#The Summary:

> There it is, pretty much a complete rebuild in one offseason with all that's left is the development of the rookies. Could the rookies bust? Sure. But if you have 3 picks in the top 16 then there's a good chance at least one of those prospects is a gem. Even *IF* the Bulls busted 2/3 they're still in a great position moving forward. If you get at least one star in his early 20's at the cost of a star who's about to be 30 than you won the trade. What if two end up stars? Hell, what if all three reach their potential and you have a young dynasty on your hands? IMO these are the best moves the Chicago Bulls could make this offseason, so you can expect GarPax not to do this. But it's fun to imagine ""what if...""","Make The Chicago Bulls Great Again. #The Trade

"I've read plenty of times that Reinsdorf is a loyal guy.  I get that in the case with Krause (6 championships) and Kenny Williams for the Sox (won a World Series).  However I can't seem to understand why Reinsdorf would be so loyal to Paxson and Forman?  

&nbsp;

Considering in Paxson's 14 year tenure here the Bulls have only made it to one Eastern Conference Final (where they were gentlemanly swept).  He's clashed with almost every coach that's came here (Skiles was fired on Christmas, he choked Del Negro, we all know the story with Thibs, and now it seems Hoiberg is getting thrown under the bus).  How is a successful coach supposed to come here when they know the last 4 have been torn to shreds?  

&nbsp;

People say the Bulls draft well.  I get that.  They have found diamonds in the rough with Butler and Taj.  They've also drafted solid role players in Noah, Deng, BG and Kirk.  They also drafted Rose.  However Paxson and Foreman have long overvalued their own and fail to capitalize on the trade market when an opportunity is presented.  The front office notoriously pitches the the fanbase ""the core"" but fails to sign a major FA which leaves the Bulls in good enough to compete but not be seriously considered for a championship.  People also fail to realize that before Rose was drafted, the Bulls were headed in the direction of overpaying for BG and progressing with a core of Hinrich, BG, Deng and Noah.  That #1 pick bailed out the Bulls from being in no-mans land from 2008 - 2012.  

&nbsp;

In short, the only reason why I can think that Reinsdorf would be ""loyal"" is the drafting capability of finding solid role players (other than Butler ; Rose was a gimme) but its been 6 years since anyone of significant value was drafted.  Otherwise in every other fashion, these two front office executives have been considered average or below average by peer standards","Why do Paxson and Forman still have jobs?

"Hi guys, now that our season is ended and we are left in the land of costant disappointment and confusion that our great managers has put us into our only bright sport in the near future will be the draft, so what is our situation?

I would say our biggest flaws right now are at pg and 4 what can we get in the draft to cover those?

At 4 I think there isn't a lot of choice: Markannen is going away way before our spot, what else could we ge? Can the forward of this draft like Miles Bridges Jackson or Tatum be able to play the 4 at the next level? I honestly don't know and would like some feedback.

So we get to the pg position, this is where things get interesting this year draft is stacked at the pg position, we have Fultz Ball Fox Ntikilna and Smith

Fult and Ball are going in the early spot with maybe Jackson slipping between them but what about the others 3?

Fox imho is going b4 our spot but maybe, maybe there is a possibility that teams pass over ntilikina cuz he is from europe and over Smith for his bad college performance.

In my opinion if we could get 1 of these 2, Smith especially, it could be the steal of the draft.

"Few things in the NBA are more dismissive than the shrug. The most famous — most enduring — is Jordan's in Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals, but the motion has become an instant Twitter highlight synonymous with a few things:

1. Befuddlement at your own abilities. This is a variation of Shaq staring at his hand as he runs down the floor. This is Boogie discovering he can shoot threes. This is Baby's First 40-Point Game. This is the origin story for a superhero.

2. Disregard for the other team, usually done during a hot shooting streak. It is the equivalent of yelling ""They can't guard me!"" as you jog by your own bench. It's the middle part of a superhero movie before the hero gets beaten into the ground by the main villain and is brimming with confidence. 

3. Confusion about the other team's defense. This differs from 2 in the level of defensive intensity. While Disregard usually comes from high defensive pressure, Confusion comes from a lack of dedicated defense on the shrugger. 

4. Acceptance that whatever you're doing is beyond anyone's control. This happens near the end of the game, and, sticking with superhero movie metaphors, it's when the hero defeats the main villain on some crazy stroke of luck. In this shrug, there's an element of resignation on both sides.  These things just happen, says the fourth shrug.

    In Game 3 of the Warriors-Jazz series, Kevin Durant did a shrug of the second variety. The Jazz had been winning (wow!) and Steph Curry was in ""Briefly Playing Bad to Seem Mortal"" mode, so Kevin Durant decided that enough was enough with the BS, danced on Gordon Hayward like it was Footloose 2, and [just sort of forced the ball to go through the rim on a pull-up fadeaway.](https://streamable.com/aqdvz) It was as unholy as it was disrespectful. 

So where does this shrug rank among the greats? Well, we have to assess a few things about the conditions of the shrug to generate an accurate ranking.

1) One of the primary criteria is setting. Durant pulled up to the sideline, surveyed the crowd, and hit all 1,000 residents of Salt Lake City with the ""where ya team at?"" shrug, as though he wasn't sure if he was playing in the right stadium. It's record-setting levels of disrespect, and Durant was sure to stir some extra Salt into the Lake. On the setting front, Kevin receives full marks, both for location and his interaction with fans. 

2) The second indicator of a great shrug is the game context. Was the shrugger's team losing? Is it high-stakes? Is this game an addition to a heated rivalry? The score Durant receives here is middling. The Warriors were up by 10 after he hit the shot, with under a minute to go in their third straight win against Utah. Utah had really challenged the Warriors, but it was still a three-year powerhouse Golden State team against a Jazz roster with a lot of first-time playoff players. KD had already killed the Jazz, so the shrug was less a salt-in-the-wound move than it was an unnecessary heaping-onto-these-poor-Utah-residents move. He should have done it when [he and Draymond Green got back-to-back buckets to put the Warriors ahead permanently](https://streamable.com/2i853). 

3) Third, how instrumental was the player to his team? A shrug is so much funnier when JR Smith goes 1/9 for 40 minutes of game time but hits his second shot to tie or win the game, but it's more iconic when it's spearheaded by a slew of great plays by the shrugger. Durant scored 16 points in the second half (11 in the fourth quarter) and covered for the inadequacies of Steph and Klay on the offensive end. As such, his shrug ranks moderately highly on the ""instrumental to the win"" ranking. 

**8/10**

Durant's is not the first to follow Jordan's — many have imitated, with varying degrees of success. 

We have Yogi Ferrell's from earlier this season when the once-Brooklyn player was on his first ten-day contract with the Mavericks: www.gifs.com/gif/8qvm2l

Bringing the heat against perennial All-Star Snub Damian Lillard, Yogi hit 9 threes on the way to a tight Mavs win. This shrug falls into the third category, because Yogi is obviously befuddled by the lack of respect he's received from Portland's defense. He got his shrug on early in the game, though, which hurts this score, plus his lack of reputation makes this shrug feel a little unearned. To Yogi's credit, the motion is minimal. He holds it for a beat, and then drops it and gets back to work. Ferrell does earn some points for an unbelievable performance, and for making the Nets look like idiots, which I believe is something that the new CBA requires to happen at least once every fiscal quarter. 

**6/10**

Between Yogi and Kevin Durant sits John Wall, who [tossed up a shrug against the Atlanta Hawks](https://streamable.com/38zc0) in their 2017 playoff series.

John Wall is terrific at all things basketball, especially the parts that involve embarrassing other players. In Game 1, Wall scored 15 points in the third quarter after scoring 13 in the first half, abusing all of the Atlanta defenders assigned to him. Bazemore was helpless. Tim Hardaway Jr. was reminded that he still lived in his dad's shadow. Wall divided Dennis Schroder into East and West Dennis. There was no answer. This shrug sequence is of the fourth variety, and it's perfect, because most of what John Wall does to spite people is perfect, like when he made fun of Schroder on Instagram in one of the best NBA long-con shots of all time.

With the ribbing that the Wizards are prone to, Wall actively flaunting his play was beautifully petty. Every perfect assist, every blow-by layup, and this highly improbable shot in the third was accompanied with Wall waving his arms to pump up the crowd, a smile plastered on his face, so, for context, it scores extremely well. The bounce it took on that pre-shrug shot was amazingly unlikely, and I love that Wall is cognizant of that. For the setting, meh. The D.C. crowd was loud, but there's no real interaction with fans. Wall just holds the shrug as he trots back down the court. As for importance, well, there's no one more important than John Wall to the Wizards. He's their motor, their heart, and their emotional firebrand (a role he shares with Markieff Morris), and he does everything that the team can ask of him. The Wizards are nothing without their star PG. He's earned this shrug, and possibly another one or two before the year is through.

**7/10**

One of my all-time favorites was Derrick Rose's shrug after a [wow-what-how-did-he-do-that shot in 2010](https://streamable.com/mzftn): 

The shot is only part of what makes this shrug so impressive, but it's a crazy shot. You have your run-of-the-mill turnaround jumpers, and then you have this: a falling-out-of-bounds turnaround contested three that swishes through the rim like wind through wheatgrass.1 He's Chicago's star. These are the plays he needs to make.

In addition, you have everything else that plays into the context. This was Rose, the Chicago kid, in his MVP season, in the house that Jordan built, against the even-more-historic Lakers. This was fate, and he handled the moment with remarkable composure. His approach to the shrug is solid too: lands right in front of the Laker bench, turns, faces the crowd, and with a smile that puts this shrug firmly in the first category. This is Rose discovering his heights. It's a beautiful thing.

(I've only seen two threes more impressively lucky than that: Derrick Rose's banked game winner over Tristan Thompson in the 2015 ECSF, and LeBron's banked fallaway three to tie the game against Washington this year. The latter might be the most amazing shot I've ever seen.)

**9/10**

The above shrugs have covered a variety of scores. [MJ's is the gold standard, of course](https://streamable.com/zmupc); it pioneered the movement. It ranks highly in almost every category. The stakes were as high as ever; Jordan, trying to prove his first Finals win was no fluke, was matched up against his predecessor, Clyde Drexler, in a six-game series where two were decided by five points or less. In that first game, Jordan set the tone: 6 threes in the first half (breaking the NBA playoff record). As for context, it was flawless. After nailing that sixth three, Jordan turned, looked at the looked at the broadcast trouble, and shrugged. This shrug is famous because it combined all three shrugs: discovery, confidence, and wonder. MJ was a force to be reckoned with. He scored four points in the second half, but he didn't need any more than that. Chicago won by 33 points; the five other margins of victory only totaled 53 points. In addition, look how Chicago Stadium explodes after his sixth three. Look at the disrespect in Jordan's face as he shakes his head prior to The Shrug. This is poetry in motion; this is human existence; this is the futility of life.

"Obviously, the Bulls are going to make some personnel changes this off-season. Outside of GarPax and The Mayor being fired, who are some players you'd like to see them bring in during the draft and free agency. Niko, from what it sounds like isn't going anywhere. Rondo most likely will be back. DWade would be insane to leave cuz he isn't coming to close to 24 mill for the next year.

During the draft, my top three guys in the 1st round to go after would be Terrance Ferguson, John Collins, or Justin Patton. (Do not even look at Tyler Lydon, Luke Kennard or TJ Leaf). 

Free Agency wise we should be signing guys that make sense for OUR team. Top tier guys like CP3, Blake, Millsap, Lowry aren't coming to Chicago and to be honest that's fine. We are a young team that is going to be developing guys (Denzel, Portis, Zipser, Felicio, Payne, etc.) and bringing in aging stars and veterans to play ahead of these guys is not the best investment for our team or their development. With that being said, I'd love to see them go after a few shooters like JJ Reddick or KCP (even tho he's a restricted FA).  Maybe a few bigs to add some depth to our front court like Amir Johnson or even a guy like Patrick Patterson

Regardless, I think we are doomed for another mediocre season next year unless we push the red button and blow it up aka trade Jimmy to BOS, PHX, or LA. 

What are your guy's thoughts?

Who do you like and who do you hate? (aka the guys GarPax will end up picking up)

See Red baby.","Dream Scenario for the 2017 off-season Obviously, the Bulls are going to make some personnel changes this off-season. Outside of GarPax and The Mayor being fired, who are some players you'd like to see them bring in during the draft and free agency. Niko, from what it sounds like isn't going anywhere. Rondo most likely will be back. DWade would be insane to leave cuz he isn't coming to close to 24 mill for the next year.

During the draft, my top three guys in the 1st round to go after would be Terrance Ferguson, John Collins, or Justin Patton. (Do not even look at Tyler Lydon, Luke Kennard or TJ Leaf). 

Free Agency wise we should be signing guys that make sense for OUR team. Top tier guys like CP3, Blake, Millsap, Lowry aren't coming to Chicago and to be honest that's fine. We are a young team that is going to be developing guys (Denzel, Portis, Zipser, Felicio, Payne, etc.) and bringing in aging stars and veterans to play ahead of these guys is not the best investment for our team or their development. With that being said, I'd love to see them go after a few shooters like JJ Reddick or KCP (even tho he's a restricted FA).  Maybe a few bigs to add some depth to our front court like Amir Johnson or even a guy like Patrick Patterson

Regardless, I think we are doomed for another mediocre season next year unless we push the red button and blow it up aka trade Jimmy to BOS, PHX, or LA.

Hello, I am Brett. I am 24 years old and an accountant. I used to play basketball and I still play city league. But I need something else going on. I would like to set up a NBA 2K17 league completely run outside of the game. I can start a webpage and keep the records and standings update throughout the season. I'm not sure about how long or how many people will join but I'd like to get it started relatively soon. Please let me know if you would be interested. This is on XBOX ONE. I am thinking if we get enough players who are dedicated we should have no problem setting up and playing the games. Give me your gamertag and I will put it together.

"Despite us not being all that good throughout the season, I do believe that we can make some moves to add on some more wins next season. I encourage you all to take this with a grain of salt, as the league is variable and the majority of this discussion revolves around hypotheticals. With that said, here is my argument of how it can be done.

 - Step 1. The Point Guard Problem

As we all know, the PG position has been an issue for a while, and this needs to be the first issue that gets addressed. Realistically, we will be keeping Grant and Canaan, and ridding our roster from the plague that is Michael ""Worse than Tony Snell Somehow I didn't know that was possible"" Carter Williams. I also think that the Bulls are gonna pick up Rondo's option and re-sign him. I admit, I'm not entirely sure how much Cap space we have next season to sign someone. As much as I love Rondo, the better move would be to let him go and pick up one of the many really good shooting point guards that will be available. Mills, Teague, Hill, Collison, and even Holiday are all really good acquisitions that will immediately improve our roster by giving us players that can push the tempo.

- Step 2. Settle on a rotation for the love of all that is good.

I get it Fred. Our team may as well have been selected by a random generator. Still, pick a starting 5 and run with it. Wade is juicing us for 25 mill? Fantastic! Let his old ass knees come off the bench. Shouldn't be basing our rotation on pay. Our starting 5 next season should be:

PG: Rondo or Free Agent acquisition

SG: Jimmy

SF: Zipser

PF: Portis

C: Rolo

Wade can run the second unit. That reminds me...

- Step 3. Niko has to go. 

His contract is such a waste, plus he'll ask for an increase. The guy seems chill, but he's way to inconsistent. 

- Step 4. Development of our defense

This is a huge toss up. Our young guys need to step up and play with more heart. They showed flashes in the first two games of the playoffs. Our defense is abysmal and needs to get better. Unfortunately, lock down defenders are hard to come by. Good news is that defense absolutely can be worked on. 

- Final note.

Obviously, there's an argument that can easily be made of how we can be a 31-51 team next season. Idk. I get that our FO is shit, but I really don't think our team is as bad as people here make it out to be. I agree we are missing a real path. Are we rebuilding, making a run, or what? The answer from Garpax is both somehow. Yeah that makes no sense, but it's what we have to go with. Negativity aside, there's a case to be made that our team is better than 7 teams in the East. As it stands, the Cavs, Celtics, Wizards, Raps, and Bucks are clear ""better"" teams. I'd say that the Heat, Pacers (with a potential to be way worse if they lose George), Hawks, and Hornets are all hovering around our level. Everyone else is worse.

Look forward to the positives. In the end, if you search for negatives you'll find them, if you search for positives you'll find them. 

Cheers!

"So recently whenever I'm bored, I check out some mock drafts and spend like 20-30 minutes looking at guys in our pick ranges. **First things first, I dont know shit, this is just to get people talking**, this is a very quick and rough estimation because I'm super bored.

So a pretty important factor is our specific team's needs. If a player is good enough to where it doesn't matter, sure, fuck it. But still, there are specific needs that we will want to address. Shooting, obviously, a back-up point guard(not many in our range), more reliable forwards/big men, that type of shit. 

Also garpax have actually drafted pretty well in recent years, with the exception of mcdermott, so Im not that worried there.

PICKS: 16, 38

**Terrance Ferguson - SG, Australia**

Definitely one of the bigger risks around this area of the board because of the unpredictability of foreign ball, but I feel like has star potential. Athletic as hell, explosive, looks like he can make plays for himself, which would be huge on our slow, iso ball. Outside shot looks clean, which, obviously we need, and he really looks like he gives a shit on defense. No doubt leads his team, looks charismatic and shit, and isnt scared of other guys(ex. he just straight up swung at this big australian guy). With our tendency to develop foreign guys and his potential, he might be really good with us and fill a SG position we need.

**Justin Patton - C, Creighton**

Huge kid with a ton of intensity and super active down low. He can legit drive as a seven footer and has a semi legit outside shot too. Intensity on the boards is something that everyone except for Rolo just seems to suck at sometimes, and I think he would be a huge help. This dude is super humble and definitely a team leader, like he got an award and just didn't give a shit. A super safe pick IMO and not in a bad way at all.

**Luke Kennard - SG, Duke**

I think this is the guy we are most likely going to take. A super solid, reliable, and consistent shot, with really smart and purposeful fundamentals. Seems very low risk, especially for us, because if we can finally nail down a dependable outside shot, we might be able to legitimately space the floor.

**Jarrett Allen - C, Texas**

I dunno man. Im not sold on this guy. All of his highlights are just him getting lobs on smaller guys and just random other dunks. Hustle only seems to be there when the ball is in the paint on either side. That being said I absolutely do not know shit, and rebounding and paint intensity is something we kinda get fucked on sometimes. Could get a javale mcgee type thing going. Hella lanky

**John Collins - PF, Wake Forest**

Looks to be a super consistent scorer and player at a forward which we NEED(lookin @ u niko) Super active in the post and all that, and defense looks okay from what ive seen? I honstly dont know a ton about this kid but eh.

**Justin Jackson - SF, UNC**

leading player on a super tested team, his shot looks hella consistent and always trying to get up a shot. not too familiar w him

**OG Anunoby, PF - Indiana**

His name is fucking OG. He hustles a shit load, is everywhere, is lanky and long as shit, looks better than most if not all of the other big guys on this list, is super tanky defensively, and his first name is OG. I dont think he'll fall to us tho.

**Isaiah Hartenstein - PF, Zalgiris(Somewhere in europe man idk)**

One of those big guys but also outside shooters. At first I thought he looked okay and he could hustle, rebound, shoot, do all that shit and fit well, but I feel like he overcomplicates things, misses easy shots, doesn't give too much of a shit on defense, and the last thing we need is another guy at the three line.

**Lauri Markannen - PF, Arizona**

I know he won't fall to us, but I looked at him at a time where he mightve. He is a 7 footer at the three line, and can def hit that, but he doesn't use his height to rebound or defend. I just see an andrea bargnani type thing where he scores as a big man and doesn't help anywhere else. Might be a bust, or I might look like an idiot. Either way, we'd need a top 10 pick.

**Caleb Swanigan - PF, Purdue**

my guy. He was hovering around our second rounder range, and I feel like he's sorta moving up, but I see some draymond in this kid. He works a shit ton, something like 5 hours a day I think but I dunno, lost a TON of weight, has improved immensely over the past season, has a great mentality and always hustles. If he ends up going to the spurs or something he is going to be great maybe. Again, I dont know shit. But if he falls to our second rounder, I def think we should try this.

**Jordan Bell - PF, Oregon**

Honestly, all I know about this guy is that he scored a ton in March Madness, led a contender team, and is around our second-pick range. Sounds fine to me tho?

Well theres my shitpost of an analysis. I just wanted to get this sub talking because I feel like this draft could give a directionless team some hope, since free agency won't be too poppin. Discuss if ya want.

PICKS: 16, 38

**Terrance Ferguson - SG, Australia**

Definitely one of the bigger risks around this area of the board because of the unpredictability of foreign ball, but I feel like has star potential. Athletic as hell, explosive, looks like he can make plays for himself, which would be huge on our slow, iso ball. Outside shot looks clean, which, obviously we need, and he really looks like he gives a shit on defense. No doubt leads his team, looks charismatic and shit, and isnt scared of other guys(ex. he just straight up swung at this big australian guy). With our tendency to develop foreign guys and his potential, he might be really good with us and fill a SG position we need.

**Justin Patton - C, Creighton**

Huge kid with a ton of intensity and super active down low. He can legit drive as a seven footer and has a semi legit outside shot too. Intensity on the boards is something that everyone except for Rolo just seems to suck at sometimes, and I think he would be a huge help. This dude is super humble and definitely a team leader, like he got an award and just didn't give a shit. A super safe pick IMO and not in a bad way at all.

**Luke Kennard - SG, Duke**

I think this is the guy we are most likely going to take. A super solid, reliable, and consistent shot, with really smart and purposeful fundamentals. Seems very low risk, especially for us, because if we can finally nail down a dependable outside shot, we might be able to legitimately space the floor.

**Jarrett Allen - C, Texas**

I dunno man. Im not sold on this guy. All of his highlights are just him getting lobs on smaller guys and just random other dunks. Hustle only seems to be there when the ball is in the paint on either side. That being said I absolutely do not know shit, and rebounding and paint intensity is something we kinda get fucked on sometimes. Could get a javale mcgee type thing going. Hella lanky

**John Collins - PF, Wake Forest**

Looks to be a super consistent scorer and player at a forward which we NEED(lookin @ u niko) Super active in the post and all that, and defense looks okay from what ive seen? I honstly dont know a ton about this kid but eh.

**Justin Jackson - SF, UNC**

leading player on a super tested team, his shot looks hella consistent and always trying to get up a shot. not too familiar w him

**OG Anunoby, PF - Indiana**

His name is fucking OG. He hustles a shit load, is everywhere, is lanky and long as shit, looks better than most if not all of the other big guys on this list, is super tanky defensively, and his first name is OG. I dont think he'll fall to us tho.

**Isaiah Hartenstein - PF, Zalgiris(Somewhere in europe man idk)**

One of those big guys but also outside shooters. At first I thought he looked okay and he could hustle, rebound, shoot, do all that shit and fit well, but I feel like he overcomplicates things, misses easy shots, doesn't give too much of a shit on defense, and the last thing we need is another guy at the three line.

**Lauri Markannen - PF, Arizona**

I know he won't fall to us, but I looked at him at a time where he mightve. He is a 7 footer at the three line, and can def hit that, but he doesn't use his height to rebound or defend. I just see an andrea bargnani type thing where he scores as a big man and doesn't help anywhere else. Might be a bust, or I might look like an idiot. Either way, we'd need a top 10 pick.

**Caleb Swanigan - PF, Purdue**

my guy. He was hovering around our second rounder range, and I feel like he's sorta moving up, but I see some draymond in this kid. He works a shit ton, something like 5 hours a day I think but I dunno, lost a TON of weight, has improved immensely over the past season, has a great mentality and always hustles. If he ends up going to the spurs or something he is going to be great maybe. Again, I dont know shit. But if he falls to our second rounder, I def think we should try this.

**Jordan Bell - PF, Oregon**

Honestly, all I know about this guy is that he scored a ton in March Madness, led a contender team, and is around our second-pick range. Sounds fine to me tho?

Well theres my shitpost of an analysis. I just wanted to get this sub talking because I feel like this draft could give a directionless team some hope, since free agency won't be too poppin. Discuss if ya want.

He was widely considered a horrible coach, and rightfully so. Fast forward to 2017 when he is handed James Harden and a plethora of shooters. He will likely win coach od the year and nobody would confuse him with the bum that coached in LA a few years prior (or even NY). Now, to my point. Fred Hoiberg has been a let down. But remember, he runs a system like Dantoni that requires shooters. Unlike Dantoni, he is equipped with none. Rajon Rondo was statistically the best 3pt shooter on the team this last year. I'd like to see what Hoiberg can do when he has even half the tools at his disposal because what he was given was utter trash. Now I'm not saying Hoiberg is as proven as Dantoni, but the comparison to the LAL and NYC days are there.","Remember Mike Dantoni?

"Guys who could go overlooked:

* Ian Clark
* Christian Wood
* Omri Casspi
* Rudy Gay (controversial one but no one likes his game anymore. Maybe we could get him cheap and the Three Alphas could convince him to play off-ball).

Realistic possibles: 

* Robert Covington (had a bad year EDIT: oh shit he's going back to the Sixers), 
* CJ Miles (negativity in Pacers locker room, PG will prob leave), Greg Monroe (Bucks don't really want him), 
* Thabo Sefolosha (being replaced by Tim Hardaway Jr)

Unrealistic possibles: 

* George Hill (everyone wants a 3&D point guard so expensive), 
* JJ Redick (Clippers NEED him back), 
* Patrick Patterson (everyone wants a stretch 4 so expensive) 
* PJ Tucker (found a home w/ Raptors?), 
* Paul Millsap (expensive and Atlanta wants him back), 
* Luc Mbah a Moute (probably not as the Clippers need everybody back),

Former Bulls we should try to get back: 

* Justin Holiday, 
* TAJ
* Sefolosha is former Bull too, thanks /u/hankbaumbach

Conclusion: we should go hard for:

* **Omri Casspi** (young, probably cheap, a Mirotic that can actually shoot who keeps getting cut for some reason),

* **Greg Monroe** (young, people think he can't play defense but he CAN, underrated post scorer who doesn't belong in Milwaukee), 
* **Ian Clark** (young, underrated because he's seen as a product of Warriors success)

Notes: Everybody loves quiet professionals like these guys. They work hard, don't complain, play as a team, play defense, play efficiently.

"I was reading the discussion and post from u/YEAHBULLS (thanks for the post, some interesting points made) and decided to give my counter to it. Just an fyi, this is an idea that I have been advocating for and thinking about a lot so this post is very long, any thoughts would be appreciated.

First let's establish some ground rules. In my mind, in order to have an ideal or ""great contending"" team you should have at least at least a small to decent chance at winning the finals, a good shot at making the finals, and a very favorable shot at making the conference finals. Obviously the goal of every NBA team is to win the finals but you can not control the talent level of every other NBA team or account for poor performances or injury when the playoffs roll around. 


In my mind these are the teams in that fit into these categories(feel free to disagree):

Great Contending Teams:
Warriors, Cavs, Spurs

On the Bubble of being ""Great Contending"" teams:
Rockets, Pre-injury Clippers, Celtics(potentially could be moved down)

On the Bubble of being On the Bubble:
Jazz(maybe should be moved up), current Clippers, Raptors, Wizards

Teams that in 3-5 years could be Great Contending or at least On The Bubble(based on rosters, assets, and general direction, this is more theory):
Bucks, 76ers, Nuggets, Lakers, Suns, Pelicans, Timberwolves

Teams that are doing major overhauls or just beginning a rebuild:
Kings, Nets(will have to wait at least a year)

Team’s I’m completely unsure of what they intend to do but are likely trying to rebuild:
Magic, Knicks

Teams that are meandering and are likely to never reach “Great contending or On the Bubble” and probably not even going to be On the Bubble(In order of promise, imo):
Thunder, Trail Blazers, Grizzlies, Mavericks, Bulls, Hawks, Heat, Pacers, Pistons, Hornets


First of all, I’d like to just point out how this just generally speaks to how loaded the West is right now. Secondly I think this shows how many teams actually have a shot of winning a championship. Only the Cavs, Warriors, and Spurs(less of a chance) this year have a realistic shot at the title. All the On the Bubble teams would require a ton of luck, injuries, and hot streaks to make it to the finals or even win it. This has been accurate for almost every year the NBA has been since the 1980s. In order to win a championship or make the finals you need either

1. A top 5 player(or a true superstar) and a good secondary star plus quality players or another fringe-star or star(Super Teams and almost Superteams)


Showtime Lakers(Kareem, Magic, Worthy), 83-84 Sixers(Moses Malone and Dr.J), Bad Boy Pistons(Isaiah and Dumars(arguable)), 80s Celtics(Bird, Mchale, Parish), JORDANS BULLS( U ALREADY KNOW!), Jazz(Stockton and Malone), Spurs(Duncan and Robinson), Lakers(Shaq and Kobe), Nets(Kidd and Carter(arguable)), Spurs(Duncan and Parker/Ginobili), Celtics(KG, Pierce, Allen), Lakers(Kobe and Pau), Heat(Lebron, Wade, Bosh), Thunder(KD and Russ), Warriors(Curry, Klay, Draymond)


2. Teams with One True Superstar(top 5 player) and a bunch of surrounding players fit to needs

Moses’s Rockets, Hakeem’s Rockets, Shaq’s Magic, Barkley’s Suns, AI’s sixers(terrible cast), Young Lebron’s Cavs(terrible cast) Dirk’s Mavs, Dwight’s Magic, 


3. Teams with a near superstar and very good cast:
Blazers(Drexler), Sonics(Payton and Kemp(could be put in column 1)), Knicks(Ewing), Pacers(Reggie(possibly one of the worst finals teams), 04 pistons(Ben Wallace plus amazing cast of players)

Some of these rankings might be inaccurate or arguable but I would consider most of them to be spot on. Feel free to discuss in the comments.


I thought we were talking about trading Jimmy Butler, why does any of this matter? 

It shows that generally any team that makes the finals either needs to have a true superstar(generational player/ top 5 player) with a secondary star, a true superstar and a roster designed to fit his needs, or at least a near superstar with a great cast.
It shows that every team that wins a championship falls into the 1st category(except for Dirk’s Mavs and Hakeem's Rockets who had superstars that went nuts in the playoffs with a team built around their needs, and the 04 Pistons who had a fringe superstar and a bunch of fringe all stars).
Teams that fall into the 2nd and 3rd category rarely win and when they do it’s often because of weird circumstances(Jordan leaving and Lebron playing terrible).

If the rankings of today’s teams are any indicator, successful teams are even more star-oriented. The Warriors will be a top-2 team for at least the next 4-5 years and have 2 superstars and 2 surrounding stars surrounding them, The Cavs have 1 superstar and 2 surrounding stars and will likely continue to dominate the East for at least 3-4 years. The Spurs have potentially the 2nd best player in the league and an amazing cast with great chemistry with legendary coaching and player evaluation.
The on the bubble teams also fit these final teams models: The Rockets have a bonafide superstar and a perfect cast and coach to surround him and will continue on this path for at least the next 3 years, the Clippers when healthy have Cp3, Blake and DJ and could be a dark horse next year but are likely falling off. And the Celtics have Isaah and Horford but are mainly reliant on Brown and the next 2 years top picks paying off. If even one of them become an all-star or they land Heyward this summer, they will likely stay dangerous for at least the next 2-3 years(assuming Isaiah is resigned).


All Major On the Rise teams look even scarier in 3 years:
	Sixers(Embiid, Simmons, this year’s 1st, and Saric and lot’s of young depth), Pelicans(Boogie, AD, and ??), Wolves(KAT, Wiggins, Lavine and maybe Isaac!), Suns(Booker, Chris, Bender, and this years pick, and Bledsoe), Bucks(Giannis, Middleton, Thon, Jabari) Nuggets(Jokic, Harris and a dearth of young players), Lakers(D’lo, Ingram, Randle)



Maybe only 2 of these teams will pan out into a contending team but odds are no matter what there will likely be multiple star teams in the next 3-4 years even without free agency.


All this clearly points to every contending team in the next 5 years likely being a superteam, or having either multiple stars or one generational superstar with a good cast. The talent level in the nba of teams is not going to go down. Even in the East if the Cavs decline in 4 years, the Sixers(if healthy) and Bucks will be eagerly taking its place with at least with at least one superstar(Embiid and Giannis) and secondary stars(Simmons!! and Jibari?) with a lot of other talent. This isn’t even mentioning that the Celtics will likely draft top-2 this year or next year and grab Lonzo, Fultz, Jackson, Porter, Ayton, or Donic to add to their core. Seriously, even though Fuck the Celtics, they could theoretically roll out a Fultz-Bradley-Brown-Horford-Ayton lineup or something like(assuming no picks go great): Isaiah-top 5 pick/Bradley-Brown-Josh Jackson-Horford.


Ok, so the talent in the East won’t likely go down until Lebron declines(probably 3-4 years, right when Kyrie is in his prime), and even if it does, multiple top teams could almost match the Cavs or make the East even harder collectively. But who cares? Butler is 27 and we need to win with him before he gets old, let’s go all in while we can and then consider a rebuild. Why this fundamentally can’t happen:


1. Butler is not a superstar. He is probably the 8th-9th best player in the league, but he still isn’t at the level of Lebron, KD, Curry, Harden, Kawhi, Russ, AD or CP3. 


2. Even if he was a true superstar, his supporting cast is abysmal and there are few ways to upgrade it. Our young guys(Valentine, Portis, Felicio, Zipser) look to amount to nothing more than good role players at best and still need more years to progress. Our draft picks look to be perennially outside the lottery and while they could provide value, those picks often end up just becoming solid role players. Rondo has payed off in the playoffs but likely won’t return a ton of value, RoLo is solid but also doesn’t have a ton of trade value, Wade on his current contract won’t return much at all if he resigns. So very few big trades could we pull off to have a major impact on this team, and I also don’t trust GarPax to make a net positive trade, don’t bank on any trades changing this team.


3. Assuming we keep Rondo(what this sub seems to want), If Wade resigns(very likely), we will only have 17 million in Cap Space. We also have to pay Felicio so drop that to at least 13 million. This isn’t even mentioning that Niko will likely walk and we will need to sign a power forward who may cost more. With that money: Curry and Durant(lol), Griffin, Hayward, Paul, Lowry, Millsap, Holiday, Hill, and likely not Danilo won’t sign here. Also Porter, KCP, and Noel are getting a max or will be matched.


4. Even if Wade is unrestricted, Curry and Durant(lol), Griffin, Hayward, Paul, Lowry, all have no reason to sign here with Serge, Millsap, Jrue, Hill, Teague, and Danilo only have a very small chance and they would demand a max or near-max, hamstringing our cap while aging. Every other big free agent is either a vet on a contending team or would only serve as a role player and have minimal impact. Only Millsap,Serge, and Danilo would likely make the team better after Wade leaving(which he likely won’t do) and not by a huge margin. The pgs would occupy rondo’s position so likely a no-no. Absolutely Best Case,  is this Bulls team even making it to the conference finals?? Again extremely  unlikely this happens but:
	Rondo-Valentine-Butler-Millsap/Serge(max)-Rolo(Grant-our pick-Zipser-Mirotic/FA Backup-Felicio). This team would be about 5-10 million away from the cap and again I’d like to emphasise there is a very small chance Millsap, Serge, or Danilo would want to sign here, and wed have to overpay Serge or Danilo. 


       5. This is the team we will likely be trotting out next season if we make any signings, something very similar to last team:
Rondo-Wade-Butler-Amir Johnson-Rolo(Valentine/Grant-JJ Reddick/Roberson/Valentine-Zipser-Mirotic-Felicio-our pick)
We could likely only sign one of Reddick or Amir if we resign Felicio	and again there's only a small chance either would come here. That team probably makes 6th-7th seed at best, and 9th-8th likely again.


6. I won’t do a full analysis of 2018 FAs but it’s more of the same, superstars who won’t come here, restricted FAs unavailable, and mid-level players likely being the targets. Even if we have cap space we’re not that desirable of a team with our roster and our management and our history of striking out on big free agents.


7. MOST IMPORTANTLY, Butler’s a free agent in 2019, this gives us a two year window to convince him to stay. I know he loves this city and team but it’s not unrealistic to see him likely looking at greener pastures or a contending team. Also something to consider is GarPax will not want to lose Butler for nothing and don’t have the most faith in him, they could feel forced to trade him in 2018 or 2019 before the deadline if they feel he won't resign, likely at a reduced value.


So to recap, why trade Butler? This team has a very small chance of getting better significantly in the next two years and will likely never approach the level needed for a team to make the finals or ECFs in the next two years before his contract runs up. His supporting cast’s key players are not young and are not that talented meaning we are way more than one good player away from being a great contending team, on the bubble, or even likely on the bubble of on the bubble. We don’t have the appropriate assets or talent level(and potentially cap space this summer) to attract a marquee free agent. This team can simply not ever reach the level of a contending team or almost any finals team ever, I think it is unrealistic for Bulls fan to say we just have to retool around Butler to compete. Unless you classify competing as having not even a prayer’s chance of making the finals and a small chance at ECFs, we will not be able to compete. His value will decline in the next year as his contract grows shorter and his value will likely never be higher than it is right now. 


Trading him soon would likely bear a top-4 pick this year and potentially a top-4 pick next year/ promising prospects(something like 2017 nets, 2018 nets, amir/zeller, and rozier for contracts). I would prefer a package centered around a 2018 top-5 first and a 2019/2017 first but that’s just me. Trading Jimmy might cause Wade to leave and would make us one of the worst teams in the league for the next two to three years. We could likely walk away from the trade(counting our assets) in 2019 with a roster of 2017 top-3 pick(lonzo or jackson), 2017-16 pick(Bam Adebyo?), Our 2018 top 4 pick(Bamba, Porter, Donic, Ayton), 2018 nets top-7 pick, Our 2019 top-7 pick, potential midlevel picks and promising prospects. and about 50 mil in cap space that we could use to acquire bad contracts for picks or go after and overpay younger free agents. One of the common comments I always see is why trade Butler for someone who only has a chance as being as good as Butler. Well first of all, Lonzo, Fultz, Donic, Porter, Ayton and Bamba all look like they have the potential to be better than butler and I’d bet on Fultz, Porter, and maybe Ayton being better or a top ten player. Also we can keep them for 8 years and for 4 of them they will be on rookie contracts. Maybe some picks pan out, maybe some don’t. But at least trading Butler gives us a shot at a superstar or 2, while still keeping us cheap and flexible. Butler’s return will yield at least a high pick, another high pick/a jaylen brown type and make our own pick for the next 3 years likely top 5 and extremely valuable. 



No Butler constructed team in the near future has a chance at making the finals and likely not the ECFs. If we keep being hellbent on not trading him he may just walk on the Bulls like Aldridge, Durant, Lebron, and many others have. If he does walk we’ll just end up hitting the reset button 2 years later with no assets in return for Butler, an outcome very possible if you intend to not trade him. And even if he doesn’t walk, the current roster around him can not bring him to that level before he hits 32 or 33. Yes the draft is a crapshoot and yes trading a superstar can be risky. But all of NBA history points to it being nearly impossible for Butler(not a superstar but still amazing) to lead a team of this bad quality with a terrible FO(fuck GarPax) to the finals. And if it is preferable to “compete” and not have a shot at ever making it to the finals and likely not the ECFS, that's fine. But I have a feeling this isn't the end goal of most Bulls Fans and it is completely unrealistic to expect this team to actually contend or ever reach the finals in the next two years before Jimmy's contract ends and likely not even after that. I would prefer a chance at a restart and the chance of drafting a generational talent or multiple stars and being able to have a chance at really competing, and the only way that seems possible with this roster is blow this team up, starting with Butler.

1. A top 5 player(or a true superstar) and a good secondary star plus quality players or another fringe-star or star(Super Teams and almost Superteams)


Showtime Lakers(Kareem, Magic, Worthy), 83-84 Sixers(Moses Malone and Dr.J), Bad Boy Pistons(Isaiah and Dumars(arguable)), 80s Celtics(Bird, Mchale, Parish), JORDANS BULLS( U ALREADY KNOW!), Jazz(Stockton and Malone), Spurs(Duncan and Robinson), Lakers(Shaq and Kobe), Nets(Kidd and Carter(arguable)), Spurs(Duncan and Parker/Ginobili), Celtics(KG, Pierce, Allen), Lakers(Kobe and Pau), Heat(Lebron, Wade, Bosh), Thunder(KD and Russ), Warriors(Curry, Klay, Draymond)


2. Teams with One True Superstar(top 5 player) and a bunch of surrounding players fit to needs

Moses’s Rockets, Hakeem’s Rockets, Shaq’s Magic, Barkley’s Suns, AI’s sixers(terrible cast), Young Lebron’s Cavs(terrible cast) Dirk’s Mavs, Dwight’s Magic, 


3. Teams with a near superstar and very good cast:
Blazers(Drexler), Sonics(Payton and Kemp(could be put in column 1)), Knicks(Ewing), Pacers(Reggie(possibly one of the worst finals teams), 04 pistons(Ben Wallace plus amazing cast of players)

Some of these rankings might be inaccurate or arguable but I would consider most of them to be spot on. Feel free to discuss in the comments.


I thought we were talking about trading Jimmy Butler, why does any of this matter? 

It shows that generally any team that makes the finals either needs to have a true superstar(generational player/ top 5 player) with a secondary star, a true superstar and a roster designed to fit his needs, or at least a near superstar with a great cast.
It shows that every team that wins a championship falls into the 1st category(except for Dirk’s Mavs and Hakeem's Rockets who had superstars that went nuts in the playoffs with a team built around their needs, and the 04 Pistons who had a fringe superstar and a bunch of fringe all stars).
Teams that fall into the 2nd and 3rd category rarely win and when they do it’s often because of weird circumstances(Jordan leaving and Lebron playing terrible).

If the rankings of today’s teams are any indicator, successful teams are even more star-oriented. The Warriors will be a top-2 team for at least the next 4-5 years and have 2 superstars and 2 surrounding stars surrounding them, The Cavs have 1 superstar and 2 surrounding stars and will likely continue to dominate the East for at least 3-4 years. The Spurs have potentially the 2nd best player in the league and an amazing cast with great chemistry with legendary coaching and player evaluation.
The on the bubble teams also fit these final teams models: The Rockets have a bonafide superstar and a perfect cast and coach to surround him and will continue on this path for at least the next 3 years, the Clippers when healthy have Cp3, Blake and DJ and could be a dark horse next year but are likely falling off. And the Celtics have Isaah and Horford but are mainly reliant on Brown and the next 2 years top picks paying off. If even one of them become an all-star or they land Heyward this summer, they will likely stay dangerous for at least the next 2-3 years(assuming Isaiah is resigned).


All Major On the Rise teams look even scarier in 3 years:
	Sixers(Embiid, Simmons, this year’s 1st, and Saric and lot’s of young depth), Pelicans(Boogie, AD, and ??), Wolves(KAT, Wiggins, Lavine and maybe Isaac!), Suns(Booker, Chris, Bender, and this years pick, and Bledsoe), Bucks(Giannis, Middleton, Thon, Jabari) Nuggets(Jokic, Harris and a dearth of young players), Lakers(D’lo, Ingram, Randle)



Maybe only 2 of these teams will pan out into a contending team but odds are no matter what there will likely be multiple star teams in the next 3-4 years even without free agency.


All this clearly points to every contending team in the next 5 years likely being a superteam, or having either multiple stars or one generational superstar with a good cast. The talent level in the nba of teams is not going to go down. Even in the East if the Cavs decline in 4 years, the Sixers(if healthy) and Bucks will be eagerly taking its place with at least with at least one superstar(Embiid and Giannis) and secondary stars(Simmons!! and Jibari?) with a lot of other talent. This isn’t even mentioning that the Celtics will likely draft top-2 this year or next year and grab Lonzo, Fultz, Jackson, Porter, Ayton, or Donic to add to their core. Seriously, even though Fuck the Celtics, they could theoretically roll out a Fultz-Bradley-Brown-Horford-Ayton lineup or something like(assuming no picks go great): Isaiah-top 5 pick/Bradley-Brown-Josh Jackson-Horford.


Ok, so the talent in the East won’t likely go down until Lebron declines(probably 3-4 years, right when Kyrie is in his prime), and even if it does, multiple top teams could almost match the Cavs or make the East even harder collectively. But who cares? Butler is 27 and we need to win with him before he gets old, let’s go all in while we can and then consider a rebuild. Why this fundamentally can’t happen:


1. Butler is not a superstar. He is probably the 8th-9th best player in the league, but he still isn’t at the level of Lebron, KD, Curry, Harden, Kawhi, Russ, AD or CP3. 


2. Even if he was a true superstar, his supporting cast is abysmal and there are few ways to upgrade it. Our young guys(Valentine, Portis, Felicio, Zipser) look to amount to nothing more than good role players at best and still need more years to progress. Our draft picks look to be perennially outside the lottery and while they could provide value, those picks often end up just becoming solid role players. Rondo has payed off in the playoffs but likely won’t return a ton of value, RoLo is solid but also doesn’t have a ton of trade value, Wade on his current contract won’t return much at all if he resigns. So very few big trades could we pull off to have a major impact on this team, and I also don’t trust GarPax to make a net positive trade, don’t bank on any trades changing this team.


3. Assuming we keep Rondo(what this sub seems to want), If Wade resigns(very likely), we will only have 17 million in Cap Space. We also have to pay Felicio so drop that to at least 13 million. This isn’t even mentioning that Niko will likely walk and we will need to sign a power forward who may cost more. With that money: Curry and Durant(lol), Griffin, Hayward, Paul, Lowry, Millsap, Holiday, Hill, and likely not Danilo won’t sign here. Also Porter, KCP, and Noel are getting a max or will be matched.


4. Even if Wade is unrestricted, Curry and Durant(lol), Griffin, Hayward, Paul, Lowry, all have no reason to sign here with Serge, Millsap, Jrue, Hill, Teague, and Danilo only have a very small chance and they would demand a max or near-max, hamstringing our cap while aging. Every other big free agent is either a vet on a contending team or would only serve as a role player and have minimal impact. Only Millsap,Serge, and Danilo would likely make the team better after Wade leaving(which he likely won’t do) and not by a huge margin. The pgs would occupy rondo’s position so likely a no-no. Absolutely Best Case,  is this Bulls team even making it to the conference finals?? Again extremely  unlikely this happens but:
	Rondo-Valentine-Butler-Millsap/Serge(max)-Rolo(Grant-our pick-Zipser-Mirotic/FA Backup-Felicio). This team would be about 5-10 million away from the cap and again I’d like to emphasise there is a very small chance Millsap, Serge, or Danilo would want to sign here, and wed have to overpay Serge or Danilo. 


       5. This is the team we will likely be trotting out next season if we make any signings, something very similar to last team:
Rondo-Wade-Butler-Amir Johnson-Rolo(Valentine/Grant-JJ Reddick/Roberson/Valentine-Zipser-Mirotic-Felicio-our pick)
We could likely only sign one of Reddick or Amir if we resign Felicio	and again there's only a small chance either would come here. That team probably makes 6th-7th seed at best, and 9th-8th likely again.


6. I won’t do a full analysis of 2018 FAs but it’s more of the same, superstars who won’t come here, restricted FAs unavailable, and mid-level players likely being the targets. Even if we have cap space we’re not that desirable of a team with our roster and our management and our history of striking out on big free agents.


7. MOST IMPORTANTLY, Butler’s a free agent in 2019, this gives us a two year window to convince him to stay. I know he loves this city and team but it’s not unrealistic to see him likely looking at greener pastures or a contending team. Also something to consider is GarPax will not want to lose Butler for nothing and don’t have the most faith in him, they could feel forced to trade him in 2018 or 2019 before the deadline if they feel he won't resign, likely at a reduced value.


So to recap, why trade Butler? This team has a very small chance of getting better significantly in the next two years and will likely never approach the level needed for a team to make the finals or ECFs in the next two years before his contract runs up. His supporting cast’s key players are not young and are not that talented meaning we are way more than one good player away from being a great contending team, on the bubble, or even likely on the bubble of on the bubble. We don’t have the appropriate assets or talent level(and potentially cap space this summer) to attract a marquee free agent. This team can simply not ever reach the level of a contending team or almost any finals team ever, I think it is unrealistic for Bulls fan to say we just have to retool around Butler to compete. Unless you classify competing as having not even a prayer’s chance of making the finals and a small chance at ECFs, we will not be able to compete. His value will decline in the next year as his contract grows shorter and his value will likely never be higher than it is right now. 


Trading him soon would likely bear a top-4 pick this year and potentially a top-4 pick next year/ promising prospects(something like 2017 nets, 2018 nets, amir/zeller, and rozier for contracts). I would prefer a package centered around a 2018 top-5 first and a 2019/2017 first but that’s just me. Trading Jimmy might cause Wade to leave and would make us one of the worst teams in the league for the next two to three years. We could likely walk away from the trade(counting our assets) in 2019 with a roster of 2017 top-3 pick(lonzo or jackson), 2017-16 pick(Bam Adebyo?), Our 2018 top 4 pick(Bamba, Porter, Donic, Ayton), 2018 nets top-7 pick, Our 2019 top-7 pick, potential midlevel picks and promising prospects. and about 50 mil in cap space that we could use to acquire bad contracts for picks or go after and overpay younger free agents. One of the common comments I always see is why trade Butler for someone who only has a chance as being as good as Butler. Well first of all, Lonzo, Fultz, Donic, Porter, Ayton and Bamba all look like they have the potential to be better than butler and I’d bet on Fultz, Porter, and maybe Ayton being better or a top ten player. Also we can keep them for 8 years and for 4 of them they will be on rookie contracts. Maybe some picks pan out, maybe some don’t. But at least trading Butler gives us a shot at a superstar or 2, while still keeping us cheap and flexible. Butler’s return will yield at least a high pick, another high pick/a jaylen brown type and make our own pick for the next 3 years likely top 5 and extremely valuable. 



No Butler constructed team in the near future has a chance at making the finals and likely not the ECFs. If we keep being hellbent on not trading him he may just walk on the Bulls like Aldridge, Durant, Lebron, and many others have. If he does walk we’ll just end up hitting the reset button 2 years later with no assets in return for Butler, an outcome very possible if you intend to not trade him. And even if he doesn’t walk, the current roster around him can not bring him to that level before he hits 32 or 33. Yes the draft is a crapshoot and yes trading a superstar can be risky. But all of NBA history points to it being nearly impossible for Butler(not a superstar but still amazing) to lead a team of this bad quality with a terrible FO(fuck GarPax) to the finals. And if it is preferable to “compete” and not have a shot at ever making it to the finals and likely not the ECFS, that's fine. But I have a feeling this isn't the end goal of most Bulls Fans and it is completely unrealistic to expect this team to actually contend or ever reach the finals in the next two years before Jimmy's contract ends and likely not even after that. I would prefer a chance at a restart and the chance of drafting a generational talent or multiple stars and being able to have a chance at really competing, and the only way that seems possible with this roster is blow this team up, starting with Butler.

"I understand your frustration, feeling we need to rebuild, etc. But can you think of any recent situations where a team traded away a big name all-star and came out the better for it?


(Boston) w/Garnett and Pierce - doesn't count since they were already washed up 

(Sacramento) Cousins - Kings lost this IMO

(Minnesota) Kevin Love - debatable. Wiggins has showed signs but it's not clear he will be all star level 

(Orlando) Dwight Howard - Orlando got massacred in this one without question

(New Orleans) Chris Paul - New Orleans lost this one. Their best haul from this was Eric Gordon. They drafted Austin Rivers with the pick they got in this trade.

(Denver) Carmelo Anthony - the Nuggets got better for a short period of time but never became serious playoff competitors

(Memphis) Pau Gasol - this actually worked out for the Grizzlies, getting Marc Gasol, albeit with some luck since no one knew Marc would turn out so good

(Philadelphia) Allen Iverson - although AI declined after going to Denver, think it's fair to say the Sixers didn't get better from trading him.

(Orlando) Tracy McGrady - Tmac had a couple good years in Houston. Steve Francis was gone from Orlando by the following year. Clear L for the Magic.

Can anyone think of any examples I'm missing here?

So IMO we need to exercise caution when we say we should just blow it all up and trade Jimmy. It seems like more often than not, teams that trade away a big all-star piece end up getting fleeced.

Long story, but I figured I should tell it...

My buddy is a season ticket holder, and when playoff tickets opened up he bought a bunch. Originally we were going to sit in row AA (second row), but then a couple baseline courtside seats were listed, and when the price dropped to $1000 we decided to YOLO.

Chuck Garfien told me before the game that they're Reggie Rose's old seats, and we're only a couple seats down from the seats my buddy sold. Turns out the guys who bought them for double face are Wyc Grousbeck (Celtics owner) and Danny Ainge.

We started the night with [some goofy shit we bought on aliexpress](http://imgur.com/C9eZ1Zh), but we were [packing some heat underneath](http://imgur.com/FbwCkao). We agreed before the game that we would keep them covered unless the Bulls were losing.

We were pretty obnoxious all game (shout out to my girl Poksun for over-serving us), yelling at Celtics players constantly, but we kept it pretty civil and weren't swearing. I kept telling Marcus Smart to ""show me how you write a check for 25 grand with one finger,"" asking Horford how it feels to be horribly overpaid, telling Kelly Olynyk to fix his hair, etc. Nothing crazy.

Some time in the 3rd quarter I yelled something about 25-grand to Smart, adding something stupid and unoriginal about his girlfriend (don't remember what exactly I said). Wyc turns to me and says ""Hey, no girlfriend stuff. I could have you tossed. Just no girlfriend stuff."" Security guy over my shoulder tells me to stop talking to the players. OK, that's fine. I apologize to Wyc. He makes fun of my hair (I was making fun of Gerald Green's Coolio hair earlier, so Wyc was giving it back). A few minutes after this Smart actually asked Wyc/Ainge to throw us out, but they were cool and didn't oblige. Aside from one comment we weren't saying or doing anything offensive or inappropriate.

Start of the 4th, Bulls down about 70 at this point, it was time. We take off our sweatshirts and sit back. (At this point we're not yelling anything at anyone.) About 5-10 minutes later a security guard approaches us and says something along the lines of ""You guys should put the sweatshirts back on. They're going to kick you out."" He tries to say this as if he's doing us a favor, not threatening us. Yeah, OK buddy. We wait another minute or so and throw the sweatshirts back on. Lots of basketball left to play, and we can always get kicked out later.

With a minute left in the game my buddy takes his sweatshirt off again. Immediately security comes up to us, telling him repeatedly to cover it up. He pushes back, telling them he's a season ticket holder, etc. They then threatened to take our pictures so we'd be banned for life from the UC--just for wearing the t-shirt.

Game ends, Wyc comes over and shakes our hands, and security escorts us up the staircase to the concourse (they didn't remove us from the building). I don't think they actually took our pictures, but there's undoubtedly tons of security footage if they really want to ban us for life (and I just posted our pic above, so come at me bro).

" That big play on the top of /r/nba that made him look dumb? mostly Canaans fault. Canaan took wade assignment, then doesn't let him know, and wade(yes he has some blame, he could have realized quicker) was slow to rotate to cover olynyk, since wade was too late(hustling to olynyk would put him in worse position to catch olynyks rebounds falling short) he just waited for the short rebound.  


Now, Canaan was supposed to be guarding bradley- he took the matchup afterall, however, canaan's dumb ass didn't bother to box bradley out(or even guard him after olynyk shot). 


 Could wade have been a little more alert and have stopped bradley? Yeah, he could have, but the defensive breakdown wasn't on him in the first place.
  
Wade's 35 years old and his name isn't Michael Jordan or Lebron, He can't bail this team out on every fucked up defensive set/breakdown.

 He makes jimmy look bad(Seriously, wade is shooting a shit ton higher EFG %, slightly higher fg%, and over twice Jimmy's 3%)



here's the kicker though; Wades's defensive box +/- is higher than our young star player Jimmy.....


Wades PER is 18, Jimmy's is 18.8, A PER of 18 is exceptional for a 35 year old, especially one that plays like wade has/had.

Wade is shooting the same TS% as Jimmy(because of freethrows lmao).

Let's all bitch at wade though, Damn 35 year superstar old isn't carrying our team while Jimmy dissapears... Kinda reminds me of wade and bron in 2010- 2011(their first year together, except lebron was at least playing somewhat well)

Wades PER is 18, Jimmy's is 18.8, A PER of 18 is exceptional for a 35 year old, especially one that plays like wade has/had.

Wade is shooting the same TS% as Jimmy(because of freethrows lmao).

Let's all bitch at wade though, Damn 35 year superstar old isn't carrying our team while Jimmy dissapears... Kinda reminds me of wade and bron in 2010- 2011(their first year together, except lebron was at least playing somewhat well)

The Thomas Rules

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The Thomas Rules were a defensive basketball strategy employed by the Chicago Bulls against Isaiah Thomas in order to enhance his effectiveness on offense. Devised by Cameron Payne in 2017, the Bulls' strategy was ""to play him soft, to be tender, and to not play its defenses so as to try to throw him off balance.""[1] Sometimes the Bulls would underplay Thomas to get the ball to him. Sometimes they would clap their hands in his face as he shot, more often they would do nothing, smile, tie each others' shoes, or shout, ""Nice shot! Wet!"" And whenever he went to the basket, they made sure their center was as far from the rim as possible. This strategy has never been employed against other prolific scoring guards.[2] 

The Thomas Rules were an instrumental aspect of the friendship between the analytics era Celtics and GarPaxDorfHoibergo's Chicago Bulls in the late 2010s and early 2050s. This style of defense enhanced players including Thomas from scoring and was carried out by Anthony Morrow and Joffrey Lavergne.

In an interview with TheAthletic, then Bulls coach ~~Tim Floyd~~ Fred Hoiberg described the Thomas Rules as:[3]

""If Thomas was at the point, we stared him down and reminisced fondly of our excellent practice sessions. If he was on the left wing, our minds wandered to that clip of Varsity Blues we just watched in the lockerroom. If he was on the right wing, we'd yell ""Carry!"", and discontinue our defense to force the refs to blow the whistle. He could hurt you equally from either wing—hell, he could hurt you from the hot-dog stand—but we just wanted to vary the look. And if he was in the corner, we'd try to trip him from the sideline.

The other rule was, any time he went by you, you had to blow in his ear. If he was coming off a screen, blow in there. We didn't want to be dirty—I know some people thought we were—but we had to do something and that's what I came up with. I'm not very good at this, am I?""","The Thomas Rules [OC] Copypasted the wikipedia entry for the Jordan Rules and find-replaced Jordan with Thomas.

"Hello Bulls fans, Are you in need of a new hobby? Have you always wondered how you would fair if you were in a front office position? Worry not, For /r/NBALiveMockDraft is looking to recruit members to fill some spots for the Chicago Bulls!

Here is a quick breakdown of all the roles: Owner: Sets the direction and vision of the franchise overall. You're in charge of delegating tasks to the rest of the front office and making sure your goals are met. GM: Mainly in charge of trades and signing free agents. Free agency is an interesting process so a GM is very helpful and a necessity. Coach: Sets the rotations and lineups for each game. These are general concepts, but most FOs help one another out on everything.

For the Bulls the current positions available are GM and coach.

DM me if you're interested in learning more/ want to join. There is an interview process to make sure you are: active, legit, intelligent, likable. Cheers!

If you DM me make sure you put what team as we are recruiting for multiple teams. Thanks!","Come join the Bulls' FO in a NBA 2k Simulation League Hello Bulls fans, Are you in need of a new hobby?

"I was going to reply to the post asking whether we should sign Nate Robinson or not, but I figure I would elaborate and get some other opinions as well. I would be fine with signing Nate in the offseason as our bench PG, Keep Rondo as well. Nate has been working his butt off trying to get signed and I think he would be a decent backup. Use him like Celts use Thomas in the high pick and roll. But no I don't think signing him solves any long term problems.

Jerian I think just isn't ready in any way shape or form whether or not he gets the starting position or the backup spot. He isn't aggressive enough despite him being more of a scoring oriented guard, and he isn't a good distributor either. The only good player we got from that Rose trade was Lopez.

As much as I'm a fan of Wade, he doesn't belong on the roster either, because Butler works better at the SG position IMO. Unless he opts out, takes a pay cut to come off the bench so it gives the Bulls a better chance to sign someone else to a Max in the offseason. Him, along with Rondo and Butler on the floor just isn't a good fit, despite how well the team did the first two games in the playoffs. The team just runs better when Wade isn't on the floor with both of the other guys on.

We need another small forward if Zipser is our current main option. Obviously Gordon Hayward would be the guy we need to go after in the offseason, but in all likely cases, he'll resign with the Jazz, but that may also depend on how far his team gets into the playoffs. I think he would have an easier workload being in the eastern conference considering how strong the top western teams are. If we had a starting lineup of Rondo, Butler, Hayward, Portis, and Lopez I think that would be phenomenal. Portis has been getting better as the season progressed, and has been picking his spots in the playoffs. 

We also need to get rid of Mirotic seeing how inconsistent he is. It's been 4 games into these playoffs and these are his stat lines:

* Game 1: 4 points, 4 rebounds, **1/9 FG made** in 19 minutes. **0/5 from 3P**
* Game 2: 13 points, 7 rebounds, 2 assists, 2 blks, **5/13 FG made** in 28 minutes. **3/9 from 3P**
* Game 3: 11 points, 6 rebounds, 3 assists, 3/7 FG made in 26 minutes. 2/4 from 3P
* Game 4: 13 points, 7 rebounds, **4/11 FG made in 34 minutes.**  **2/8 from 3P**

Despite him being a so-called stretch 4 he's only made **7 of his 26 three-point attempts**. That's 26.9% through 4 playoff games. He's only cracked 30+ minutes played in a game once so far, and shot 25% from outside in 8 shots. His defense still isn't that good either. He pump fakes too often still and thinks he's fouled on every drive to the basket he does. He missed 3 attempts near the basket that I saw in game 4 that I watched and complained for a foul every time while putting up a half-assed shot attempt. In game 3 he was posting up Thomas and lost the ball, and tried to complain for a foul. **Did you get that? Nikola Mirotic, 6'10"" 258 lbs, lost a post up battle to Isaiah Thomas! Who is 5'9"" 185lbs.** I'm sick of Mirotic at this point.

If we lose Rondo, I think we should go after Jrue Holiday. But again, he may sign with the Pelicans because A: they have Anthony Davis, B: they have Demarcus Cousins, and C: because they can pay him the most. But the Bulls I think have a much better chance in the playoffs than the Pelicans at this point. I've already said we should go after Hayward. As for the draft, I have no idea who to get seeing as all of the good point guards will be gone. Maybe another PF to replace Mirotic? I do not want the Bulls to give Mirotic any money this offseason.

But that's my take-away opinion after watching these 4 playoff games. I still think we have a shot of getting to the second round, but it's going to take more spectacular play from Butler, above average play from Wade, and Lopez needs to see playing time in the 4th quarter. And if Rondo could come back earlier than expected that would also greatly help our chances. BUT, if the Bulls lose first round then we have a lot of things we have to accomplish this offseason. Firing Fred Hoiberg might also help too.","My thoughts on how the Bulls should move forward (game 4 reaction) I was going to reply to the post asking whether we should sign Nate Robinson or not, but I figure I would elaborate and get some other opinions as well.

"I've seen a lot of panic on this sub, and all over /r/nba from Bulls fans. Now one could say that a big part of it is the loss of Rondo more than the loss of Game 3. 

But remember this, we beat a hell of a lot of good teams without Rondo this year, and we had quite a few good win periods without him starting too. (Think January, when we had the comeback over the Raptors, and won 5-6 straight with wins over TOR, CLE, CHA, etc.).

Anyway, if you watch 7 games series long enough you recognize patterns (from all sports). Game 3 is consistently one of the WORST games to judge a series based on, when one team has a 2-0 lead.

In all NBA playoffs, the team up 2-0 has won the series 93.6% of the time.

The 2-0 team also has a disgusting 43.2% record in game 3. That's just over a 50% difference between the eventual series outcome and game 3. (The home team up 2-0 has an even lower record, 41.4%).

http://www.whowins.com/tables/up20.html - Source

For data, you can also view 2-1, etc. Note that when up 3-1, the winning percentage jumps dramatically.

This is the nature of complacency, and as can be seen by the numbers, is very common. (See the Hawks smacking the Wizards today for example). 

The interesting part is when up 3-1, that winning percentage jumps big time for game 5. In fact, Game 3 has the WORST percentage chance to win for a team leading a series 2-0, or any team leading a series beyond that point. (2-1, 3-1, 3-2).

"Let me repeat myself: Fred Hoiberg is not a good coach.

He has never been a good NBA coach. He was not NBA ready. And this isn't the result of one loss, because the root of his horrible coaching has been evident since his arrival. It's because if i posted this after two big time playoff wins, i would get shit. Let's begin.

**GOOD COACHES INNOVATE**

Fred Hoiberg was hailed as a pace-and-space coach when brought in by Gar Forman. Since then, the Bulls have successfully been one of the worst three point shooting teams in the league, and seem to actively avoid utilizing set plays to get much desired ""spacing""- instead, Hoiberg opts for a freelance offense, often dictated by either the point guard or whoever touches the ball more. This is why Rondo has looked like a god the last two games- he bought into the system, it's the playoffs, and he knows Fred can't do shit to save the Bulls' horrible inefficient offense. Even after finally placing Jimmy Butler at the point guard position and getting results, Fred insisted on putting in Jerian Grant or Michael Carter-Williams.

**GOOD COACHES ADJUST**

During games 1 and 2, both wins, the defensive gameplan seemed to be working. But why? It was simply because the Celtics were shooting an awful percentage, despite getting wide open looks. The Bulls took the shape of an amoeba, constantly leaving wings and guards open from 3. Well, Brad Stevens is a competent coach, so naturally he adjusted and the Celtics not only shot a better percentage, they would consistently run the same play over and over again. And again. And again. The Celtics ran high screens for any big man that had legs; Horford, Olynyk, Zeller, even Gerald Green as a 4. It was embarrassing to think that Hoiberg thought he could get away with having zero defensive game plan and beat a 1 seed.

**GOOD COACHES LEAD**

Leadership has always been in short supply for Chicago ever since Joakim Noah and Derrick Rose became injured simultaneously, but this 2016-2017 series has been a shitshow in terms of the age old question of ""who is leading this team?"". The answer is ""not Fred Hoiberg"". Jimmy Butler, Dwyane Wade, and even Rajon Rondo have all hinted at Fred losing the locker room and not trusting the vets. Thibs captured the locker room's attention, whether it be with an iron fist or not. Fred seems to he disrespected at every turn, but rookies and vets alike. On the court, Hoiberg is as vocal as Lovie Smith. He has received only one technical foul in 2 seasons, and other than that, has been silent. Never energetic, never worried despite good reason to be. Hoiberg seems disinterested and lost at some points, and even his staff can't help him.  

**GOOD COAHES WIN**

The Bulls' streak of making the post season ended last season, when Fred Hoiberg joined the Bulls and took a team that had finals potential and allowed them to miss the playoffs. This season, the Bulls got into the playoffs in a near tiebreaker. Now, this isn't all Hoiberg's fault- but it is fishy how a team with as much talent as we have looks downright awful.

"Rondo's injury is not a deal breaker for me, and here's why:

RoLo still severely outmatches the Celtics in the paint. He's not going to be stopped on the glass unless the Celtics want to get into foul trouble. His midrange jumpers have also been unstoppable and the Celtics bigs have neither the length nor the athleticism to contest them. 

We still have leadership on the floor. I expect Wade to see more minutes and handle the ball more along with Jimmy. Grant would essentially just provide shooting, which he can do very well. Wade and Jimmy can rally us back whenever Celtics go on runs, and they will run the plays and direct traffic in Rondo's absence. Jimmy and Wade can move the ball around and find open shooters just as well as Rondo, and at this point we just need our guys like Niko, Portis, Zipser, and Grant to hit their shots like they've done so far. 

Lastly, we play the next 2 games at home. We have homecourt, and we already have a 2-game lead. If this were Game 1 in Boston, I would understand the anxiety. This post isn't aimed at discrediting Rondo, I truly believe his command of the floor has been absolutely huge for us, but this team has the ability to get it done without him.","Rondo is not necessary to beat the Celtics Rondo's injury is not a deal breaker for me, and here's why:

"I know this isn't a new concept, but the Bulls continue to struggle when they are on the court together. I also realize it has been one game, but they had the same problems in the regular season. 

In Game 1:

The net rating when the three were on the floor together was -12.1.

Jimmy's Alone Net Rtg: -1.6
Wade Alone Net Rtg: -0.3
Rondo Alone Net Rtg: -6

All better than when on they were on the court together. Hoiberg isn't just starting them for pride/appearance reasons (a.k.a. not playing together after first subs) as they played 19 minutes together in game 1; tied for third most among 3 man lineups.

They were just brutal offensively. There were 15, 3 man line ups that played at least 12 minutes together and their offense rating was last (89.6).

19 total minutes and one game are fairly meaningless alone, but this is a continuation from the regular season when they played 591 minutes (10th most for 3 man line up). The issues weren't as exaggerated of course, but still comparatively worse than other line ups. Of all 3-man line ups that played at least 240 minutes together (5 full games worth), they were 30 of 39 in net rating. 

Despite this unoriginal complaining, I actually think Hoiberg gets a tough break a lot of the time. However, this is an issue that appears to be obvious to casual fans, writers, and others in the league, but we still persist. Three players who want the ball, have a tendency to go iso, and dont space the floor well do not lead to a productive offense.

Biggest surprise to me was Rajon Rondo's 10.6 BPM.

Also, it's easy to forget that until midway through the third quarter Jimmy Butler wasn't playing well.

From reading the comments of Celtics fans, it seems like Kelly Olynyk and Al Horford are often blamed when they lose.  Yet according to BPM, Amir Johnson and Jae Crowder underperformed the most.  (You can ignore Demetrius Jackson, he only played 17 minutes of garbage time this season for the Celtics.)

"I think for us to win this series, it's going to come down to whether or not we can lock down Boston's offense, and get a decent amount of high quality shots off rather than whether we can outshoot them. I do believe it is entirely possible.

The Celtics will most likely trot out a rotation of:

Isaiah Thomas
Avery Bradley
Jae Crowder
Amir Johnson
Al Horford

Marcus Smart
Kelly Olynyk
Jalen Brown
Jerebko/Rozier?

The thing about Boston's starting lineup is that it is full of players that play well off a star (namely IT) but they can't get their own shot off. For example, the random three point shooting outburst we saw from Amir Johnson in our second game against the Celtics probably won't happen in the playoffs. Therefore when Jimmy and Co get locked in on Thomas when the game starts to get more tense I feel like the Celtics might resort to running a lot of pick and pop offense between Thomas and Horford which may cause a drastic decrease of the rate at which the Celtics put the ball in the basket, and a slowed down game is something I feel like we would benefit from.

Secondly, the bench. Marcus Smart has been struggling mightily as of late and I wouldn't rely on him at all to create any sort of meaningful offense of his own. That leaves us with the bottom end of the rotation. Olynyk is just a worse version of Horford in my opinion, a decent to good shooter that doesn't rebound well for their size. Jalen Brown should not, and will not be able to shoulder any offensive load in the postseason, that's pretty much all I have to say on him. He's an inconsistent shooter at best although he has shown the ability to attack the basket with some success.

Lastly and most importantly is the rebounding. Hands down we have the Celtics beat in rebounding, this will be a key (if not the most important) element to our victory, and having Rondo Wade and Jimmy as great rebounding perimeter players will only compliment Lopez's tenacity when boxing out equally sized bigs to himself.

Even if the Celtics do make it past us, their biggest weakness is their lack of a second star that can create his own shot. Cleveland have two, Toronto have two, Washington have two, even we have two. I just don't think that beyond Thomas and Horford the Celtics have the offensive chops to make a deep playoff run, and I believe we do stand a decent chance against them in this series.

Edit: Maybe being tired is making me talk out of my rear end, but let me know what you guys think of this.","Defensive matchup I think for us to win this series, it's going to come down to whether or not we can lock down Boston's offense, and get a decent amount of high quality shots off rather than whether we can outshoot them.

"I know it is unpopular to support the Bulls right now but how about an alternative view of the last few years and months?

**Thibs grinded the previous regime into the ground. Too many minutes, too many nights. For instance, last season, Noah had the WORST FG% IN THE HISTORY OF THE NBA in shots with in 5 feet of the rim of anyone 6'10"" or taller.  Think that is a coincidence? Why doesn't anyone talk about what a great decision it was to NOT pay Noah anything last July? Knicks gave him 72 million? It's literally the worst contract in the NBA.

**Thibs gets a pass because the media loves him. How did he do this year? Well his team was the most UNDERACHIEVING (based on Vegas O/U win totals) of ANY in the NBA? Again, he's grinding his guys in Minnesota. 2 of the top 5 leaders in min/game this season play for Thibs. 

**If you don't love the Fred hire, that's fine. But what is not debatable is the roster Fred inherited did not fit what Fred wanted to do. A PG and a center that literally can't shoot? Rose & Noah couldn't have been poorer fits for Fred. 

**Anyone think it's a coincidence that Butler's WORST 3pt shooting seasons always came when Rose was healthy?  Rose was a TERRIBLE passer and does not create offense for others. 

**After last season's debacle of a team/roster, the organization had a decision to make in June. 

1) Trade Jimmy & rebuild from scratch with the HOPES of getting a top 3 pick.

2) Or, build around Jimmy by getting rid of Thibs regime players that can't play anymore and adding SHORT TERM veterans to go along side of the young players who by NBA standards are on GREAT contracts. The best thing the Bulls front office did was secure players without locking themselves into any bad long term deals. They can pay Rondo 3m to leave. Wade is only one more year (if he picks up option). Look at what some of those other teams did last July?! 

They've made the play-offs doing option #2 and can still rebuild if the offer is right. But why trade Butler unless the Celtics are willing to put the Nets pick in UNPROTECTED (which they've never been willing to do up until now). 

I'm perfectly fine critizing draft picks & trades that fail (Doug, Teague)...but doing that while never bringing up great picks and trades is careless. Go look at the general track record of picks outside the lottery, it's not good. Bulls have drafted Butler (star) and others who are servicable. Valentine and Portis aren't all-stars but they're BETTER than most picks in that range. Don't be lazy, go look!

Boy I'm glad we didn't pay Allen Crabbe 75 million, Noah & Deng 72 million or Parsons 70 million. 

It's ok to wish the Bulls were better. But to blindlessly kill GarPax for some of the mistakes Thibs made is careless and just not true.

It was published 2 weeks ago on 3/29/17 

I'll post a (rough) translation of the Interview here, pls dont kill me over it. Its not word for word but I think I got the points he made:

**""The Bulls have hope in me""**

**As a rookie Paul Zipser is already part of the regular rotation on the Chicago Bulls. Spox met the 23 year old wing player to talk about playoff seeding, the rookie wall, crunchtime minutes and the american way of life**

**Spox**: Paul, when we last talked right after the draft we didnt know what trials would come your way. Now you are a starter on the Chicago Bulls. Thats pretty crazy, right?

**Paul Zipser**: Yes! You better believe that!(laughing). In the beginning of the season everything was pretty new to me but I had a lot of time to work on things and I developed quite a bit during the year. Thats why coach starts to trust me. I am really happy to get more playing time now and my confidence grows with every minute gametime.

**S**:After a good start the Bulls had a couple of problems and right now you are just outside of the playoffs. How would you describe the season so far?

**PZ**: A bit bumpy would describe it the best. We had good stretches and bad ones. There was just no consistency. Every team has to go through that but I would have wished for the team to be more of a unit. Unfortunately, that was always the case but it is better now.

**S**: Right now Chicago is in ninth place but just 3 games out of the 5th place. How do you aproach the fight for a spot in the playoffs?

**PZ**: Our playoffs already started. Every game is incredibly important since the standing in the east is so tight. I think you can see, that we improved since our last losing-stretch. Right now we gotta push and fight for the ball. Especially next week is going to be very important.

**S**: Personally things started falling in place for you in january. What was your reaction when you first heard you were gonna start in your first game?

**PZ**: It was pretty surprising and of course I was happy! It was my first game in MSG - a really aweing arena. And that as a starter? That was really cool.

**S**:Soon after Coach Hoiberg started giving you crunchtime minutes. Do you tend to be nervous or is every minute just like any other?

**PZ**: Of course, the end of the game is the most important. You wanna show some action, iniiate plays. You are out there to get the W. Thats a bit harder to accomplish sitting on the bench (laughing). Especially as a rookie I didnt expect to be called upon in crunchtime. But I think that I helped winning a lot of games. Thats something you will always remember.

**S**:How did the situation change after DWades elbow injury?

**PZ**: That was like a punch in the guts since Wade is one of our backbones. We had a couple of games without him but it is hard that he is out for the season. For us other wing players that means oportunity to play more but that also means that we have more responsiblities. I can be one of those guys.

**S**: Lately your role changed a lot from being a started to coming of the bench to DNP-CD. How does the team communicate that and how do you react?

**PZ**: Sometimes Coach tells me before the game soemtimes he doesnt. The amount of minutes is dependend on the flow of the game. Thats not a problem for me. It is not about having a fixed spot on the roster. Its about going out there and deliver whenever it is needed.

**S**: Do you have any connections back to the BBL? 

**PZ**: Of course! I follow the series Ulm is playing. Their play is really surprising this year. I am in good contact with Bayern because of Maxi Kleber. I follow Bamberg a little and I always tune in to see how Johannes Voigtmann is doing in spain.

**S**: How do you like the american way of life?

**PZ**: American way of life. (thinking) Hmm. I don't know. I am not the kinda guy that always has to have the latest in everything. I try to keep away from fastfood - even though I had to try (laughing). But I am getting used to everything quite well: lots of travels, many games and very little practice. I am comfortable and my girlfriend and me are settling in in Chicago. You get recognized on the streets alot more than in germany. When I walk through the city on my own or with friends people recognize me a lot.

**S**: 5.1 p/g, 2.8 r/g, 0.7 a/g, 39.9% from the field and a 32.4 from three. Those are your stats at the moment. What stat are you tracking the closest?

**PZ**: Honestly? I dont look at stats. Like at all.

**S**: What does the departure of Taj Gibson and Doug McDermott mean for you?

**PZ**: Well, if you trade someone who is playing the 2 or 3 spot and you get a point guard in return, there will be more room for me. I reckon the trade was made for me in part. The Bulls have high hopes in me and I will work on my game a lot during the summer.

**S**: Is there difference in the refs behavior towards vet and and rookies?

**PZ**: Yeah. There is. When we played the wizards that was really extreme. THere was nothing I could have done to draw a foul. But that was a pretty physical game and that changes things anyway.

**S**: You worked on your playmaking lately. Whats your main focus during practice at the moment?

**PZ**: Right now I take care of my body and try to stay healthy. There is really no time to practice. It might sound funny but the only time that you can practice is during the off-season.

**S**: Do you still notice you ankle injury from february? 

**PZ**: Unfortunately yes. The ankle hurts from time to time and limits me. It takes away a bit of explosion. But I gotta fight through it. There arent that many games ahead anymore. After that I can take care of my ankle but right now its about winning games. 

**S**: What can you tell us about the famous rookie wall? Is it real?

**PZ**: Oh yeah. It hit me hard! It didnt take long, maybe a week, but I was exhausted all the time. first of all mentally but physically as well. On top of that I had the injury but I think I managed quite well. I am satisfied with my performance and if we start winning now every thing will be fine.

"So assuming it all goes right tonight, we win and pacers win. How do you think we perform?

I think we can do pretty well and could even possibly take the series ; our strength in rebounding is their weakness, and in a more physical setting I reckon IT will have a harder time especially being their primary way to score.

"Just wanted to let you know I'm rooting for you guys, and so are a lot of other Celtic fans.

No, this is not a reverse jinks.  Nor is it arrogance or someone hoping to avoid this team or get that one -- the Bulls will be a tough out for anyone, and these Celtics' visits to the playoffs have lasted approximately as long as Andrew Bogut's career as a Cleveland Cavalier.  

I just love watching Jimmy Butler and, yes, our old fave Rondo play (especially playoff and TNT Rondo).    

So yah, I'm rooting Bulls against the Nets (hey, they've already clinched all those ping pong balls) -- and hoping to see you all in round one.  Don't worry about the Heat score.  It's like DWade says, just beat the friggin Brooklyn Nets.

Plus he is looking like a much better distributor of the ball finding open teammates and etc last 3 or 4 games as well in general he's gotten better at running an offense.

"Although I'm pretty bummed the Bulls didn't clinch today, it sets up the perfect scenario for the Bulls in their seedings and matchup assuming the dominos all fall in place (as they should) 

Bulls control their own destiny. All they need to do is win at home against the worst team, the Nets.  Lock up 8th seed

Indiana has not clinched a playoff berth so they have everything to play for and will look to win their game at home against Hawks who don't have too much to play for. Lock up 7th seed with win. 

With the Cavs loss, Boston just needs to win at home against the Bucks to secure the #1 seed 

This leads to the Bulls facing the Celtics in the first round, and more importantly, avoiding the Cavs until the Conference finals.  In my mind that's the perfect scenario for a possible Bulls playoff run and it has a really good chance of happening!

"Edit:  The title should be ""The last Shot"" 

Today's game was the third time in about two weeks where the Bulls were faced with a last possession shot at the end of a game that could either tie or win a game.  Jimmy, not surprisingly, has taken all three of those shots and has missed all three, badly.  

Now I'm not saying that JB is not an all world type of franchise of a beast player because he undoubtedly is.  Nor am I saying that he does not deserve to be taking those last shots.  However, what I am saying is that watching him let the clock dwindle down while he gets a high post from Lopez only for that clock to wind all the way down as he is taking a fall away deep three is worthless.  And this has happened the last three times the Bulls were facing a do or die possession late in the game.  

Now I know that Fred Hoiberg has forgotten more basketball than I will ever know but it is so painful to watch these last possessions.  Sure he got a questionable touch call off Marcus Smart late that decided the game right before the All-Star break, but since then, the last three times this has not worked out remotely well for the Bulls.  Wouldn't they be better served to possibly work the ball around some?  A wide open Miritic 3 would not be hard to create and would at least give the Bulls a chance in these situations not some garbage falling away bullshit hail mary.  

also edit: I want Butler taking the last shot my OP was incomplete. But it needs to be a better closer shot not a fall away desperation more than obvious three which is not his game. Or an open shot from anyone is better than a prayer at the buzzer.","Butler taking the last shot Edit:  The title should be ""The last Shot""

"Hey Bullbros, just a few questions here. Hope that's ok. They are:

- Do the bulls seem headed toward contention or rebuilding?
- If the latter, what would it take to pry Robin Lopez away?
- Would the Bulls FO consider something like Meyers Leonard + picks for Rolo?
- If so, what picks would it take to get it done?

Why Bulls do it: If you are entering a rebuild as some have suggested (and maybe that's no longer accurate), a trade like this would give you picks and a prospect that, if healthy can be a high impact player. If he's not healthy then he can give you big minutes while still helping you tank. Obviously the picks would be the main attraction here though. We could send you the CLE first this Summer, or maybe a Lottery protected future first, like 2019 perhaps? I guess it all depends on what direction the Bulls are headed. If you plan to continue building around Butler and looking to contend, this trade makes no sense whatsoever. If your FO plans to trade Butler this Summer tho, and enter a rebuild, this is exactly the kind of trade you should be looking at. Rolo is too good for a tank, and you need picks and prospects instead of vets who likely won't still be in their prime once the rebuild is over.

Why Portland does it: Blazers badly need a backup Center who can do centery things like rebound and not suck. Leonard could be those things if he gets healthy but it's a wash as to whether that happens soon, and Blazers want to contend beginning next season, so we don't want to wait on him anymore. Rolo was a great fit with Dame, has established chemistry with team, coach and fans, and was probably the most 'Portland weird' player we've ever had (aside from maybe big red). He would be a welcome addition as our back up center, and I think he'd be fine coming off the bench back in PDX.

So what do you guys/gals think? Is this something you could see happening, or am I wishing down the wrong well?

"My usual conspiracy theory is that, the Bulls are trying to make the playoffs with the least amount of wins. It's a matter of picking 16th or 18th, if they are making the playoffs. Which for me does matter in this deep draft.


But of course, nobody want to face the Cavs in the first round...


With the Cavs winning against Boston yesterday, they'll most likely get the number 1 seed.


Bulls will likely end up facing Boston if they stay at 7th.


So...


Is Boston really a good match-up in the first round than Toronto?


We have a lot of big PG on the roster. But Jimmy is likely the one who will guard Isaiah Thomas. Then Wade and the supporting cast could score for the team.


If Bulls got Toronto, it will be a tough physical game. Something nobody wants to be in, especially if you can go up against them as much as seven times.


Hence, Bulls for me are playing for two reason now. 


1) Get in the playoffs while getting the highest pick possible.


2) Playoff positioning.","Bulls trying to get the C's in the playoffs? My usual conspiracy theory is that, the Bulls are trying to make the playoffs with the least amount of wins. It's a matter of picking 16th or 18th, if they are making the playoffs. Which for me does matter in this deep draft.

"We talk about the struggles of this team shooting the three, but did you realize that we're actually the 29th ranked team in the NBA at 2P% as opposed to 26th in 3P%? 

The Bulls are surprisingly clean on defense, committing just 17.7 Fouls Per Game, 2nd lowest in the league.

We're the best offensive rebounding team in the NBA and second best overall. You'd think our rebounding would have suffered after losing Taj, but Portis and Felicio have really stepped up, both averaging over 10 RPG per 36, compared to Robin Lopez's 8. 

Anthony Morrow was an afterthought in the OKC trade. Did you know he's averaging 50/57/100 shooting splits since putting on the Bulls jersey? Cameron Payne, meanwhile, shoots 33/32/25.

Jimmy is 4th in the NBA in steals per game and is by far the cleanest thief in the league, averaging 1.24 steals per foul. For comparison, the league leader in steals, Draymond Green, averages 0.71 steals per foul. 

Rajon Rondo leads the team in 3pt %, yet his true shooting % is the last on the team among qualified players. His 2FG% is that atrocious, and he's one of the worst ft shooters in the NBA.

Chicago is last in the NBA in Effective Field Goal %.

According to PER, Paul Zipser is the worst player in the NBA to average more than 15 mpg. He has a 6.38. 

Tom Thibodeau had less losses in his first two seasons combined than Hoiberg has in either of his seasons.

In the past 27 years, only one Bulls team has had a worse defensive rating than this year's squad: the 2008-2009 Bulls.

Only 3 Bulls have ever had a season with higher win shares than Jimmy Butler has had this year. Chet Walker in 1971, Derrick Rose his MVP year, and MJ. Jimmy has a very slim chance of actually having more than Derrick if he closes the season out like a maniac. 

Not counting Anthony Morrow's NBA-leading 159 ORTG, Felicio has the highest Offensive rating on the team with 125. Jimmy is second at 123. MCW is last at 91, unless you count Payne's horrifying 80. 

Our best defenders according to DRTG are Rondo, MCW, and Nikola Mirotic at 106. Jimmy at 107. Zipser, Canaan, and Lopez are our worst defenders. 

Robin Lopez is the only regular starts with a negative Box Plus Minus. Jimmy has a 6.8 compared to Rolo's -1.0. Zipser is rocking a -4.2

Looking at per 36 and advanced stats, Felicio has been better than Robin Lopez in almost every way. Higher win shares in half the minutes, almost 10% higher FG% TS, higher Per, higher ORB and ORB%, higher DRB and DRB%, APG, SPG, and less turnovers.

He is not a moron, he probably sees the progress and development of chemistry in his absence and i think in no way shape or form he will destroy that after he comes back, i think he will turn up a gear or two and be competitive as hell as well as leader on the court. 

I just hope we get to the play-offs and somehow avoid the Cavs, anything can happen we've seen so many sports miracles these past few years why not the Bulls be one of them.","Opinion on D-Wade It's obvious that the team clicked after his injury, probably related to that but we are talking about Dwayne Fucking Wade.

"Disclaimer: this thought *could* be dismissed due to an uncanny stretch if 'good luck' to explain our current form, but I believe in these guys and their current play - so I'm moving forward under the guide of ""our guys are finally clicking and playing great ball"".

From my view I'm seeing a team that, post trading McBuckets and Gibson, and since losing Wade to injury, has grown exceptionally in confidence and chemistry. I'm seeing a team who, if this streak continues, will be going into the playoffs with an insanely high level of optimism and energy - the kinds of things which could get them further than the first round.

What happens when you put Wade back in there (under the assumption he's back for the playoffs)? Essentially he'd be taking ball time/shots from the very players who have gained so much from *having more shots* and game time (I'm thinking of Zipser, Mirotic, and Valentine specifically)

You'd also be removing a pass-first, shoot-later (most of the team) PG in Rondo who, personally, I'd love to see in the starting 5 come playoff time.

My gut feeling: I think Wade coming back would potentially be a detriment to current team form.

"I judged him too soon, y'all were right. I posted that post about a month ago about how shitty he was. I had watched his first 3 games with the Bulls and he seemed pathetic. He has since began to warm up to me. While he's been finding his place with the Bulls, Bulls fans have been finding their place with him. 

Yes, he's a little soft. (European)
Yes, he misses a lot. (2nd round pick)
Yes, it's hard to put confidence in him because he looks so clumsy and out of place. (7 feet and hairstyle)

But honestly, he isn't bad for 10-18 minutes in a game. I would not start him over Lopez or (healthy) Felicio, but he does his job. (Considering Bobby as a PF)

I'm excited to watch the Bulls whoop the Cavs or Toronto in the first round and see how far they can take it. I get Wade will come back and mess with rotations, but I wouldn't be opposed to seeing a few minutes stick with Lauvergne.

Yes, it's hard to put confidence in him because he looks so clumsy and out of place. (7 feet and hairstyle)

But honestly, he isn't bad for 10-18 minutes in a game. I would not start him over Lopez or (healthy) Felicio, but he does his job. (Considering Bobby as a PF)

I'm excited to watch the Bulls whoop the Cavs or Toronto in the first round and see how far they can take it. I get Wade will come back and mess with rotations, but I wouldn't be opposed to seeing a few minutes stick with Lauvergne.

Let me know if you guys feel the same way.",20,56,"K, Lauvergne isn't bad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/633csq/k_lauvergne_isnt_bad/

"We won't have a great draft pick and we probably won't make it out of the first round, so how do we improve this off-season? Do we trade Butler for younger guys and picks and start a rebuild? Or try to build around him again? Keep or don't keep Rondo? Let Niko walk or not? 

Personally, I don't think trading Jimmy is the right move yet. I say give it this next  year and if we make the second round of the playoffs, keep it up. Anything less then that, THEN you trade him while he's still worth something, even if it is slightly less then we would have gotten this year. I'm hoping Jimmy has an even better year next year though.

What I think we SHOULD do is this: 

Keep Niko, MCW Felicio as long as the combined cost isn't more than about $18M.

Buyout Rondo's contract for $3M before it garauntees for the next season on June 30. Also buyout Canaan's.

Let all other FA's walk.

Now let's assume that Niko, MCW, and Felicio's contracts are around $15M total. Maybe $8.5M to Niko, $2.5M to Felicio, and $4M to MCW. This should leave us with about $21M in cap space if I did my math right. This is also all assuming Wade stays since I don't think he wants to go through free agency again.

I think we should sign Jrue Holiday for around $12M, then sign JJ Redick for $5M, and PJ Tucker for $4M.

Our depth chart would then look like this:

PG: Holiday, MCW, Grant, Payne
SG: Wade, Redick, Valentine
SF: Butler, Zipser, Tucker
PF: Niko, Portis
C: Lopez, Felicio

These are mostly minor changes. We could obviously do a lot more if Wade left or we let Niko walk but only time will tell. Just my thoughts.

"Think about it. This whole organization is like something from 'Major League' or 'The Replacements' or 'The Mighty Ducks'. Everyone seems to occupy one trope character role or another. I'm convinced this is actually an underdog sports movie we're watching in real-time.


We have an incompetent management team trying to chase former glory while doing things counter-intuitive to actually winning (GarPax). There's surely a sleezeball (Riensdorf) more focused on profits than having a good team. Classic setup for team/management conflict.

Fred Hoiberg is the ""hapless small town coach"" who has no idea on how to inspire this ragtag, ill-fitting team. He's a classic main focus of these types of films.

Jimmy Butler is the ""young hot shot"". He's got incredible talent, but a wild bravado that needs to be wrangled in to make him a solid leader. 

Dwayne Wade is the ""old veteran"". He joined the team for his last chance at a playoff run. He's frustrated by the shit-show going on around him and probably pines over his glory days. He naturally takes a mentor role for the ""young hot shot"". 

Rajon Rondo is the ""mouthy asshole"", the guy no one really seems to like and should be dealt away, but either no one wants him or he's too good of a player to dump. 

Robin Lopez is the ""weird guy"". He's the character that provides most of the comic relief and breaks the more tense moments with a timely mascot fight. 

Nikola Mirotic is the ""foreign guy"". He's also a bit of comic relief as his goofy accent and unfamiliarity with American culture creates some entertaining moments. He also possesses a savant-like skill that could save the team if he learns to harness it properly and adjusts to the way the game is played in the states.

Denzel Valentine is ""the rookie"". He's the guy often pushed to the background, but firmly believes he can make an impact of the coach just puts him in. 

Lebron James and the Cavs are the ""divisional rivals"". Not only are they the most consistent source of frustration for the team, they're the reigning champs and have the best player on earth. Their constant mocking drives the Bulls to play their best. If the Bulls make the playoffs they're likely the team they'll have to face. It's a pivotal showdown that is the climax of the movie. 



Can this band of misfits learn how to play together while also learning to play *for* each other? They better figure it out fast, because the end of the season is approaching fast and they stand on the cusp of making the playoffs! Even if they do, their bitter rivals and the reigning champs stand in their way.

"Rondo has his faults and the bulls have a team option on him.  They have talked about using that as trade bait to get other free agents signed here.  

To me the team has been playing so much better only because the bulls have been adapting to a modern offense, letting a PG be the primary ball handler. Jimmy (last year and majority of this year) and wade have been used as the primary ball handler/pg role and the team imo has struggled for it even if they have good games or high assist games(example loss to 76ers rondo played 20 minutes jimmy 36 points 11 assists but the team got handled).  

The team has been having higher assist more ball movement when they allow rondo to have control of the offense.  This is one of the reasons why I have had problems with hoiberg this same thing was happening last season when he let the offense be run thru the pg the team plays better but lets the players freelance too much.

I finally realized that they just wanted to get rid of Doug. They gave up a lot to draft him and he didn't perform anywhere near what they expected. They were so embarrassed by there evaluation blunder that they did whatever they had to to get rid of him. They even threw in an expiring contract with Taj and a 2nd rounder for a deal the thunder couldn't refuse.

" Dwyane was really cooking in feburary, Was shooting over 50% overall, 42.9% from 3. He was averaging 21.1 Points, 5.4 Assists, and 6.4 rebounds.

 Then March came around and he started shooting like 38%, 18% from 3, and only averaged 13.7 points a game.

Weird little slump, or maybe he just really benefits from rest(like the all star break). I'm betting we can expect the kind of performance he put out in February, if we make the playoffs.","Did anyone else Notice this? D-Wade...

"If you guys are interested, I am hoping to start a playoffs race thread each Friday for the remainder of the regular season to discuss the Bulls race to the playoffs. Not too long ago, I posted [this Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k5LHxIz6wj1VIbHuXkbzNc7H14naQXyqfuXgvgwWb-o/edit#gid=0) that I am updating daily with each day's results.

Since I created this sheet earlier this week, the latest seeding is as follows: 6. Milwaukee, 7. Indiana, 8. Miami, 9. Chicago (1 GB, Tiebreak over Detroit), 10. Detroit (1GB), 11. Charlotte (2.5 GB)

As it stands, the Bulls have the easiest schedule of any team fighting for a spot according to stats.nba.com. Miami, who happens to be the team the Bulls need to jump to take the 8th seed, has the most difficult schedule (made more difficult with the loss of Dion Waiters for a yet undetermined length of time).



**Current Tiebreakers:**

CHI holds tiebreaker over MIA, CHA, DET (on division record).

DET holds tiebreaker MIA (1 game remaining), CHA.

MIA holds tiebreaker over MIL, IND.

MIL holds tiebreaker over CHI, DET (1 game remaining), IND.

IND holds tiebreaker over DET, CHI (on division record).

CHA holds tiebreaker over MIL (2 games remaining), MIA (one game remaining), IND (on conference record).




Overall, the path to the playoffs is there for the Bulls, we only have 2 games left against .500 or better teams. As we all know that really doesn't mean much to this team but if we start beating teams we're supposed to we should have no problem getting in. I know a lot of people in this sub want to tank but I don't think there is enough time to tank to make much of an impact on the draft especially since its going to be pretty hard to lose some of these games even if we tried. In my personal opinion, its better to get swept in the playoffs than be the first team left out.

"We should 100% draft Frank Mason III from Kansas with our 2nd rounder. We have the 35th pick or something like that.

He's undersized but a ridiculously talented scorer and shooter. He's got a high shot and release that is lightning fast, and he's a very gifted passer.

I think he could be a steal, and considering we're looking like we want to make the playoffs instead of tanking for a higher pick (which is fine with me, very good for player development), it would be a no risk high reward pick.","With our history of overperforming under-sized PGs...

"I figured after his great playmaking role game against Detroit yesterday, now would be a good time to bring this up.  *This is not at all a hit piece against Butler, but his numbers this late into the season are concerning.  All it means is that he is a much better player, and the team is better off, with the following being said.*

I saw a number of people in the post game thread saying that even though distributing Butler is good and helps the team, it's a ""meme"" at this point that iso-Butler is bad for the team and that we need that when the team is doing poorly.

Unfortunately, this is simply not true.  Overall, the Chicago Bulls average 1.037 points per possession, i.e. every possession this season they will score an average of 1.037 points.  That puts us at 22nd in the league overall--we simply do not score very efficiently.

Jimmy Butler averages .91 points per iso-possession, at a rate of 13.1%, and has an effective field goal percentage in those situations of 40.6%.  In iso-situations he gets to the free throw line at a rate of 16.7%.  That .91 points per iso-possesion is **145th** in the league.  The rate at which he takes iso possessions is **28th** in the league.  His effective field goal percentage in those situations is ***188th*** in the league.  The rate at which he gets to the line is **87th** in the league, so he's not even making up for his very poor numbers by getting to the line at a good rate.

In other words, Butler isos at one of the highest rates in the league, and is easily one of the worst iso-scorers in the league.  He has abysmally low percentages and numbers in iso-situations.  As a way of comparison, the 76ers, easily the worst PPP team in the league, averages .99 points per possession.  Butler's iso game doesn't even rise to the level of the worst offense in the NBA, let alone to the level of the Bulls'.

Butler averages 6.6 assists in wins, 4.2 in losses, on top of that.  And what's more, even in losses, the time people say Butler needs more than ever to go iso-ball, the Bulls as a team have an effective field goal percentage of 44.3%, still significantly higher than Butler's percentage.  On average, then, we are more likely to make a basket through regular movement than we are through Butler isos, in fact demonstrably so.

Is this the case for every individual game?  No, of course not.  But this late into the season, yeah, the numbers are fairly conclusive overall.","Regardless of whether we are shooting well, the Bulls are better when Butler distributes and does not iso I figured after his great playmaking role game against Detroit yesterday, now would be a good time to bring this up.  *This is not at all a hit piece against Butler, but his numbers this late into the season are concerning.

"Like most people, I was pissed when we traded Taj, Doug, and a second for OKC's table scraps. At the time, it seemed like the consensus was that Cameron Payne would be the biggest asset in the trade. We know how that worked out; Payne is possibly our worst PG, and now he's hurt (though just recalled from D-League). But over the last few games, as Lauvergne has gotten more run, I'm starting to think he's the most promising piece. Sure, he makes stupid mistakes and is wildly inconsistent at the FT line, but he can occasionally hit threes and he's got the ability to burn big men (especially heavier ones like Drummond) if they close out too hard. I guess I'm just hoping Lauvergne can turn into something; maybe I'm still in denial that we gave away Gibson for nothing but musty granola and horse teeth.

"I'm 3-0 at the UC (never been to a road game) and the first game I cannot for the life of me remember that well (didn't follow basketball closely at the time). My cousin (who was also there, we're around the same age) believes that Shaq was injured during the first quarter and after some Googling I've found a few dates (Dec. 27 2006 and Jan. 27 2007) that might be it but Shaq is benched both games (according to ESPN's recaps of those games). This was for sure pre-Rose but I'm not so sure if Shaq was on the Heat yet. Not a whole lot to go on I know but I know for sure the Bulls had won.

"Prior to Taj and Doug trade to the Oklahoma city Thunder I had believed that this team was going after the playoffs.  After that horrible trade I started having doubts about the goals set for this team by Garpax.  Instead of improving their team for a potential playoff run Garpax traded away two decent players and a second round draft pick for a project point guard. Amongst the players they traded was the best three point shooter on the team which was strange because that was an area of need for us. Then the team started losing much more than normal and Dwayne Wade got a season ending injury.  Sooo at this point I am wondering what the hell is this team trying do?  If anything I think Garpax is orchestrating a massive lie to the fanbase. Garpax wants you to believe that the team is trying to compete for the playoffs that way they can keep selling tickets and merchandise but in reality  their plan all along has been to get ""young and more athletic"".  What the Taj/Doug trade did was lower salary cap, made the team younger, and overall it made them a worse team.  It is even possible that Garpax will use the extra cap space to help facilitate a Jimmy Butler trade in the offseason.  This madness will never stop until Garpax is fired once and for all.  

Edit: I put Golden State Warriors instead of the thunder so I changed it.(Sorry about that I always get them mixed up because of Durant)","Are the Bulls trying to make the playoffs or are they trying to tank for a better draft pick?

"So, looking at everything now that the dust has settled.

We traded an expiring contract, a young, really good 3pt shooter who was having some inconsistency problems but nevertheless still had bright moments (after a rocky start in OKC is up to 43/37/90), and a second round pick, for two expiring contracts, neither of whom we will resign, and a project point guard, now in the D-League when we already have 2.5 other project point guards.

"*First and foremost, I do not have an answer to this question, I was hoping that would be the discussion we would have below.*

*That being said, I would like to start a conversation that disspells this notion that a smart team is either contending for a title or outright tanking.*

*Now, to be fair, the Bulls have pigeon-holed themselves in to less options than other franchises, but generally speaking, the idea that the Bulls are either title contenders or in full on tank mode is not only wrong, it fails to allow the fan bases to celebrate successes over the course of a long season, not to mention years following a certain team. So let's define some terms.*

**Tanking** - Trying to be as bad as possible on the court in order to garner a greater chance of a decent draft pick. Generally, this means benching your healthy veterans for no real reason and playing a myriad of rotations to make sure nobody develops a consistent rhythm and accidentally wins you a few games. *Example: Los Angeles Lakers*

**Rebuilding** - Trying to be as good as possible in the long term. You may sacrifice a few games or even a few seasons in order to expose your key core group of players to a variety of situations and experiences. Ideally you have some veterans on the team but they do not play very often. *Example: Minnesota Timberwolves*

**Pretenders** (*stolen from Simmons/Grantland*) - This is the category of teams that are not rebuilding but are not quite ready to contend for a championship yet. They routinely make the playoffs and have even made some deep runs but are missing one or two key ingredients for a championship, be it a better coach, a significant role player or even an additional star player. *Example: Washington Wizards*

**No Surprises** - This is for the teams that you would not be surprised if they made the Finals in the same way you would not be surprised if they did not make the Finals. They have all the right pieces and just catch a bad break in the playoffs that prevents them from going all the way. *Example: San Antonion Spurs*

**Contenders** - Obviously the teams that are clear favorites to make the Finals this year. Example: *Golden State Warriors*","Tank, Rebuild, Contend: What are NBA Franchises' Paths to Success? *First and foremost, I do not have an answer to this question, I was hoping that would be the discussion we would have below.*

"Long post incoming, please at least read it before throwing derision at it.

If the past several games have not made it obvious, the Bulls are in basketball hell, no-man’s land.  However, what has also become clear is that “rebuilding”/”retooling” is no longer an option.  That leaves one option—rebuild through the draft, by which tanking gives the best odds of getting a generational player, slim as the chance might be.

Why is retooling no longer an option?  There are a multitude of reasons.

The Bulls will not be able to sign any player who will be able to make a difference to our contending odds.  Before even considering that no in-prime FA has signed in Chicago in the last 2 decades, which makes the following mostly moot, let’s consider who’s available.  Paul/Reddick have verbally agreed to return to LA.  Hayward is either going to the Celtics or staying in Utah.  Curry isn’t leaving, and Durant isn’t coming here.  Porter is an RFA, and WA has said they will match.  The best FA who could conceivably sign with us is George Hill, and he’s not moving the needle from lottery team to contender.  Furthermore, he’s 30, and by the time we could put more around him and Butler, he’d be starting to decline almost certainly.

There are 4 teams currently out of a playoff spot who have a top-20 player in the league, and that’s if you still want to include Melo as a top 20 player, which I most certainly do not.  So, call it 3 of 14 lottery teams with a top-20 player.  One of those is the Wolves, where KAT is still only 21.  Another is the Bulls with Butler.  And the third actually has two, the Pels with Boogie/Davis.

That leaves us with several possibilities.  Try to get two max guys against all odds, like Hill/Porter.  That would leaves us essentially no cap space to sign role-players, and we’d mostly be left with what we have, which for the most part is not impressive.  Well, we just have an example of a team which sacrificed all their young and decent role-players for star talent.  New Orleans is 3-6 since acquiring Boogie, and in the 3 games they won Boogie was suspended for one, so essentially 2-6 since acquiring “star talent”.  In other words, merely getting stars together, unless they are generational ala Lebron, will not produce wins without depth.

Or; we sign a bunch of comparatively cheep shooters to surround Butler with, like Houston did with Harden.  Here’s the problem with that.  Butler only generates 11.1 assist opportunities per game, and only generates 12.1 points off assists.  Those numbers are right around the numbers put up by Reggie Jackson, Sergio Rodriguez, and Dellavedova.  The only players on the entire team who shoots better in Jimmy Butler assist scenarios are Jerian Grant and Christian Felico.  Everyone else shoots drastically better when passed to by any other player than Jimmy Butler.  Those numbers are essentially reversed when dealing with Harden.  Furthermore, this is not a recent development for Harden.  Even before he moved to PG under D’Antoni, **THE WORST SEASON OF HARDEN’S CAREER IN THIS REGARD HE WAS GENERATING 11.5 ASSIST OPPORTUNITIES PER GAME, WHICH IS STILL MORE THAN BUTLER’S CAREER HIGH THIS SEASON.**  Butler does not and it seems like never will have the ability to read defenses and distribute the ball the way Harden does, and we cannot assume that building the same way will be effective because of that.

Or; Butler simply isn’t nearly as good as his numbers indicate, as other top 20 players, outside of those mentioned previously, are set to lead their team into the playoffs, even sometimes kicking and screaming (Westbrook, Paul George, Giannis).

Or, finally; we recognize that Butler is the only player on the team that has any real value, and one of only perhaps 5 players total on the team who have any legitimately real and certain future in the NBA, and that, it being almost impossible to win a ring retooling around him before his prime is gone, we should bite the bullet and trade him for picks, and rebuild from the ground up.

And before you say I don’t trust our FO to rebuild, they have a better history rebuilding through the draft alone than they do through FA, unless you’d like to see more Boozer/Pau/Wade-esque signings, i.e. guys who are way past their prime.
","The Bulls no longer have a choice. They should tank and rebuild. Long post incoming, please at least read it before throwing derision at it.

If the past several games have not made it obvious, the Bulls are in basketball hell, no-man’s land.  However, what has also become clear is that “rebuilding”/”retooling” is no longer an option.  That leaves one option—rebuild through the draft, by which tanking gives the best odds of getting a generational player, slim as the chance might be.

Why is retooling no longer an option?  There are a multitude of reasons.

The Bulls will not be able to sign any player who will be able to make a difference to our contending odds.  Before even considering that no in-prime FA has signed in Chicago in the last 2 decades, which makes the following mostly moot, let’s consider who’s available.

What are the biggest factors in this regression?  Hard to blame it out the schedule when we beat the Warriors but get embarrassed by Detroit and Orlando *(only team with 4th Quarter offensive stats bad enough to rival Chicago's since ASG)*. Fred trying to play a dozen different guys every night is a huge factor, when we enter these 4th quarters​ without a go-to closing lineup

Jimmy individually is playing awful in 4th quarters since All Star weekend, but why? Is he missing the presence Taj Gibson and Doug McDermott gave him in 4th quarters? Chicago isn't playing a stretch against dominant defensive teams. On this four game losing streak, only Detroit has a top ten defense *(9th)*. Teams aren't throwing anything at the Bulls that's unconventional or unfamiliar.

Hoiberg is on the hook for some head scratching rotations, and the constant shuffling of them we're seeing, but Chicago also isn't running anything unfamiliar from a playcalling perspective. Everything seems pretty standard for what we've seen this season but the Bulls are prone to fall into these embarrassing ruts. The Clippers blew our doors off, which might be chalked up to them actually being a good team. When it comes to Detroit, Orlando and Houston though we've thrown away leads in wildly dramatic fashion.

Hoiberg leaves plenty to be desired as a coach, but I don't hold X's & O's playcalling at fault for such huge swings in performance.

"I was catching up on Bill's podcast and heard episode 180 from February 24, right after the deadline. In it he talks about boarding a plane with Gar Forman the day after the Bulls lost to the Warriors 123 to 92. So yeah, that huge blowout were we lost by 31 points to the highest profile team in the entire league.

So this is the beginning of February, with a few weeks to go until the trade deadline. Our team was absolutely trashed by GSW. And Bill says how in this flight, where this motherfucker piece of shit who is supposed to be on the hot seat, who should maybe be thinking about doing his job after his team was embarrassed, who nobody would blame for worrying and working extra hard to assure his team's success and to save his cushy ass job, instead of, I don't know, maybe looking a bit more alert or worried, slept through the whole fucking flight. Like a baby.

I may be overreacting to that tidbit but I think it tells a story of GarPax's mindset. Sure, they are working, but they suck. And that's ok. There's really no pressure to succeed. Jerry Reinsdorf is probably too busy comparing White Sox players' nutsacks to even notice what is happening to ""his"" team.

Fuck this, man. I will not buy one more piece of Bulls merchandise, I will not tune in for a single second to any Bulls game, until they're gone. Fuck this. Read my comments in this sub from before. I can guarantee you the next game we have the Bulls will come out ""on fire"", ""determined"", pull a W out of Hoiberg's ass and then go on another losing streak. Rinse and repeat. We'll hover right outside the playoffs or get bounced the fuck out in the 1st round. We'll draft some more shitty players to join sad sack Mirotic in the All-NBA Disappointment Team. We'll hire some more washed up players to give Jimmy ""options and help"", aka to stand by while Jimmy tries to win games by himself until he can't. Fred will continue to stare blankly at the action on the court. Reinsdorf will continue to not remember he's an NBA team owner. And GarPax will continue to sleep soundly knowing their jobs are safe and there's no worries while they continue to torture us fans.

Fuck this, guys. I am so done. I'm going to enjoy the rest of the season watching good teams play good basketball consistently and bad teams try to improve. Who knows what the fuck Chicago will be doing.","Bill Simmons with an insightful comment about Gar Forman. Shows what state of mind Gar is in.

"Jimmy early in the season was playing out of his mind, but watching games he has fallen off cliff and bulls are having same problems they did last year and are actually a worse team even though they have a shot at the playoffs.

Jimmy last season sharing the role as the man with derrick and pau averaged 

- 21 ppg 45% shooting 31% 3p 5.3 rebounds 4.8 assists 1.6 spg

This season as strictly the man 

- 24 ppg 44% shooting 34% 3p 6.2 rebounds 5.2 assists 1.9 spg

Jimmy has improved stat-wise still hasn't improved as a true leader.  I feel this team can not improve to where fans will be happy unless one of the two happen.

- Jimmy becomes a better ball handler, passer, facilitator with improved court vision.  Jimmy is better as a slasher and iso player, the problem is those skill set players don't typically improve in those areas.

- Bulls some get a true point guard who commands the floor and forces jimmy and other players to play their role and part instead of doing more.","I thought Jimmy would take a bigger leap as the man this year than he did.

The Bulls should have started tanking after All-Star break. I love the Bulls but what is the point of making the playoffs as a 7-8 seed to get bounced out first round when we can just be in the lottery instead? There is so much talent in this draft class having multiple lottery picks could be swapped for a top 5 pick or just two quality lottery players. There is no realistic shot at winning a title this year so why not be ready for a good run next season by loading up in the draft?,[Discussion] What is the point of making the Playoffs?

"Just got back from the United Center, here's some thoughts.  

**Successes**: The shirts were a hit. Had numerous fans coming up to me asking about them and where I got one. Even had a split the pot guy tell me it was an awesome shirt. Seeing the shirts on ESPN for pregame was also totally dope. So the big winner here is the shirts.  

**Failures**: I'll take the blame for it not being organized to perfection. I never thought we would have a massive turnout, I thought we would have 20 people *max* show up to the protest. I saw about 10-12 shirts throughout the concourse which is what I anticipated. We probably should have agreed on a definite time to start chants or a pregame meetup spot. The best part was that a row of junior high schoolers started chanting FIRE GARPAX, which was pretty awesome.  

**Overall**: Was the protest itself a success? I'm not gonna say yes but I'm also not gonna say no. We've gotten a huge amount of publicity about the movement and how fans are upset. Did I realistically think that if the protest worked to 100% perfection that GarPax would get fired the next day? Absolutely not. This is more about the movement. When I made that first post almost a month ago, I never thought anything would catch on. Fast forward to March 4th and we've sold hundreds of shirts, been featured on The Athletic, 670 the Score, the Chicago Tribune, and ESPN (!!!!!!). The Fire GarPax Movement may not be mainstream, but it's gotten people to talk about the front office and pay closer attention to what's going on. Personally, I would consider that a success, whether you agree with the protest or not.  

>**Lastly, a huge thank you to everyone who bought shirts or tickets or wanted to spread the word. Watching this thing grow has been so incredible and I'll forever love y'all here on Reddit. Shoutout to the mods for all the help planning and helping out with ideas and all that fun stuff. You guys are some of the best on all of Reddit**

"Can someone explain how anyone who claims to be a Bulls fan at any point between 2003-2016 actually likes Dwyane Wade?

- flops (see: 2006 finals), which he has happily brought [here to Chicago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6F508vF7o8)

- doesn't practice

- then proceeds to complain about the younger players' effort

- then shows up a teammate for preventing him from stat padding into a triple double

- nicknamed himself ""3""

"I don't know what discussion has been had on this here, but I wrote this up for a facebook group of friends I'm in and figured I'd post it on here as well.

There's no need for a full rebuild, in my opinion. Looking at all the salaries coming off the books, we can easily re-tool around Jimmy with solid young-ish players.  

We have five players coming off the books and maybe two more. Nikola Mirotic, Anthony Morrow, Michael Carter-Williams, Joffrey Lauvergne, and Cristiano Felicio are all free agents at the end of the season. Wade has a $23.8M player option and Rondo has a $13.4M team option.

The likelihood of us declining Rondo's option is high and Wade may decline his and go somewhere else or sign for cheaper to give us some more money to add talent. Let's assume those two options get declined.

That means we have these players under contract (player options denoted by \*):  
Jimmy Butler - $18.7M  
Robin Lopez - $13.79M  
Cameron Payne - $2.2M\*  
Denzel Valentine - $2.19M  
Jerian Grant - $1.71M\*  
Bobby Portis - $1.52M\*  
Isaiah Canaan - $1.09M\*  
Paul Zipser - $905K  

The only of those player options I can see us declining is Canaan's, given that we have Payne and Grant to rotate at PG.

The total salary number for those players (including Canaan) is $42.1M. The salary cap for the 2017-2018 season is $102M, meaning we have about $60M in cap space, with another $20M of luxury tax room.

Now, ideally, Wade declines his option and either re-signs for cheaper ($10-15M range) or goes somewhere else, but if he accepts his option, we'll still have $36M in space, plus the $20M in luxury room.

Here's a list of all of the players not currently under contract for next season that I could envision the Bulls front office making house calls on: Tim Hardaway\*, Tyreke Evans, Ben McLemore\*, Derrick Rose, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope\*, Serge Ibaka, Patrick Patterson, Alex Len\*, Andre Roberson\*, Shabazz Muhammad\*, Otto Porter\* (\*=RFA)

And here's a list of players with player options for next season that I could imagine declining to go elsewhere: Greg Monroe, Blake Griffin, Chris Paul, Paul Millsap, Gordon Hayward, Rudy Gay

It's not exactly a great year to have this much cap room but there are some solid players out there we could sign for fairly cheap and leave room for next season if we choose.

It's also fun to fantasize about CP3 and Blake declining their options and coming to team up with Jimmy in Chicago lol. 

Realistically, though, I could see us going after Ibaka and Roberson/KCP. Ibaka would fit well with Jimmy, I think. I doubt Detroit lets KCP walk.. they'll probably match. Roberson would be a nice defensive addition alongside Jimmy on the wings, if Wade leaves. A starting lineup of Grant, Roberson, Jimmy, Ibaka, and Lopez would be fun and very tough to score on, I think. The offense.. not so much lol. Also depends on which of our current players we decide to re-sign.

But hope is not all lost for the Bulls. Obviously, none of us have much faith in Garpax, and for good reason. Hopefully, they can accomplish something this off-season, or get canned and the new guy can. I'm not giving up hope for the future, and neither should you!","Investigation into the Cap Situation for Next Season I don't know what discussion has been had on this here, but I wrote this up for a facebook group of friends I'm in and figured I'd post it on here as well.

Am I the only one who thinks that Grant has really improved his play over the last 10-15 games. He's shooting the 3 with confidence and playing fairly aggressively IMO. Now Payne is being placed into the rotation and taking minutes that Grant would normally get. I wasn't very impressed with Payne in OKC and his 2 games in Chicago haven't done much to change my opinion. I feel like the Bulls are risking hurting Grants development by forcing Payne into the rotation at this point.

"So, like most people, after the Boogie trade, I had little hope for getting the Kings pick this year before it conveys into 2nd rounders next year. However, things are going slightly unexpected and, at this point, it is looking possible that the Bulls get the pick. Currently, if the lottery plays out by the odds, the Kings are slated to get the 11th pick which is literally best case scenario for us. Having the 11th and our 17th-ish pick (assuming we still make the playoffs - if not, even better) in a deep draft is an ideal situation. However, the Kings are only 2 games out of the playoffs which is also good for us because the pick may not be as good but we will be sure to get it if they do end up getting the 8th seed. Their chances of making it are looking good considering the Trailblazers and Pelicans have been struggling.

Low usage rate and can play off-ball with Jimmy. And I know people are concerned with his age. But it's only his 10th season, and his game has never relied on his athleticism so i think it'll age really well ala Chris Paul.

Luis Scola is shooting 40% last year(with the Raps) and is making almost one three pointer(0.9/2.1) per game for them. He can also score in the post. He always run in fast breaks. He sets good screens. Though he is slow, his defense is still very good. Especially on the pick in rolls, where he knows how to trap the guard.

&nbsp;


With the departure of Taj Gibson, Scola could very well fit in with the Bulls starters. But it will push Portis development back.

&nbsp;

Are the Bulls looking at him?

I want him to start for our playoffs push.

"How am I a Bulls and 49ers fan? Grew up in the Bay Area watching the 49ers on TV (Raiders were still in LA, blacked out on TV when here) and I took a trip to Chicago as a young kid in 1996 with all the championship attention and it stuck with me. As I look at Taj Gibson being the final member of the 2010-11 team to leave, I got to thinking about this.

Both teams had a dynasty followed by a near decade of mostly poor play (Bulls from 1998-2006, 49ers from 2003-2010).

Face of the franchise had knee issues (Rose, Frank Gore in college)

Biggest names left near the same time (Ben Gordon from 2004-2009, Alex Smith from 2004-2011)

Both teams took their next step at around the same same (2010-2011) and had a short yet successful 3 year run of deep playoff runs, yet the 49ers at least reached a Super Bowl. 

Both teams have front offices that, during their successful runs, were mostly lauded for their greatness, to become complete laughingstocks a few years later. 49ers GM Trent Baalke and Bulls GM Gar Forman won Executive of the Year awards in the same year 2011

Both fanbases despise the owner.

Both teams had great coaches (Harbaugh and Thibodeau) that got forced out by the front office and in their place were put mediocre replacements.

Both teams had some of their biggest names go through major injury issues (Bulls with Rose and Noah, 49ers with Patrick Willis, Navorro Bowman) before leaving, a big lack of respect for their biggest names (Rose called the worst MVP in a long time, Kaepernick told his contract was a joke), and controversy with their biggest stars (Rose with his comments to the media about wanting to leave, Kaepernick recently with his anthem protest)

Then you have basically everyone from the Bulls in 2010 now finally being gone, and how the 49ers had mass free agency departures and retirements so their team now looks nothing like the championship-contending teams from then.

Even the red and occasionally white/black color schemes (49ers alternate jerseys are black with red numbers) are similar.

Sorry if this is a shitpost, but just something I felt needed to be shared.","As a Chicago Bulls and San Francisco 49ers fan, the parallels between the two teams (both good and bad) amazes me How am I a Bulls and 49ers fan?

Both teams had a dynasty followed by a near decade of mostly poor play (Bulls from 1998-2006, 49ers from 2003-2010).

Face of the franchise had knee issues (Rose, Frank Gore in college)

Biggest names left near the same time (Ben Gordon from 2004-2009, Alex Smith from 2004-2011)

Both teams took their next step at around the same same (2010-2011) and had a short yet successful 3 year run of deep playoff runs, yet the 49ers at least reached a Super Bowl. 

Both teams have front offices that, during their successful runs, were mostly lauded for their greatness, to become complete laughingstocks a few years later. 49ers GM Trent Baalke and Bulls GM Gar Forman won Executive of the Year awards in the same year 2011

Both fanbases despise the owner.

Both teams had great coaches (Harbaugh and Thibodeau) that got forced out by the front office and in their place were put mediocre replacements.

Both teams had some of their biggest names go through major injury issues (Bulls with Rose and Noah, 49ers with Patrick Willis, Navorro Bowman) before leaving, a big lack of respect for their biggest names (Rose called the worst MVP in a long time, Kaepernick told his contract was a joke), and controversy with their biggest stars (Rose with his comments to the media about wanting to leave, Kaepernick recently with his anthem protest)

Then you have basically everyone from the Bulls in 2010 now finally being gone, and how the 49ers had mass free agency departures and retirements so their team now looks nothing like the championship-contending teams from then.

Even the red and occasionally white/black color schemes (49ers alternate jerseys are black with red numbers) are similar.

"Honestly, one of the hardest parts of being a fan of both is knowing that Jerry Reinsdorf is the owner.

Given his age, Jerry has been in ""win now"" mode for the past 10 years or so. For the Sox, this has meant signing aging players way past their prime, with the hope that they can magically regain their youthful vigor.

In a recent interview, the White Sox GM, Rick Hahn, made it very clear that the decision to rebuild is/was most difficult for Reinsdorf to swallow, as he consistently reminds them how old he is getting.

It's a shame that the overall health of both franchises are tightly wound to one man's desire to ""win now,"" while never actually accomplishing that feat.

I'm hoping that the Bulls, similar to the Sox, pull a complete rebuild and trade off Butler - similar to Chris Sale of the White Sox. 

It's time to get back to being perennial contenders and that is going to take a strong nucleus of young talent.

"#Here is what I thought Bulls addressed in the OKC trade.


**First, they strengthen their playoffs chase by adding another PG and a consistent three point threat.**



**Second, they added a cheap quality PG who they can build around Jimmy Butler.**

&nbsp;

We all love Taj and Doug, but it's not our business to run.


Taj is going to get paid and Doug isn't helping us now(with his inconsistency and defense) or in the future(his going to get paid two years from now).


And this brought us to why the trade happened.

&nbsp;

**Addition by subtraction**


We all know Bulls ain't paying Taj, so why give him the minutes of Felicio(who himself is on the verge of breaking out).


Trading Taj and Doug will open up more minutes for Felicio and Paul Zipser. Two non first rounders who come out as a surprise this season. On top of that, it also opened up playing time for Zel, Bobby and Niko. Players who deserve(maybe not Niko) as chance to prove themselves. 
 
&nbsp;

**Cameron Payne**


Fred Hoiberg juggled the PG starters for four months now and nobody seems to be a fit with the starters. Payne is the only tradition point guard that Bulls could keep, as Rondo and MCW are most likely gone after this season. Like Grant, Payne is on rookie scale for the next two season. But Grant is more of a shooting guard with his shoot first mentality. Payne is a solid defender(20th in defensive RPM among point guards) that can work on his shot(shot 38% in college). Being just 22 years old and on a cheap rookie contract, Payne has all the time he need to turn himself into a consistent spot shooter, playing along side Jimmy Butler. If this turns out what we all hoped for, maybe we can finally have a 3&D PG who can run a team.

&nbsp;

**Anthony Morrow**


Anthony Morrow basically provides us with a consistent shooter on the court. A glaring weakness with Niko and Doug failing to consistently space the floor. We have now a rotation player who can space the floor for Butler and Wade. I expect him to have a big impact on Bulls playoffs push.","Bulls playoffs push and building around Jimmy Butler. #Here is what I thought Bulls addressed in the OKC trade.

We didn't save money on the trade so you can't argue that it did anything except lock in Robin Lopez in a good contract (which need I remind you does absolutely nothing). Ok that happened. Now we get younger and athletic right? Nope we sign Wade and Rondo. Why? You literally just fucked over Thibs and signed Hoiberg and then you give him the exact opposite of the tools that he needs to succeed as a head coach, gee, makes perfect sense to me. Good luck fred, heres a slow paced, non fastbreak, non-pushed tempo, non shooting offense. Good luck out there! 

So now they think Wade Rondo and Jimmy is a big three. So either they don't know anything about basketball, or they just wanted to attract people to big names and put butts in the seats, fuck them.

Fast forward, it doesn't work out, What a shocker. So they decide to ""blow it up"". Nerlens Noel gets scooped up for Bogut and Justin Anderson. Who? We couldn't have got him for Taj and anyone cuz who is Justin Anderson. From what I read we didn't close a Jimmy Butler deal because we wanted players and not picks? WHAT? Why do we need players, if your trading Jimmy what the fuck are you going to do with players, build around Wade who is 74? 

We end up trading Taj and Doug for three bench players AND the cherry on top we manage to trade a pick for them as well? So we wasted 6 picks on Doug. HE NEVER EVEN GOT A CHANCE. Doug is not the next Gordon Hayward but he can shoot the shit out of the ball. If Korver can succeed why cant he? Ill tell you why, its because he stands in the fucking corner the whole game, doesn't get enough plays ran for him. If you have an elite shooter he should be shooting 10 threes a game,  minimum.

"I wish Gibson and McDermott the best, but the Thunder are the 7 seed in the West with a less than 1% chance of winning the title, and I don't see that changing much because of this trade.  Maybe if Taj is a great fit they can move up to the 6 seed and a 1% chance of winning the title?  And then he becomes a free agent.

For the Bulls, this is all about Payne, and he has a chance of becoming a rotation player -- a better chance than McDermott, if you ask me.

I would just like to say that Cam Payne is not as bad as he seems. He had an injury this year and showed a lot of promise last year.

Butler's career trajectory is like no other (I'd put the stats but you all know them). He has gotten better every single year. We didn't think he could get better last year, and he gifted us with this season's Top 10 performance. 

I think this is one situation where, although it sounds crazy, we should actually consider our 27 year old all star starter for his UPSIDE. 

He has slowly fixed each part of his game, and I think it's fair to assume that he may even improve upon this season too!

"I've seen around here for years it seems like this idea that ""suddenly"" we draft poorly because Matt Lloyd is gone. (He was let go in 2012).

I was curious to see, is this true or honestly just coincidence?

In reference to this tweet: https://twitter.com/TheAthleticChi/status/834112981109661696

We can see that we had a string of 4 years with VAST overachievers while prior to that it was hit or miss each year.

Then in the last 4 years we have had just poor success. But based on that report, it's unreasonable to expect much from those players, and a few still have chances to meet the low, low expectations.

So, is Matt Lloyd a genius? Or did we just get lucky and now we're falling to the norm?

Check out this chart: http://www.82games.com/nbadraftpicks.htm

By multiplying the probabilities, there was a 40% chance that NONE of our 4 picks over the last 4 years would turn into anything more than a role players. That's barely below a coin flip. 

There was a 17.5% chance all 4 turned into BUSTS. What happened so far is well within the realm of ordinary odds with 3/4 picks being 20 and up. 

Even with Doug at 11, 30% chance he becomes an all star/solid player. 30% role player. 40% deep bench or bust.

But what about Matt Lloyd?

Here's the Magic draft picks since hiring him:

2012 -1/19: Andrew Nicholson (Notable misses Fournier, Crowder, Green, Middleton)

2013 -1/2: Victor Oladipo. Decent pick. Arguable that there were better choices.

2014 -1/4 and 1/9: Aaron Gordon and Elfrid Payton. Not bad but not some genius either.

2015 -1/5: Hezonja. Okay pick, still not a steal.

95% chance that one of those picks turned into an all-star. 95%.

3 of those picks had a 60% all-star probability. Hezonja is probably the best bet at this point.

"Hey, Bulls fans.  How's it going. You're all looking very handsome/pretty today.  Oh, this old thing? I've had it for years.  Anyway, let's get down to business.

I'm a Knicks fan suffering through another frustrating season and my time on the Knicks subreddit has been marred by a new phenomenon.  Derrick Rose fans have flooded our subreddit since the start of the season. They clearly don't care about the Knicks, they just follow a player.  And this has led to some arguments.  Very unusual for Reddit, I know.  

Now, we don't need to debate Rose here, though I'm happy to .  I think he, at this point, is a 6th man scorer off the bench type. He's not very effecient, he doesn't get to the line, he can't shoot 3s, he's a bad facilitator (for us at least) and he's been a very bad defender for us. He has a bad habit of drawing help defenders but then ignoring the open man. Usually porzingis. I can provide some numbers on all these claims upon request, but that debate isn't why I'm writing this. I'm writing it to ask a question:

Why are Rose fans so fanatical about the guy?  I never say anything on our sub about him personally. I never leave out the fact that the Knicks around him also suck.  I just point out the flaws in his game and back it up with stats and the eye test.  But this never leads to a productive discussion. Instead, these fans go crazy in defending Rose, bash the Knicks as an answer for all of his flaws and literally refuse evidence.  In an r/NBA thread I posted a bunch of stats to back up my opinion after being told I didn't have stats to back up my opinion. Then the Rose fan replied that the stats didn't tell him anything new and he just disagreed because he knows Rose should be a starter for half the league.  No counter argument. No stats. No eye test, even. Just, ""he knows.""  I feel like I've been arguing religion with a bunch of cult members.  

Can anyone here help a poor, confused Knicks fan understand the cult?  Why does this guy make people abandon all reason and refuse to just talk about what's happening on the court? 


edit: I should add that I remember his MVP season. I know he was great. I loved watching him. I'm not a new NBA fan. I'm curious about the attitude of Rose fans in 2017.

Derrick Rose fans have flooded our subreddit since the start of the season. They clearly don't care about the Knicks, they just follow a player.  And this has led to some arguments.  Very unusual for Reddit, I know.  

Now, we don't need to debate Rose here, though I'm happy to .  I think he, at this point, is a 6th man scorer off the bench type. He's not very effecient, he doesn't get to the line, he can't shoot 3s, he's a bad facilitator (for us at least) and he's been a very bad defender for us. He has a bad habit of drawing help defenders but then ignoring the open man. Usually porzingis. I can provide some numbers on all these claims upon request, but that debate isn't why I'm writing this. I'm writing it to ask a question:

Why are Rose fans so fanatical about the guy?  I never say anything on our sub about him personally. I never leave out the fact that the Knicks around him also suck.  I just point out the flaws in his game and back it up with stats and the eye test.  But this never leads to a productive discussion. Instead, these fans go crazy in defending Rose, bash the Knicks as an answer for all of his flaws and literally refuse evidence.  In an r/NBA thread I posted a bunch of stats to back up my opinion after being told I didn't have stats to back up my opinion. Then the Rose fan replied that the stats didn't tell him anything new and he just disagreed because he knows Rose should be a starter for half the league.  No counter argument. No stats. No eye test, even. Just, ""he knows.""  I feel like I've been arguing religion with a bunch of cult members.  

Can anyone here help a poor, confused Knicks fan understand the cult?  Why does this guy make people abandon all reason and refuse to just talk about what's happening on the court? 


edit: I should add that I remember his MVP season. I know he was great. I loved watching him. I'm not a new NBA fan. I'm curious about the attitude of Rose fans in 2017.

His value is reduced because he is having a down year, but a lot of that can be attributed to his injury.  His January was really good, but his season averages are still being dragged down by his slow return (that being said his Feb has been bad so far and I don't know what the reason for that is).  But he is locked in for several more years in a reasonable salary for a starting pg, and would make a good second scorer beside Jimmy.  Most importantly, he would give us our first starting caliber PG that can actually shoot a 3 point shot at an acceptable level since Kirk was in his prime.  

We would need to include Niko and Taj or Rondo to make the salaries work, any of which would provide the Pistons with the cap flexibility moving forward that they are looking for.  They would obviously prefer Taj who they could then flip.  Then make the actual value match with picks.  So I would offer Niko, Taj and a future 1st or Niko, Rondo and our 2017 first.  Jackson is a bit of a gamble, but he has huge upside and his value is currently low so it is a good time to buy.

"Is it crazy to think that the Bulls will never actually tear it down fully if the White Sox are in the midst of a rebuild? Part of me thinks that the Bulls are bankrolling the White Sox' rebuild...If Jerry strips down the Bulls, the ticket prices would probably have to be reduced, the UC would be far from packed every night, and apparel sales would drop, among other financial repercussions. Despite the Bulls being mediocre, they still have some of the highest ticket/concession prices in the league, and make Jerry Reinsdorf buckets of cash.  

Since Jerry is taking a bath on the White Sox for the foreseeable future, I can't really foresee him tearing down the bulls and further reducing his profits. Jerry is many things, but is first and foremost a businessman. I have long thought it's a risky proposition to own 2 sports teams in the same town and I might be slightly conspiracy theorist here but it seems plausible to me. Anyone else share these thoughts?

"**ATTN:** Sup everyone. I'm back with some more info about the protest. I've gotten a lot of PMs lately about whats going down and more stuff about seats and shirts so I'll try and clear everything up.  
  

**Shirts:** If you've been following along with the last update, the original shirts got taken down. The second version of the shirt that just said Fire GarPax on them without the Bulls Reddit logo was also taken down. If you ordered one before they were taken down it should have shipped by now and there shouldn't be any issues with that. Only problem is that we cant make any more of them. I have the templates for both shirts so if anyone wants to make them on their own, just PM me and you can get the template.    


**Tickets/Seats:** The game is still the March 4th Nationally Televised game vs the Clippers. I've fielded a lot of questions about where everyone will be sitting and if there is a dedicated section for protestors. There isn't a dedicated section but I've been telling people to buy seats between sections 304-314. Its the side of the 300 level that has the Bulls' bench. If you've already bought tickets or end up doing so, send me a PM so I can get a headcount and determine a pregame meetup spot.  


Thanks again for all the support! More updates to come in the near future.

"Fred is awful. It seems like every play we run comes down to either Jimmy Iso-ing, Wade fading away (which I get is his play style, but come on), or a contested three pointer by Niko that flies off the backboard.

BUTTT I live in Charlotte where the bulls happen to be coming in about a month and will be proudly protesting! If there's any other Bulls in Charlotte hit me up and we can organize.

"### Attention r/chicagobulls

The amount of support we have received has been absolutely incredible. Seeing things on Bleacher Report and Twitter has not only been overwhelming but just so so so cool. The moderators and I are also involved with different press avenues like TheAthletic and Blogabull about this protest and how we're planning it.

Some other Redditors are currently working on details as well so just hang tight for a bit so we'll keep you in the loop once everything is locked a 100%.

- [We also had a shirt design set up so you guys can start purchasing them](https://represent.com/rcb-protest-tee)

Again, I'd like to thank you all so very much for all your support and help. This is so amazing!

### A reminder of what the plan is
* March 4th game against the Clippers @ 7:30
* If you can, buy one of the T-shirts! They will go a long way in helping our cause
* We will chant until we no longer have voices!

"I'm currently watching the Thunder-Cavs game and it looks like it's going to be a good one. Right at this moment Cameron Payne is killing it and this thought occurred to me:

A few years ago Boston had its pick of college coaches, selected Brad Stevens and then he followed up by developing their young players and turned their franchise around rather quickly.

Two years ago OKC had its pick of college coaches and decided to go with Billy Donovan. Since then, they've lost their #1 star but seems to be developing their young talent and is making a sooner than expected push for the playoffs.

So where I'm stuck at is, What happened with us? We had our pick of college coaches and made our choice but we don't seem to be heading in the right direction at all. Granted we don't have a RW but still neither did BOS, and we do have arguably a top 10 player. I watch those other two teams and while they aren't winning a chip this they are still a lot of fun to watch. I don't feel that way about my team as much I wish.","Why not our coach?

"It's been really awesome seeing all of the support for the GarPax protest. Obviously there is a lot of ways we could do this and seeing everyone's suggestions in the comments of the original post has been super helpful. With that being said, I've made a LOOSE plan of what could possibly work for our protest. 

Game: March 4th vs. Clippers, nationally televised on ABC

Shirts?: So I have a custom shirt designed that is Neon Yellow with red lettering that just says FIRE GARPAX on it. We won't be able to get in to the UC wearing those so we could all wear hoodies or jackets over them and when the game starts we pull them off. If people were interested in buying them I can start a CustomInk order form. If the FIRE GARPAX shirts aren't your thing I think just neon yellow shirts to fill up a section would turn some heads and get some exposure. One of the mods also desgned a super good looking shirt and its linked below.


T-Shirt link: http://i.imgur.com/6GDwPZm.jpg (designed by u/alba7or)

Seats: With this being a nationally televised game vs a team like the Clippers, tickets aren't gonna be cheap. So what we could do is try and fill up some of cheap seats in the 300 level behind the baskets. Sections 304-314 would be ideal. If there was a bunch of angry fans in the upper deck wearing neon yellow shirts and screaming FIRE GARPAX, Bulls execs wouldn't be able to ignore it.

Alternate Games: Other games that could work would be Saturday March 18 vs Utah or Saturday April 1 vs Atlanta. The reason I'm saying this is due to high ticket prices for the Clippers game. If people want to save money either of those games could work. Only disadvantage would be no national TV exposure.

Feel free to leave any more suggestions as we start to solidfy this protest! Thanks for all the support and Go Bulls!

"Hey everyone,

The Bulls play the Suns this Friday in downtown Phoenix. They only come once a year, and I can't make it. It is too late to sell them, but I didn't want to anyway. In previous times in my life, I've enjoyed being a Bulls fan thanks to an overwhelming amount of generosity from friends and family. I check this subreddit each day. I know this has been a rough year for the team. Things haven't been going so well for me personally either. The only thing that would make me feel better is if two people would like to attend the game in my stead. I didn't want to post this to /r/suns, but I will if nobody is interested. I'll meet you in downtown Phoenix and give them to you for nothing.  My only request is that you do not resell them.

Thank you for reading... go Bulls!

Edit: A home for the tickets has been found. Thanks so much for your replies and positive responses!

","Two free tickets to see the Bulls in Phoenix Hey everyone,

The Bulls play the Suns this Friday in downtown Phoenix. They only come once a year, and I can't make it. It is too late to sell them, but I didn't want to anyway. In previous times in my life, I've enjoyed being a Bulls fan thanks to an overwhelming amount of generosity from friends and family. I check this subreddit each day. I know this has been a rough year for the team. Things haven't been going so well for me personally either. The only thing that would make me feel better is if two people would like to attend the game in my stead. I didn't want to post this to /r/suns, but I will if nobody is interested. I'll meet you in downtown Phoenix and give them to you for nothing.  My only request is that you do not resell them.

Thank you for reading... go Bulls!

Edit: A home for the tickets has been found. Thanks so much for your replies and positive responses!

"Bulls get: Carmelo Anthony

Knicks get: Taj Gibson, Rajon Rondo, and CHI '17 first-round pick

Who says no and why?

Bulls would be in a position to make noise in the playoffs this year while avoiding having to overpay Taj and also having a very real chance to convince CP3 to come join his buddies Wade, Melo, and Jimmy in Chicago.

The Knicks would rid themselves of Melo, gain cap space via the expiring Taj Gibson contract, get a PG for when D-Rose leaves, and get a first-round pick for their rebuild.

Bulls would be left with:

Grant/MCW

Wade/Valentine/Canaan

Butler/Zipser/McDermott

Melo/Mirotic/Portis

Lopez/Felicio

And if things went their way next year, they could end up with a crazy-good roster (if they can convince CP3 to join and/or if they get the SAC pick:

"What do you guys think?  Who says no and why?  

I think Thibs would love to have Jimmy back and obviously Jimmy is the far superior player right now.  He'd help take some pressure off Thibs and that team from the fans by helping them actually win some now.  Plus, they'd get the guy who is guaranteed, 100%, already what they hope Wiggins can be someday.

The Bulls could actually get younger and more athletic and maybe Wiggins is a guy that the FO feels comfortable building around if they don't feel that way about Jimmy.  It'd make the team worse right now in the hopes that it'd make them better in the long run.

The trade may also work from a coaching perspective.  Thibs loves Jimmy and Jimmy wants that hard coaching.  You can tell he respects Thibs a lot more than Hoiberg.  Hoiberg (whose odds of staying here beyond this season went up with that report that GarPax aren't going anywhere) would probably prefer and work better with the younger and less demanding Wiggins.  It would allow them to grow together.","Butler for Wiggins? What do you guys think?  Who says no and why?

"I've noticed that we've had a lot of discussions between our sub and the Celtics sub regarding what would be a fair trade for Jimmy Butler. If the Bulls decide to blow the whole thing up by trading Jimmy and tanking another possibility as a trade partner could be the Nuggets. I posted on their sub asking what a fair trade would be and the conclusion most people came to was something like three players and two first round picks. It would be something like:

Nuggets receive: Jimmy Butler

Bulls receive: Jusuf Nurkic, Gary Harris, Malik Beasley, Denver 2017 1st round pick, Memphis 2017 1st round pick

This trade would give us three first round picks in a deep draft (four if the Kings pick conveys) and some more shooting/young guys.

These are things GarPaxDorf are dying to prevent.


They can't manipulate their players anymore. And that means, they can't buy them cheap.


They need a Scottie(whom they low balled contract wise) as much as they need a MJ.


And Jimmy are polluting the minds of the young lads. Making them wiser.

I would expect them to shop Butler for Fultz this coming draft.


Then maybe convince Rondo to stay and play off the bench. Since his not getting a bigger pay outside Chicago.


I can easily see Niko being included in the trade with Jimmy to land Fultz. 


If ever we land Fultz, Bulls do have options for rebuild.


Boston can't afford to over pay Kelly Olynyk... But we do!


There is also Greg Monroe and DMo. James Young could be had.


I tell you, I will throw max on Olynyk just to get him off Boston. His going to be worth the money if his playing with Fultz.


Olynyk and Fultz would make a great pick-and-pop partners.


Then maybe sign DMo and play him off the bench, since he is likely going to be cheap.


S: Fultz, Zel, Zipser, Olynyk and RoLo


B: Rondo, Grant, Doug, Felicio and Portis


It would be easier if Boston gets the #1 pick though.

Boston can't afford to over pay Kelly Olynyk... But we do!


There is also Greg Monroe and DMo. James Young could be had.


I tell you, I will throw max on Olynyk just to get him off Boston. His going to be worth the money if his playing with Fultz.


Olynyk and Fultz would make a great pick-and-pop partners.


Then maybe sign DMo and play him off the bench, since he is likely going to be cheap.


S: Fultz, Zel, Zipser, Olynyk and RoLo


B: Rondo, Grant, Doug, Felicio and Portis


It would be easier if Boston gets the #1 pick though.


Fultz, Olynyk and other tradeables for Jimmy and Niko and maybe some picks?


B: Rondo(if he is still around) or Grant, ",20,0,I see a rebuild coming...,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/5rjhq6/i_see_a_rebuild_coming/

"Breaking this down by month starting from November.

November: Rank 30th, Point Differential - 15.5

December: Rank 25th, Point Differential - 5.8

January (Rondo in 6th man role): Rank 2nd, Point Differential +14.3.

That's a 20 point differential swing from our bench since moving Rondo to that role, and we have the 2nd best bench in the NBA in January.

Why? 

We increase our PPG off the bench by 10, and went from an abysmal 3.8 assists per game to 8.1. Rondo gets the ball moving off the bench.

Additionally we see 1.1 more steals per game.

Cut down 1.0 Turnovers.

Increase our FG% by 4%.

And... Increase our 3 point shots from 28% and 3.1 per game, to 36% and 4.5 per game, the 4th most bench 3s per game in the NBA.

In conclusion. I truly believe that if we kept our bench lineup in it's current form, it would be worth picking up Rondo's option next year to keep him in this role. It can solidify us as having one of the best benches in the league, and it may only cost about 30M total to keep it that way.

"Bulls get: Avery Bradley, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, and the Nets' 2017 unprotected first-round pick

Celtics get: Jimmy Butler

Who says no and why?

If the Bulls really feel like Jimmy isn't he guy to build around, the the Celtics are by far the most logical/likely trade partner.  This would be a pretty good haul for the Bulls and in addition, would make them worse.  That would improve the value of their own draft pick and probably cause D-Wade to move on after this season which would free up a ton of cap space.  Bradley's a 26-year-old defensive stud who can play either guard position.  Jaylen Brown is still only 20 and was the #3 overall draft pick this past season.  Smart's still only 22 and was the #6 overall pick back in 2014.  And of course, that Nets pick is very likely to be the #1 overall pick in this upcoming draft.

The Celtics would get the piece that puts them over the top and places them in direct competition with the Cavs for Eastern Conference supremacy.  They'd be set up to have a shot at the Finals for a few years straight.

The Bulls would be left with:

Smart/Rondo/Grant/MCW

Bradley/Wade/Valentine/Canaan

McDermott/Brown/Zipser

Gibson/Mirotic/Portis

Lopez/Felicio

That's 16 guys, so they'd have to move at least one of their guys to make that work.

Looking forward to next season, they could very well be setup to roll out a roster looking something like:

Markelle Fultz/Smart/Grant/MCW

Bradley/Valentine/Canaan

McDermott/Brown/Zipser

Mirotic/Harry Giles/Portis

Lopez/Felicio

So what do you think?  Who wins the trade?  Why should we do it?  Why not?","Jimmy Butler Trade Idea (with BOS) Bulls get: Avery Bradley, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, and the Nets' 2017 unprotected first-round pick

If the Bulls really feel like Jimmy isn't he guy to build around, the the Celtics are by far the most logical/likely trade partner.  This would be a pretty good haul for the Bulls and in addition, would make them worse.  That would improve the value of their own draft pick and probably cause D-Wade to move on after this season which would free up a ton of cap space.  Bradley's a 26-year-old defensive stud who can play either guard position.  Jaylen Brown is still only 20 and was the #3 overall draft pick this past season.  Smart's still only 22 and was the #6 overall pick back in 2014.  And of course, that Nets pick is very likely to be the #1 overall pick in this upcoming draft.

The Celtics would get the piece that puts them over the top and places them in direct competition with the Cavs for Eastern Conference supremacy.  They'd be set up to have a shot at the Finals for a few years straight.

The Bulls would be left with:

Smart/Rondo/Grant/MCW

Bradley/Wade/Valentine/Canaan

McDermott/Brown/Zipser

Gibson/Mirotic/Portis

Lopez/Felicio

That's 16 guys, so they'd have to move at least one of their guys to make that work.

Looking forward to next season, they could very well be setup to roll out a roster looking something like:

Markelle Fultz/Smart/Grant/MCW

Bradley/Valentine/Canaan

McDermott/Brown/Zipser

Mirotic/Harry Giles/Portis

Lopez/Felicio

This could be a potential win-win trade even though I love Taj.  The Bulls get younger and avoid having to either overpay to keep Taj or let him go for nothing.  They get two talented young guys (Sully's 24 and Powell's 23) and the Raptors get the piece they need to really challenge CLE for a shot at the Finals.

"First off, before reading this, know that I love this team. I love Jimmy and what he has done in terms of his career trajectory is nothing short of incredible. However, this year is near the peak of where Jimmy is going to be. With Jimmy at his peak, we are still just fighting for the 7-8 seed with a good chance of missing the playoffs. I believe the plan with brining in Wade this year was to lure Chris Paul here this upcoming summer, but even then, I don’t think that would make us title contenders with the rest of our roster and the other teams in the league right now.


**Step 1: Trade Jimmy for Jaylen Brown and the Nets pick**

Obviously, our biggest asset right now is Jimmy. His leadership qualities should be in question and his constant undermining of Hoiberg cannot be helping the team overall. There are a few teams that he could be added to that would immediately make them contenders. My personal favorite is the Boston Celtics. They have an almost guaranteed top 3 pick and with the way IT is playing, adding Jimmy would put them in immediate contention with the Cavs. 

http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=zx3ykxd

Jaylen Brown is a young, emerging prospect, but is still far from being a true contributor to a championship caliber team. Avery Bradley would be my preferred option to make this pick work, but also Terry Rozier’s salary would also make the salary caps work. I would even be okay with adding Taj to the deal to improve the Celtics’ woes with rebounding. With this in place…

**Step 2: Trust the tank**

Naturally after trading Jimmy, our record is going to plummet. He has been carrying this team on his back for the entire season and with him gone we might even be worse than the 76ers from previous years (but damn are they fun to watch now). We currently have 23 wins. There are 14 teams with their 1st round draft picks below us (including the Kings). With the lineup after the trade, I could see us win 8- 10 of the remaining 34 games. Using last year’s NBA season results as a reference, if we finish at around 34 wins, that would put us around the 8-10 spot. Now this results in us with 2 top 10 picks to work with. If we wanted to take this even further, we could trade a player like Niko for pile of rocks to Sacramento to hope to god that they get better but that would probably not happen, and let’s be honest, Niko probably wouldn’t help the Kings too much.

**Step 3: Draft Night**

We should be coming into Draft Night with two top ten picks and if we’re lucky, the Kings pick at number 11. I absolutely love this draft class and after watching most of these top players, I truly believe it will go down as a historically great draft. I won’t go into depth on these guys since this isn’t a true draft prospect post but I encourage you to watch these guys play! Also lots of different sites have different rankings for these guys so it might be different from ones you’ve seen but I’m using an aggregate from multiple mocks from different sites.

With the first pick (1-3): Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, Dennis Smith

Second pick (8-10): Malik Monk, Jayson Taytum, Jonathon Isaac

Kings pick (unlikely): Justin Patton (Go Jays), Harry Giles (question mark with him but he’s a Chicago kid and his upside is huge still)

**2017 Season and on…**

With all of this taking place, our starting lineup would be:

PG: **Fultz, Ball, or Smith**

SG: Wade (Valentine if Wade leaves)

SF/PF: **Brown/ Monk, Taytum, or Isaac**

C: Rolo (possible Patton or Giles- more of a PF but oh well for now)


Granted this team would take some serious time to develop and grow, and we’d probably be in the lottery for the next two years. But we as fans would get to watch a lineup with Jaylen Brown, two top ten picks, and possibly a top 15 grow and develop with each other. This would also put us in a timeframe where LeBron will be out of the league (hopefully, you never know…), the Warriors will be on the trailing end of their run (if they’re able to keep everyone), and we will have 3 (maybe even 4) emerging stars. I would watch the shit out of this team and they have the ability to be more fun to watch then those Baby Bulls teams. Also this team would make sense for Wade to stay, to actually be a mentor for these guys, and not kick them when they’re down. Sorry, still salty about his comments – not a good look for a leader.


I personally love this plan, but with how Reinsdorf runs this team he just wants to make profit on them by keeping them a perennial 1 and done playoff team. This is why GarPax are constantly trying to add older “NBA ready” players from the draft and signing stars way past their prime (Boozer and Wade) because their jobs rely on us staying at that position. I’d love for it to happen and I want a clean slate for this team, however it’s very unlikely to happen.

Tl;dr:

Trade Jimmy for Jaylen Brown and Nets pick

Tank rest of season and get late top 10 pick

Draft two top ten picks in historically great draft – possible 3rd pick if Kings get their shit together

*Get younger and more athletic*

Develop and wait out the rein of the LeBron and the Warriors

"There's a lot of reaction both ways right now calling for JB to be traded or people defending him for his work ethic/laying it on the line for the team... My question is how do you build around him as a player? His strengths: defense, 1v1 offense, getting to the line etc
Weaknesses: shooting (I know he's significantly better than just 2 years ago but it's still not a strength), needs ball in his hands to be effective as offensive player, leadership (I get that he's developing his leadership skills but in 2 years of being The Man he's had his fair share of controversial leadership)

PG: I think you need a PG who isn't ball dominant and is a reliable outside shooter to complement him. Who comes to mind? CP3 is ball dominant but not in the way many of the other top PGs are, I don't advocate for CP3. Someone like Patrick Beverly or Schroeder or Dragic? Doesn't seem like many PGs fit this description

SG/SF: Depending what you consider Jimmy. I think a 3 and D guy would be ideal, there's a relative abundance of them in the NBA... we  however do not have one. Someone like a Trevor Ariza/ Danny Green 

PF/C: I think having Taj and Rolo fits with Jimmy. Having one of the two being a good inside option would obviously be huge and a good defensive presence as well.

Now, a friend of mine recently proposed that Jimmy is like a Carmelo Anthony player in that you can't build around him, he's a phenomenal talent but doesn't help his team get better. I could see both sides of this argument but I don't think our team has looked ANYTHING like what an ideal team built around Jimmy would look like so it's hard to say.

What say you Bullsfam? I know I must've overlooked tons of good options and am very willing to acknowledge better roster thoughts","How would you ideally build around Jimmy Butler? There's a lot of reaction both ways right now calling for JB to be traded or people defending him for his work ethic/laying it on the line for the team... My question is how do you build around him as a player? His strengths: defense, 1v1 offense, getting to the line etc
Weaknesses: shooting (I know he's significantly better than just 2 years ago but it's still not a strength), needs ball in his hands to be effective as offensive player, leadership (I get that he's developing his leadership skills but in 2 years of being The Man he's had his fair share of controversial leadership)

PG: I think you need a PG who isn't ball dominant and is a reliable outside shooter to complement him. Who comes to mind? CP3 is ball dominant but not in the way many of the other top PGs are, I don't advocate for CP3. Someone like Patrick Beverly or Schroeder or Dragic? Doesn't seem like many PGs fit this description

SG/SF: Depending what you consider Jimmy. I think a 3 and D guy would be ideal, there's a relative abundance of them in the NBA... we  however do not have one. Someone like a Trevor Ariza/ Danny Green 

PF/C: I think having Taj and Rolo fits with Jimmy. Having one of the two being a good inside option would obviously be huge and a good defensive presence as well.

"Let's face it - the Bulls are at best a mediocre team right now. We aren't going to win anything in the near future, so unless we also don't want to win anything in the not-so-near future, it's time to start rebuilding.

* Trade Butler. It pains me to say this, but I think it must be done. Butler has the potential to be a franchise player, and I would have loved to see him do it here in Chicago, but with the current supporting cast he's not going to win anything. His value is never going to be higher as a Bull than it is now; if we keep holding on to him while the Bulls fade into obscurity, his value will inevitably drop. Trade him to a contender and get some top-level prospects in return so that we can rise again in a few years.
* Let Wade leave. As mentioned above, we aren't winning anything this year or next, so having an aging veteran is pointless. Wade is eating up an enormous amount of salary and holding back the development of younger players who would otherwise be on the floor in his place. The good news is that Wade already seems to be considering opting out of his second year; if we trade Butler and go into full rebuild mode, Wade is almost certain to leave.
* Trade Mirotic. Seriously.
* Re-sign Felicio when the time comes.
* Trade Rondo.
* Give Valentine more playing time. Wade's and Rondo's departures would facilitate this greatly. Valentine was a top-level NCAA player at Michigan State, and he has shown glimpses of promise at the NBA level. But he can't develop without playing time.

I've seen people say to build around Butler, but that's not going to work. In order to build, you must have pieces. And we're not going to get any better pieces than we have already by trading mediocre players for other mediocre players. Other teams aren't stupid and won't give us anything if we can't offer anything of value.

Some veterans are necessary to show youngsters the ropes, so I think we should keep Gibson if he is willing to stay. If not, then it becomes Lopez's role. McDermott has potential to be a good role player, so keep him. Zipser and Grant are fine as backups. MCW is too, but I don't know what his status is given recent occurrences.

Finally, change needs to happen from the top down. GarPax have made questionable decisions throughout their tenure and their position must be seriously considered. Similarly, Hoiberg is simply not an NBA-caliber coach right now (if you need evidence of this, just look at how he runs last possessions in close games). I don't know if there's a better coach on the market, but it's definitely something to think about. Maybe Hoiberg will come good given time and a different roster though, so who knows.

It's time to rebuild. If we start now, it won't be too long before we're contending again. But if we chase the futile dream of being relevant in the next couple years, the eventual fall will be that much harder.","It's time for the Bulls to begin rebuilding Let's face it - the Bulls are at best a mediocre team right now.

"Damn. People are so in the moment. This is such an overreaction. 

Were Jimmy's comments out of line?

Absolutely. 

But he's frustrated. He just wants to win. 

I'm sick of this talk about Hollywood Butler. Or trading Jimmy while you still can. It's bullshit. 

He had arguably the worst game of his career. And the Bulls suffered the consequences. But bottom line, he's been nothing short of phenomenal this season. 

His work ethic and demeanor might rub people the wrong way, but he's not trying to offend anybody. He just wants to win. 

This is the same guy that has to deal with Gar and Pax's bull crap. When they were in trade negotiations (that Gar refuses to admit happened), where was Jimmy?

Working out. Grinding. As usual. 

This is what happens when you don't win. People are so quick to forget what Jimmy has done for this team, especially this season. Just because of a rough few days. 

You don't see him cowering in the corner. You'll never see that from Butler. 

I mean, when Jimmy was asked about his season, he said, ""I ain't done shit man. We're a game below .500. As far as I'm concerned, I'm not doing my job."" 

He just wants to win. But in order to win, he needs the appropriate players around him. Stop blaming him for the Bulls collapse. 

I swear. Some of the people calling to trade Jimmy and saying the fame got to his head, are the same ones that were riding his dick a few weeks ago. 

As far as I'm concerned, if you hate on your star player for a few inappropriate comments, you have no business calling yourself a fan. 

But maybe that's just me. I'll stick with this team no matter what. I'm not the General Manager. Those decisions are out of my hands. But I'll back Butler and the Bulls win or lose.

"There is no way Jimmy is getting back the locker room after his comment.


That is why it is wise for GarPaxDorf to push the rebuild button now.

&nbsp;
#Primary reason of why we need to rebuild


We are not going to win the championship in the next three year or so. Why bother wasting Jimmy's prime year and pay him huge money?


The Golden State Warriors can keep Steph, Klay, Kevin and Dray and still has over $20M in cap space to sign a starting center.


How about Serge Ibaka? Durant may even give a portion of his salary for Serge.


That being said, it is unthinkable how this franchise can win a ring against Steph, Klay, Kevin, Dray and Serge. Livingston and Iggy would glad take a pay cut to play for a special team like that.

&nbsp;
#The Plan


Since the make up of our team is barely enough to compete for even a playoff spot, we may as well spend the time rebuilding. We will compete when these super teams are past their prime.


&nbsp;
#Draft Markelle Fultz


We will have a great shot of landing him if LA gets the #1 overall.


Jimmy will instantly make them a playoff team. And we all know how Jimmy likes LA, so his going to stay there. Lakers would be competing against GSW in no time.


The same can be said with Philly, because they don't have a SG. With Jimmy Butler on board, it's easy to lure a PG. Kyle Lowry? George Hill? Jeff Teague? Derrick Rose? Even Chris Paul or Stephen Curry can be have :) Maybe bringing back Jrue Holiday is enough :D

One of those PG(hopefully someone who can shoot), Jimmy, Saric, Simmons and Embiid would be a great five. Then they have Okafor and Noel off the bench or they can use them as trade bait. Overall I see this trade happening.


My problem is if Miami or Brooklyn gets the pick.


I can see Miami trading for Jimmy. But it's not guaranteed. Jimmy doesn't make them a contender. Brooklyn on the other hand is expected to pick Fultz the moment they got the microphone.


If Suns fall and manage to get the pick, we also have a good chance of trading for it. They have two starting PG and Booker needs Jimmy there. The same can be said if Dallas or Orlando falls in the standings.


&nbsp;
#House Cleaning


Bulls obviously need to do a house cleaning. But they can do it before the trade deadline.


I can see Taj being traded, if we don't have a chance to make the playoffs. Idk what they can get out of MCW, but I'm giving him up for a high second rounder.


Niko will likely stay, because Bulls aren't getting anything out of him. Might as well retain him and Rondo(if he agrees to continue to play off the bench) for this rebuilding process.


After trading Jimmy at draft night, Bulls might also entertain the idea of trading RoLo for a first rounder. I'm pretty there would be a teams who will need him. He has a friendly contract anyway.

"Okay so I know a lot of people are feeling the same way as I am right now — we're struggling to win consistently, there's a myriad of issues with our roster and how it's coached and our front office, and we're burning away Butler's prime as a team that can't secure its spot in the top eight. 

I'm not sure what fixes this. We can fire Hoiberg, but we still have a poorly-constructed roster and coaches will be hesitant to come here if they believe ownership has no patience. We can trade away players and try to tank, but that blows and it doesn't seem likely, given GarPax's commitment to ""butts in seats"" and Reinsdorf wanting the revenue. We can make incremental roster changes, trying to move expiring deals around at the deadline, but this team needs a bigger overhaul than just moving Niko or Taj. 

Everyone knows we could probably benefit by firing our GMs. That's again not likely, though Forman's refusal to take media questions could lead to something bigger down the road. We can hope that Former President Obama decides to cash in and become a partial owner (he has mentioned that before), because it'd be nice to have someone paying the bills that actually cares about basketball. 

Personally, I'm hoping (as much as I love him) that Wade leaves. It gives us a huge amount of cap space, and if we waived all of our bird rights on Cris/Taj/MCW/Niko/Canaan (not saying we should do that for all of them, but it is an option) and let Rondo walk, we'd be at $63 mil in cap space in a terrific FA year. Even retaining Felicio and say, MCW, we still would have a ton of space for a max player and two ~8mil/year deals. The possibility of retooling the roster, especially into something that fits Hoiberg's strengths, is really exciting. 

I'm not sure if this was a vent, a hopeful post, or a list of options, but what ideas do you have for the future? How do you feel about these options?","Languishing in Bubble Team Hell Okay so I know a lot of people are feeling the same way as I am right now — we're struggling to win consistently, there's a myriad of issues with our roster and how it's coached and our front office, and we're burning away Butler's prime as a team that can't secure its spot in the top eight.

"Fred besides his ability to lead this team the biggest issue I have is that he can not develop players. Everyone who has improved is because of themselves, i.e Jimmy. Most of our young players have  overall regressed or not much improvement. The players give you a flash of better player but its short lived.

Doug: Regressed (1st round pick)

Niko: Regressed (1st round pick)

Bobby: Regressed (1st round pick)

Grant: Regressed (1st round pick)

MCW: Regressed (1st round pick)

Canaan: Regressed (#34 overall pick)

Valentine: ?? (1st round pick)

We have 7 First round picks under 25 which has good potential on paper and the most promising one is Doug who we gave 2 first rounders for.

This is about drafting but its about fred not being able to develop these players.  Besides none of them improving why is valentine not getting valuable time at pg with wade and butler so he can develop? Bulls have tried every point guard except the #14 pick. 

Are they not giving Denzel time because they are afraid to admit they screwed up badly on this pick? Although they have missed on picks I dont think he has been given a fair chance since he is lacking playing time but more because fred does not know how to develop young players/players at all.  I dont get why he doesnt want to play him?

I know he was at a ""smaller"" college but his players havent developed into NBA talent, with proper coaching I feel he should have more success and improvement.

"Because of how mediocre the team has been this year and because of the recent controversy of last night's game, I've been thinking about what direction I think the Bulls should go in as a franchise. Now, of course, I'm no basketball expert, but here are some of my conclusions:

1) This one's easy. Fire GarPax. Obvi. 

2) This one will be harder to swallow: blow it all up, and that's including trading away Jimmy.

Now, I know that some of you are going to respond that we shouldn't trade Jimmy away because we want to draft players like Jimmy: potential superstars. However, after some research I did today on the past 36 championship NBA teams (from 1980, around the time the modern NBA started), I came to this conclusion for a few reasons:

1)  33/36 teams won because they had either one or more players who have either won an MVP in the past, that season, or would in the future. Look, I love Jimmy (even with this most recent controversy). It was amazing seeing him rise from a rookie to most improved player to the almost superstar he is today. However, I don't know if he is or ever will be at an MVP level. Next season, he'll be 28, which means he only has a couple seasons left in his prime. He's killing it this season, but do we really think he's going to be the leader of a team that will defeat either the Cavs or the Warriors/Spurs/Rockets in the Western Conference over the next few years? I just don't think so.

2) Tanking and good draft picks in general have been a consistent way in which teams have won championships, including the 90s' Bulls (as you all know, Jordan was drafted 3rd, Pippen 5th, and Horace Grant 10th for the first three peat). 24 of the 36 teams who have won championships won with two or more of their core players having been originally drafted by that team. For instance, on the 1980s Celtics, Bird was drafted 6th, while McHale was drafted the 3rd the next year. And the problem is, as long as we have Jimmy, we're never going to get high enough, surefire draft picks. If this was back during the Thibs era or in the late 2000s, when we had amazing scouts like Matt Lloyd, this would be a different conversation, as we were able to draft a bunch of future stars that weren't in the top 10, like Jo and Taj, and of course Jimmy. However, as we all know, our recent draft picks, which have been higher than during the Thibs era, have been underperforming, like Bobby or Niko. In case GarPax is never fired (which would be a fucking nightmare), we would need tank in order to ensure solid draft picks.

So those are my thoughts. Agree or disagree, I'd love to know what ya'll think.","My Thoughts on this Shitstorm of a Season and the Future Because of how mediocre the team has been this year and because of the recent controversy of last night's game, I've been thinking about what direction I think the Bulls should go in as a franchise.

"We all know that Hoiberg has inconsistency picking which players will start, come off the bench or play at all. Some of us are extremely annoyed by this thing because this could be one of the reasons that our young players don't perform consistently, don't have confidence in themself or don't develop. But we never know what's happening behind the scenes, if Hoiberg plays only the players that are working hard on practice, how would you guys feel about the rotations? Would you have at least a little bit of respect for Hoiberg? I think that he is still trying to figure things out, and I really want things to work out but his future is not looking very bright.

"The fan base seems to agree that Forman and Paxson both need to go, but I haven't heard as much outcry for Hoiberg's job. He's not a good coach. Hoiberg was a **significant** downgrade from Thibodeau. His ""highly touted"" offense has been mediocre at best. Our defense is allowing the sixth fewest points per game, yet we can't outscore our opponents on a nightly basis. Hoiberg's Bulls teams have had 5 losing streaks of three or more games this season (11 total in his two years as coach). Thibodeau had 6 in his five years with the Bulls. Hoiberg is a huge part of the problem. It's tough to follow someone like Thibs, and I've tried to give him a chance. I've defended him on this sub, but enough is enough.
  
I wonder if Jimmy and Wade's comments last night extend to Hoiberg and the coaching staff. It's part of his job to light a fire under people's asses and get on people for lackadaisical play. To be fair, he could be doing this in the locker room, but I doubt it. He sets the tone for this team. He looks lost out there half the time, and so does this team. He's a bad coach, and he needs to be fired at the end of the season (at the latest) with the rest of upper management. It's time to clean house.

* What's the situation like with Bobby Portis? I could've sworn at one point he was playing well, but I think there's been a negative response to him?

* Do you see any potential trades for a playoff run or would you guys rather get a lottery pick? 

* With this season half over, where do you guys see the team going in terms of the future (next 2-3 years)?

Thanks to whoever reads/engages. It's 4:53 AM over here in the west coast and I'm curious for some insight. Best of luck to you guys!

"I love Jimmy Butler. I love certain players on our team. But it's time for our front office to start thinking with our heads and we all know this. I don't want us to end up like the Knicks. For the past 6 years the Knicks have been a beacon of shit front office decision making and it all came full circle by giving Melo a max with a NTC when they really should've shopped him around once Stoudemire went down. We need to shop everyone we have except for Jimmy, Wade, and Lopez (decent center on cheap contract) now. We love Taj, but his value is at its highest now, let's not fuck up like last year with Pau and trade him for some good prospects to teams that would want him (such as the Raptors), let's move around Doug, Mirotic, Rondo (lol), Portis, and basically everyone but maybe Felicio and try to bring in a chance of a good pick (in a Taj trade case) or role players who are better overall that can 3+D or just at least know how to play offense and defense on a more consistent basis.

"This post is for people to share thoughts on how to build a championship contender around Jimmy Butler. 


The east is being run by the Cavs this year. If the Raptors can land a star, or the Celtics two stars, the next two years (2018,2019) could see a shift of power but I'm not quite sure what the salary/free agent implications are so I won't expand on that.


A hot take but I think that after 2019, LeBron is going to join forces with Pop (on the Spurs, most likely). Provided the dude is still coaching. Plethora of reasons here but I think the ones that stand out are:


(1) Pop's track record with deep playoff runs (Rings, Erneh) and minute management of superstars in their mid 30s

(2) Kawhi Leonard

(3) Notion that as he gets older, his ability to carry teams will decline, and will thus need his IQ + Pop's IQ + SA's system to get to the Finals


Anyways that's just speculation on my part. I don't think leaving Cleveland the 2nd time will be as bad as the first because he brought them a championship (and they could win 1-2 more). 


So back to our father. What does Jimmy need around him for the Bulls to challenge the Cavs and Western Conference? What kind of system would he flourish in? I have no idea and wanted to see what people could come up with. ","How to build around Jimmy Butler?

"Hi. Since Rudy Gay got injured, Sacramento looks once again to be getting that Top 10 pick. But they do also have a pick-swap with Philly. So here's my question. If by a miracle should Philadelphia make the Playoffs (Trust the Process) or at least end up with a pick outside Top 10 this year, they'll swap their pick with Sacramento. So now Sacramento will be picking outside Top 10, do we get their swapped pick then or we'll still have just that 2nd rounder?","Sacramento pick question in regards of Philly Hi.

"I did some research as to our best 2 man lineups by Net Pts/48 min. I only utilized combo's that have over 100 minutes played...

The BEST 2 man line-up is... 

Doug McDermott and Nikola Mirotic, with over 400 minutes played.

The next 4 top 2 man line-ups include Jimmy Butler, go figure. But they are Jimmy and Felicio, and Grant, and Mirotic, and McDermott.

What does this mean? It means something I've been thinking for a while, that won't go over well... Taj Gibson should be coming off the bench, again.

Expanding this to 3 man, the best line-up backs this up, as it is Butler, Doug, Niko. 

Our best line-up by far would be MCW/Jimmy/Doug/Niko/Lopez.

The problem then becomes the bench again, with Wade and Taj playing bigger minutes off the bench, (Wade already does), there are some consistent players who can create their own offense. But you'd want to run Grant and Valentine with this lineup to add 3 point shooting.

Tl;DR Taj should move to the bench in favor of Nikola Mirotic.

This way we keep Butler and get a pretty solid player with good potential and we have enough money to splash at some fa.

"Fred gets criticized a lot around these parts, sometimes fairly, but one thing I never see him given credit for is his willingness to experiment and try different lineups if something isn't working. 

By my calculations, for comparison and example, in his last season with us Thibs used a total of 3 different starting lineups that weren't a direct result of a starter being injured, and his bench rotations overwhelmingly consistent as well. 

By comparison, already this season Hoiberg has used 4 different starting lineups not resulting from injury, the most obvious change bringing MCW into the starting lineup and moving Rondo to the bench, both of which have proven to be rather savey moves, especially biting the bullet with Rondo's attitude. Furthermore, he's fazed Portis out because of his poor play, as he also has with Caanan. Zipper has started seeing an uptick in time, even if only to see what he has, and Felicio has also begun seeing much more time too. And he's been very solid with the fringe guys like Grant, playing him in games where he's got it going, and keeping a short leash in games where he doesn't. 

These may seem like relatively obvious moves in hindsight, but it's good that's he's recognized that they needed to be made and didn't hesitate in doing them, and the team looks like it might be starting to trend upward because of that.

I am a life long Dirk Nowitzki fan, as well as a recent Bulls fan. I'm going to the game vs the Mavs to night. Seeing that Dirk might retire soon, I'm super excited to see him play. 

I've heard before that if you get to the game early, right when the gate opens. They will allow you to go down to the sideline and see the players warm up up close and even interact with them. Does that still stand true?  My ticket is in the 300s level. But I'm dying to see Dirk and maybe ask for his autograph, as well as the Bulls. Has anyone tried recently or got any tips? Thanks in advance!","Getting to the game early to see the players Hello!

"Hey guys,

I've been wanting to post this on behalf of our sub for quite some time but things have kept me busy and the games just keep on coming so that didn't help either... 

Anyways, a couple of months ago, the Bulls Digital Team got in touch with us to see if they could get all of us moderators to attend a game and after a bit of back and forth and lots of discussions and scheduling, we were able to come to a close and ended up picking the game against the Wizards on December 21st.

We started off the day with some lunch at Portillo's and we all went down to the United Center to meet with the Bulls and get acclimated and get all our badges sorted. First, we walked by the court where we could see the Luvabulls warm up along with Zipser, Felicio & Portis. We also got to take a picture of all of us at center court which was a pretty awesome experience.

A couple of hours later, we all walked across the street and got a guided tour of the Advocate Center which was pretty darned cool to say the least. At the very end, we got to sit down in the players film room and got a little impromptu Q&A session with u/ctsbulls (Chuck Swirsky for those unfamiliar). We already had Chuck here on the sub for an AMA a while back and he did really well. It was really fun because Chuck is such an engaging person and you can literally hear the passion in his voice whether he's talking about the Bulls or the league in general.

Finally, we headed back to the United Center one last time to get to our seat before the game started. We got a little surprised as well, Benny showed up to our section around the third quarter and messed around a little bit and got all of us really good with silly string (the highlight of my day personally, ha. I know I'm not surprising anyone with that one). Anyways, the game came to a close and I know I'm not going to spoiler alert anybody but we ended up losing the game by 10 points and here we thought we were going to start a streak as a group, so much for that!

All in all, this was a really great experience for all of us since we met up for the very first time together not to mention that u/McNasti made the trip from Germany to join us which was really awesome and obviously a big deal.

I want to, again, thank the Bulls organization for reaching out to us, the Bulls Digital Team for being awesome as well as super friendly and accommodating. We now have a line of communication open with them and will be able to hopefully do more really cool things surrounding the Bulls and Reddit as well as social media in general. Thank you again and let's hope we can do something like this again.

Thank you,  
Your r/chicagobulls moderating team.  ","r/ChicagoBulls spend a windy night in the city with the Bulls organization Hey guys,

I've been wanting to post this on behalf of our sub for quite some time but things have kept me busy and the games just keep on coming so that didn't help either... 

Anyways, a couple of months ago, the Bulls Digital Team got in touch with us to see if they could get all of us moderators to attend a game and after a bit of back and forth and lots of discussions and scheduling, we were able to come to a close and ended up picking the game against the Wizards on December 21st.

We started off the day with some lunch at Portillo's and we all went down to the United Center to meet with the Bulls and get acclimated and get all our badges sorted. First, we walked by the court where we could see the Luvabulls warm up along with Zipser, Felicio & Portis. We also got to take a picture of all of us at center court which was a pretty awesome experience.

A couple of hours later, we all walked across the street and got a guided tour of the Advocate Center which was pretty darned cool to say the least. At the very end, we got to sit down in the players film room and got a little impromptu Q&A session with u/ctsbulls (Chuck Swirsky for those unfamiliar). We already had Chuck here on the sub for an AMA a while back and he did really well. It was really fun because Chuck is such an engaging person and you can literally hear the passion in his voice whether he's talking about the Bulls or the league in general.

Finally, we headed back to the United Center one last time to get to our seat before the game started. We got a little surprised as well, Benny showed up to our section around the third quarter and messed around a little bit and got all of us really good with silly string (the highlight of my day personally, ha. I know I'm not surprising anyone with that one). Anyways, the game came to a close and I know I'm not going to spoiler alert anybody but we ended up losing the game by 10 points and here we thought we were going to start a streak as a group, so much for that!

All in all, this was a really great experience for all of us since we met up for the very first time together not to mention that u/McNasti made the trip from Germany to join us which was really awesome and obviously a big deal.

I want to, again, thank the Bulls organization for reaching out to us, the Bulls Digital Team for being awesome as well as super friendly and accommodating. We now have a line of communication open with them and will be able to hopefully do more really cool things surrounding the Bulls and Reddit as well as social media in general. Thank you again and let's hope we can do something like this again.

Go Bulls! \#SeeRed

"Not sure if this needs its own post but I didn't see a ""trade"" thread and I wanted y'all's opinions on this.

Nets give Bogdanovic and a 2017 2nd in exchange for Rondo and the Sac 1st.

The nets need a pick and are well under the salary floor, they could take the dump and offer a buyout. From my understanding, he's been kind of butting heads with the rest of the team/coaching staff, and is a net negative to the team (correct me if I'm wrong on that). The bulls get a solid shooting wing off the bench and lose about 10m in cap space with Bog's expiring contract, Rondo can sign elsewhere after his contract expires, and your younger guards get more minutes without the friction. Thoughts?","How do you feel about this trade? Not sure if this needs its own post but I didn't see a ""trade"" thread and I wanted y'all's opinions on this.

"As of now here are our LOCKS for our rotations:

MCW, Butler, Wade, Taj, Lopez, Doug, Niko, Felicio.

I think we will need at LEAST a 9 man rotation, preferably a 10 man for the regular season.

The final 2 spots to me are between Valentine/Rondo/Grant/Canaan. Portis to me isn't an option because he such a bonehead on defense, (and offense at times) it makes him unplayable.

My personal choices would be Rondo and Valentine. Valentine has strung a few good performances together, and we need him to be developed for next year. But he's also potentially our best 3 point shooter along with Doug, and he can actually handle the ball and create. Rondo should run the 2nd unit, surrounded by shooters he's VERY effective.

MCW/Butler/Wade/Taj/Lopez. Wade out early for Doug, then Niko for Lopez, then Rondo for MCW, and finally Felicio and Valentine for Butler and Taj.

This means we will have minutes of Rondo/Butler/Doug/Niko/Taj which I think is effective. And we will have minutes of Rondo/Wade/Valentine/Niko/Felicio which I think also is effective at spacing the floor for Wade.

"I'd love to see Denzel at the point guard this season. We might have the weakest point guards in the league, and I think Valentine could be a great game manager for the second string. He might be the third best three-point shooter on this team (I know we haven't seen it this season, but he can make some shots from outside). He did it at Michigan State, and I'd love for Hoiberg to give him the keys when the second unit is in. Here's hoping he'll see some minutes at the one.

For the record, I like MCW, and I think Hoiberg's play style fits him well. Although, I don't think he's a starter in this league.

"Prerequisite: my sub is not known for their trade intelligence. I don't claim to be an expert either but I would never suggest it's possible to trade Singler and Morrow for someone like Millsap, Griffin, or your guy Jimmy. Seriously our trade talk is insane sometimes.

Recently we've had a lot of discussion about who we should trade for to fill our gap at SF and the latest dude to talk about is Jimmy Butler. Some Thunder fans think you guys would trade him to us, but I was of the opinion that he was your guy. Franchise player who you don't wanna trade for anything. Of course any team would be lucky to have him and if he came to the thunder I would be stoked, I just don't see it ever happening.

So my question is, would you ever consider wanting to trade Jimmy or is he untouchable? If so, who would you accept for him? Would a straight up Westbrook for Butler trade work? Would you want picks? To be clear I personally wouldn't trade Westbrook for anyone in the league, it's just a conversation that came up.

Or do I have it completely wrong and you guys are open to trading him for the right piece?

Also, as an added question, what other trades (if any) would you guys be content with making to the Thunder? Regarding any player on either team.

Good luck tomorrow. I hope Jimmy has a great game but that we still win. :)","Hey Bulls fans! Thunder fan here with a trade question/discussion.

"I have been thinking about GarPax and wanted to find some way to analytically look at their drafting to see how well they have done. My goal was to see how their draft picks performed by metrics. My first analysis focuses on games played. Simply, if you last in the NBA, you clearly have some value. In order to make it fairer, I wanted to compare their draft picks relative to the career lengths of other players picked in a similar position.

****

**Methodology**

I went to basketball reference and pulled the draft data for every year since 1994. I could have gone farther back, but I stopped there. I took every draft pick and then found the average number of games by draft pick. Then I took every Bulls player that has been drafted since 2003 (Paxson’s first draft) and compared their career games versus that average. The last year I included was the 2011 draft since I wanted to limit the number of players who are still playing and thus reducing the average. 

*Note:* Mirotic was drafted in 2011, but since he didn’t start playing for a couple years, I took him out as well.

I also tried to track down every trade they have made. That way players we get a better picture of the playing careers of the players GarPax wanted. Let me know if I missed someone. It is surprisingly hard to find the details on a lot of these smaller trades.

**Results:**


Year | Pick | Player | Games | +/- Avg 
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
2009 | 16 | James Johnson | 430 | -7
2003 | 7 | Kirk Hinrich | 879 | 188 
2003 | 36 |  Mario Austin| 0 | -154 
2003 | 53 | Tommy Smith | 0 | -75 
2004 | 3 | Ben Gordon | 744 | 4
2004 | 7 | Luol Deng | 861 | 170
2004 | 22 | Viktor Khryapa | 143 | -158
2004 | 38 | Chris Duhon | 606 | 429
2006 | 4 | Tyrus Thomas | 402 | -326
2006 | 13 | Thabo Sefolosha | 711 | 147
2006 | 16 | Rodney Carney | 299 | -7
2007 | 9 | Joakim Noah | 603 | 22 
2007 | 49 | Aaron Gray | 318 | 143 
2007 | 51 |JamesOn Curry | 1 | -91
2008 | 1 | Derrick Rose | 437 | -269
2009 | 16 | James Johnson | 430 | -7
2009 | 26 | Taj Gibson | 543 | 112
2011 | 30 | Jimmy Butler | 359 | 65 


Overall, the Bulls players drafted have played 99 games over what the average for their position has over the last 22 years. With that, there are still 8 active players from that group (Deng, Sefalosha, Noah, Rose, J. Johnson, Gibson and Butler.) Of course, only 2 of those are still playing for the Bulls so that muddies an analysis of this. 

**Biggest “Overachiever”**

Chris Duhon sits at 609 career games when his draft position suggested he should have played 177.

Jimmy Butler is *only* 65 games above the average for his draft pick, but it will end up being very positive based on his 30th draft position.

**Biggest “Underachiever”**

Tyrus Thomas played 402 games, which for a 4th pick puts him at negative 326 for his career. Combine that with the trade for Lamarcus Aldridge (who is obviously still active and at +22 with 755 games played) and you have a pretty disastrous pick.

****

Of course, we all know that Rose has had injuries that have limited his playing time. Whether that should go against GarPax is debatable. The consensus top two picks were Rose and Beasley. Beasley is currently 200 games under average for second picks. Also, we had such a small chance to get the pick anyways, so it is sort of a hard situation for a proper GarPax assessment.

Recently retired Matt Bonner is another trade that surprised me with how bad it looks. He finished his career with 792 career games, which is 566 games above his 45th draft pick average of 225 games.

**Final Conclusions**

Time will tell on recent drafts, but historically it looks like GarPax have done an above average job of drafting. They have hit very big on some later picks that have helped their average up, but they have also made some bad trades to get rid of talent that ended up being valuable.

I was going to also run this data based on a performance based metric like Win Shares to compare quality of play. I appreciate any suggestions or corrections on anything that I have missed.

"I think inserting MCW into the starting lineup was a good call by Hoiberg. While Rondo does average around 7 rebounds and 7 assists (he is good in those categories), his effort and his heart just aren't there. I completely agree with Hoiberg's decision to start MCW. Although MCW has averaged 6.2 points in 9 games (Rondo, 7.2 in 29), there is an obvious difference in the amount of effort between these two. Teams are leaving Rondo wide open and he is passing up open shots. While MCW isn't much a great shooter either (29.9% FG, 16.7% 3P, compared to Rondo, 36.9% FG, 32.7% FG), he has displayed more confidence on the offensive AND defensive end of the floor. A league dominated by point guards creates the idea that the position is vital. We know what MCW is capable of (ROY, All-Rookie First Team, 16.7 points, 6.2 rebounds, 6.3 assists as a rookie), we just need him to live up to the potential that we saw during his rookie campaign.

NBA Insiders

http://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/18403339/chicago-bulls-trade-deadline-preview-jimmy-butler-dwyane-wade-rajon-rondo-nba

*Should -- and will -- the Chicago Bulls trade star guard Jimmy Butler? What about Rajon Rondo?*

Our NBA Insiders debate what moves Chicago should make before the deadline.

(1) Where are the Bulls on the buyer-seller scale?

Nick Friedell, ESPN.com: Sell! Sell! Sell! The Bulls are in the worst place a franchise can be in pro sports right now: the middle. They should do everything they can to look toward the future.

Jeremias Engelmann, ESPN Insider: The Bulls have a (nearly) 35-year-old with bad knees in Dwyane Wade, and they just demoted Rondo, their former starting point guard, to the far end of the bench because he's fighting with assistant coaches and not playing with effort. They're obviously sellers. I'd be surprised, though, if they found any buyers.

David Thorpe, ESPN Insider: Open to anything and everything. A team that's lost can get lucky -- maybe a team even more lost wants to do a deal, or perhaps a team more desperate. If Chicago can make smart trades, whether they are adding good players or moving players not working out, that would be better than standing firm.

Bradford Doolittle, ESPN Insider: In my head I'm hearing Randolph Duke from ""Trading Places"" yelling, ""Sell! Sell!"" This is a collection of basketball players that is increasingly dysfunctional. It's time this franchise became one that doesn't just say it's taking the long view, but acts like one. Need athletes? Start acquiring them.

Kevin Pelton, ESPN Insider: More sellers than buyers. I don't see Chicago moving into rebuild mode. I think the Bulls will hope to remake the roster this summer in free agency, but players on expiring contracts who may not figure into their future (notably Taj Gibson and Nikola Mirotic) could be available sooner.

(2) Would you advise the Bulls to consider trading Jimmy Butler?

Friedell: Yes. Butler has turned himself into one of the best players in the league. The Bulls' roster isn't very good. He is their most valuable asset. I don't think they will move him, but I do think they should consider it for the right offer.

Engelmann: Initiating a rebuild -- which trading Butler would likely result in -- is done for one thing: getting a superstar, most often through the draft. In Butler, who ranks sixth in Real Plus-Minus, the Bulls already have one. They also don't have horrible long-term contracts on the roster, so they could be contenders as soon as next season if they swing smart deals this summer.

Thorpe: They absolutely must consider it, though I would not say they absolutely should trade him. He is the one guy who simply cannot be moved, and should not be moved, for anything less than equal value, meaning an All-Star or a few guys with All-Star potential.

Doolittle: Because Butler is already 27, I'd consider it. Eventually, Butler will stop improving (right?) and it's fair to consider him at the apex of his value. While the Bulls don't seem to be willing to go into full-on reset mode, moving Butler for a package heavy in controllable players and draft picks would be defensible. The Celtics would be a logical partner in such a scenario. But it's so hard to find truly elite players.

Pelton: No, not now that the new CBA gives them an edge in re-signing him, should he be eligible for the designated veteran extension or exception. Until or unless Butler isn't eligible or suggests he won't sign such a deal, Chicago should build around him.

(3) Do you think the Bulls will trade Butler?

Pelton: No, for the same reasons I outlined in Question 2.

Friedell: No. They thought about it before last year's trade deadline and again before last summer's draft. I don't think they'll get enough value in return for him. He's also improved his standing in the locker room and shown he's ready for more leadership responsibility.

Engelmann: Teams don't trade superstars unless they openly demand a trade. Butler probably wishes the Bulls had a better record, but he doesn't strike me as a person that would try to force his way out. That could change if the Bulls keep Rondo and finish outside the playoffs for a third consecutive season.

Thorpe: Common sense suggests that it is not likely. He's a very good player that they can quite likely hold on to for many years. There are just not many deals that the Bulls would like enough to move him.

Doolittle: I think Butler stays. I suspect that Gar Forman and John Paxson aren't willing to gut the roster in a way that puts the Bulls into the upper reaches of the lottery. Given Jerry Reinsdorf's Buddha-like patience with front-office types, Forman and Paxson probably aren't on the hot seats they'd be on in other organizations. Still, keeping Butler keeps them in the mediocre range and they aren't likely to proactively drop below that level.

(4) Will Rajon Rondo still be on the roster after the trade deadline?

Pelton: If he is, only until a buyout is completed shortly thereafter. As Tim MacMahon explained, once Rondo was out of the rotation in Dallas, the Mavericks wanted him away from the team as soon as possible. While Rondo has handled his benching with professionalism thus far, I don't think it makes sense for either side for him to stay on the roster. And at this point, I'm not sure who would be interested in trading for Rondo, so I think a buyout is the most likely outcome.

Engelmann: The Bulls would be extremely happy if someone took Rondo off their hands. Problem is, it's unlikely anyone wants a player suspended for ""detrimental conduct"" by two of his last three teams. I'm one of many who expect Rondo's next destination to be China.

Thorpe: I would expect not. I was amazed he was signed in the first place. He represents a very old way of playing -- the pass-first point guard who holds on to the ball forever as he waits for the most likely assist. Steve Nash did similar things sometimes, but he was an elite shooter -- and a far more fun teammate to play with.

Doolittle: Very little chance. Once Rondo has his ire up, it's over, and it's not like he was helping the team anyway. The Bulls have younger options that need the court time at that position, and they need to give poor Fred Hoiberg a break. I can't see another team giving up anything for Rondo, or even wanting him, so a buyout seems the most likely outcome -- if Reinsdorf is willing to eat the money.

Friedell: No. I think Rondo and the Bulls will come to some sort of buyout. He still wants to play and the Bulls want to go in a younger direction. The Bulls rolled the dice during the summer and signed him. It didn't work. Now it's better for all involved if both parties make the divorce amicable.

(5) What's a trade the Bulls should consider?

Pelton: While it might be difficult politically for the Chicago front office to deal with former coach Tom Thibodeau, trading Taj Gibson to the Minnesota Timberwolves could make sense for both sides. I'd target Tyus Jones as a better-shooting option at point guard than the players the Bulls currently have at the position.

Doolittle: The Bulls needs to move Gibson for whatever his expiring -- but bargain-level -- contract can bring back from a contender. He's 31 and playing well, but he's also depreciating by the day.

Moving him gives Chicago the option of playing Nikola Mirotic full time in hopes that in an unchallenged role, he can become the player the Bulls thought they'd signed a few years ago. Gathering as much data as possible on Mirotic, Doug McDermott, Michael Carter-Williams, etc., in Hoiberg's system is more important than chasing a low seed in the East.

Thorpe: I'd like to see them pursue DeMarcus Cousins. That kind of trade would likely require players like Wade (for salary matching), Nikola Mirotic and Brook Lopez, along with multiple draft picks - the Bulls own the rights to the Kings' protected 2017 pick, and could return it to them. Paxson and the Bulls would be good for Cousins, and the Kings could start fresh.

Engelmann: The Bulls could use a good point guard -- preferably one who can shoot -- but I don't see them putting together packages that other teams find enticing. Carter-Williams won't net you a first-rounder anymore, and Dwyane Wade -- whose knees are almost done and because he makes $24 million per year through 2017-18 -- isn't a great trade chip, either.

Friedell: I think the Bulls would be wise to move anyone they can, but I think they should strongly consider moving on from Wade. He has been great for the Bulls both on and off the floor, but he's not a long-term fit in Chicago. Help him land in a nice place and free up some cap space for the future. Wade's departure would also allow for younger players to get minutes.

I don't think the Bulls will do this, but I think it would help them in the long run.","ESPN Insiders Roundtable: Will the Bulls Trade Butler, Rondo? **Predictions: Will Bulls trade Wade, Butler, Rondo?**

(4) Will Rajon Rondo still be on the roster after the trade deadline?

Pelton: If he is, only until a buyout is completed shortly thereafter. As Tim MacMahon explained, once Rondo was out of the rotation in Dallas, the Mavericks wanted him away from the team as soon as possible. While Rondo has handled his benching with professionalism thus far, I don't think it makes sense for either side for him to stay on the roster. And at this point, I'm not sure who would be interested in trading for Rondo, so I think a buyout is the most likely outcome.

Engelmann: The Bulls would be extremely happy if someone took Rondo off their hands. Problem is, it's unlikely anyone wants a player suspended for ""detrimental conduct"" by two of his last three teams. I'm one of many who expect Rondo's next destination to be China.

Thorpe: I would expect not. I was amazed he was signed in the first place. He represents a very old way of playing -- the pass-first point guard who holds on to the ball forever as he waits for the most likely assist. Steve Nash did similar things sometimes, but he was an elite shooter -- and a far more fun teammate to play with.

Doolittle: Very little chance. Once Rondo has his ire up, it's over, and it's not like he was helping the team anyway. The Bulls have younger options that need the court time at that position, and they need to give poor Fred Hoiberg a break. I can't see another team giving up anything for Rondo, or even wanting him, so a buyout seems the most likely outcome -- if Reinsdorf is willing to eat the money.

Friedell: No. I think Rondo and the Bulls will come to some sort of buyout. He still wants to play and the Bulls want to go in a younger direction. The Bulls rolled the dice during the summer and signed him. It didn't work. Now it's better for all involved if both parties make the divorce amicable.

(5) What's a trade the Bulls should consider?

Pelton: While it might be difficult politically for the Chicago front office to deal with former coach Tom Thibodeau, trading Taj Gibson to the Minnesota Timberwolves could make sense for both sides. I'd target Tyus Jones as a better-shooting option at point guard than the players the Bulls currently have at the position.

Doolittle: The Bulls needs to move Gibson for whatever his expiring -- but bargain-level -- contract can bring back from a contender. He's 31 and playing well, but he's also depreciating by the day.

Moving him gives Chicago the option of playing Nikola Mirotic full time in hopes that in an unchallenged role, he can become the player the Bulls thought they'd signed a few years ago. Gathering as much data as possible on Mirotic, Doug McDermott, Michael Carter-Williams, etc., in Hoiberg's system is more important than chasing a low seed in the East.

Thorpe: I'd like to see them pursue DeMarcus Cousins. That kind of trade would likely require players like Wade (for salary matching), Nikola Mirotic and Brook Lopez, along with multiple draft picks - the Bulls own the rights to the Kings' protected 2017 pick, and could return it to them. Paxson and the Bulls would be good for Cousins, and the Kings could start fresh.

Engelmann: The Bulls could use a good point guard -- preferably one who can shoot -- but I don't see them putting together packages that other teams find enticing. Carter-Williams won't net you a first-rounder anymore, and Dwyane Wade -- whose knees are almost done and because he makes $24 million per year through 2017-18 -- isn't a great trade chip, either.

Friedell: I think the Bulls would be wise to move anyone they can, but I think they should strongly consider moving on from Wade. He has been great for the Bulls both on and off the floor, but he's not a long-term fit in Chicago. Help him land in a nice place and free up some cap space for the future. Wade's departure would also allow for younger players to get minutes.

I don't think the Bulls will do this, but I think it would help them in the long run.",21,4,"ESPN Insiders Roundtable: Will the Bulls Trade Butler, Rondo?",https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/5m3zz3/espn_insiders_roundtable_will_the_bulls_trade/

"I'll present this without much comment. Obviously there are many pieces to this trade, thus there are potentially many bones to pick. Before anyone asks, it works in the trade machine.

&nbsp;

**Bulls get:** Nerlens Noel, Brandon Knight, Terrence Ross

**Suns get:** Rajon Rondo, Lucas Nogueira, 2017 TOR/LAC 1st Rounder (whichever is better)

**Raptors get:** Taj Gibson, PJ Tucker

**Sixers get:** 2017 CHI 1st rounder, 2017 SAC 1st rounder, Jared Sullinger, Jerian Grant, plus their choice of Doug McDermott / Denzel Valentine

&nbsp;

*Brief motivations for each team:*


**Bulls:** Sync team's age with Jimmy (Knight and Ross are both 25) while adding shooting (Ross but also Knight), defense (Noel), and athleticism (all three).

**Suns:** Get cap space (Rondo would likely be cut) and a young, useful center under team control for a season and a half (allowing them to let Len walk). They would also pick up a late 1st rounder.

**Raptors:** Get a two-way PF that's ready to win now, plus a defensive back-up SF (likely a rental) that they've coveted as recently as the most recent trade deadline. Taj also might be more attractive to the Raptors than Paul Millsap is, given that Millsap would likely command a higher re-sign price over the summer (he's likely to opt out after this season). This is of extra importance because Kyle Lowry will be opting out after this year and the Raptors will probably end up maxing him.

**Sixers:** Any trade they make involving Noel has to bring back (preferably good, team-controlled) youth in return. The two picks will likely be late-lottery / just outside the lottery (SAC's pick seems as likely as ever to fall outside its top-10 protection). The Sixers need guards / wings; Grant seems like he'll be a useful NBA player (maybe backup combo guard), while Doug/Denzel look like bench shooters at worst (I assume PHI would choose Doug over Denzel). Sullinger is just in there to make the money work.

"I hate that they have mock drafts so early now. The fact that Chad Ford has 2.0 already is crazy. He currently projects the Bulls to get the 13th pick and to take Terrance Ferguson. 

Not knowing the name I decided to dig into it. He is a 6'5"" to 6'7"", 18yo. Some may have heard his name before because he was an McDonald's All-American last year. He had offers to go to some good college programs including Louisville but decided to go play pro in Australia. 

Digging even deeper I found some of his very limited highlights. Some of which stood out quite a bit that it got me really, really fucking hyped. 

On April 9 playing for the USA junior national select team he broke the record for 3s made in a game with 7. He can shoot. 

Less than a month later, he won a ball is life dunk contest with a free throw line dunk. His foot was past the line, but watching other dunks from him it's clear that he has serious jumps. 

Then my favorite insert the radar moment for him occurred in the Australian League while playing with grown men. He was suspended 2 games for ""striking"" another player. What it looks like happened is he was battling for a ball down low and got too physical with the arms. The guy he was striking was a 6'8"" 236lb Australian Forward. I don't think this guy is scared of anyone. 

This guy looks like the real deal. Still raw but could be a generational type player that has pro experience at a young age.

"that is one of the most fun games I have watched in a while. The bulls were playing with so much pace and everybody was moving without the ball not to mention Doug & MCW starting gave Butler so much room to work the spacing difference is incredible without Wade and Rondo. 

All the young guys on the bench played confidently and contributed. Doug who started struggled from three not sure what's up with Doug's 3 point shot IDK if he's not confident in his 3 point shot or maybe is just rushing it but he has to get his shot going again he's a better shooter than this. Though Doug has an outstanding post-game and I'm not surprised by it cause he worked in the post so much in college. Doug is much more of a versatile offensive player than what he is given credit for. Confidence grew as he worked in the post.

Niko struggled shooting but all this talk of Niko not being a good/decent defender has to stop. I thought he played outstanding defense down the stretch. Niko may be a wild player but his defense is not all bad.

Valentine finally played 17 minutes and he was impressive 9 points/3 assists/1 steal and was 3-6 overall (3-5 from three). You knew Valentine was gonna hit his shots eventually really good to see and was confident but his defense is problematic.

Grant has shown flashes at times but he makes some dumb plays at times as well. Grant is a good athlete/ATH and can play decent defense. He doesn't really have a jump shot but he does an outstanding job attacking the basket which when he does that he is at his best cause I feel that is his strength IMO. 

Felicio for a big man that dude is pretty athletic at 266 lbs. He does an excellent job at guarding the P&R and his defense in general is okay. He makes some mistakes defensively but he is pretty raw he shown some nice flashes at times. In limited numbers, he is a really good offensive rebounder 2.3 a game and averages 4.7 rebounds per game. He does not have very good hands and not a good finisher but he's very raw gotta give him more minutes.

Butler, I don't have to say much just an outstanding performance by him. He really has grown as each season has gone by. At this point, I'm keeping Butler NO WAY I'm trading Butler unless I get a deal that is a huge win he is worth so much at this point. Right now build around Butler and the young guys develop them give em minutes.

IMO I would love to watch Butler and a lot of young guys playing with Butler. I would pay to see that and be willing to watch more often opposed to Wade and Rondo who are declining. Rondo just dribbles the clock out while Wade takes too many bad contested pull-ups and fade-aways and don't even get back on defense at times though I'd like Wade to take on a bench role which would be better for the team. 

List your thoughts below and etc.","IDK about you guys but man yesterday's game was fun. that is one of the most fun games I have watched in a while. The bulls were playing with so much pace and everybody was moving without the ball not to mention Doug & MCW starting gave Butler so much room to work the spacing difference is incredible without Wade and Rondo. 

All the young guys on the bench played confidently and contributed. Doug who started struggled from three not sure what's up with Doug's 3 point shot IDK if he's not confident in his 3 point shot or maybe is just rushing it but he has to get his shot going again he's a better shooter than this. Though Doug has an outstanding post-game and I'm not surprised by it cause he worked in the post so much in college. Doug is much more of a versatile offensive player than what he is given credit for. Confidence grew as he worked in the post.

Niko struggled shooting but all this talk of Niko not being a good/decent defender has to stop. I thought he played outstanding defense down the stretch. Niko may be a wild player but his defense is not all bad.

Valentine finally played 17 minutes and he was impressive 9 points/3 assists/1 steal and was 3-6 overall (3-5 from three). You knew Valentine was gonna hit his shots eventually really good to see and was confident but his defense is problematic.

Grant has shown flashes at times but he makes some dumb plays at times as well. Grant is a good athlete/ATH and can play decent defense. He doesn't really have a jump shot but he does an outstanding job attacking the basket which when he does that he is at his best cause I feel that is his strength IMO. 

Felicio for a big man that dude is pretty athletic at 266 lbs. He does an excellent job at guarding the P&R and his defense in general is okay. He makes some mistakes defensively but he is pretty raw he shown some nice flashes at times. In limited numbers, he is a really good offensive rebounder 2.3 a game and averages 4.7 rebounds per game. He does not have very good hands and not a good finisher but he's very raw gotta give him more minutes.

Butler, I don't have to say much just an outstanding performance by him. He really has grown as each season has gone by. At this point, I'm keeping Butler NO WAY I'm trading Butler unless I get a deal that is a huge win he is worth so much at this point.

2. This team has no long term bad contracts(only long term deal is jimmy and he's a steal at the price) 
3. As long as you have Jimmy, you can trade him for a haul and reset. 
4. One thing I give the bulls FO credit for is not overpaying for average or below average talent this summer (lots of players got overpaid) 

Some things could I see happing(I left out all major injury concerns as those can't really be predicted) 

Likely Best case scenario, Bulls go on a nice run from here out, find themselves as 5-7 seed and throw money at a big free agent this offseason with Wade and Jimmy recruiting. Sacramento finishes outside of the worst ten teams, now you have two first round picks and money for a Max free agent 

Likely Mid-case case scenario: Bulls fail down the stretch, miss the playoffs for the 2nd straight year, Wade opts out, hoiberg gets fired. Gar/Pax gets fired. Now you have Jimmy butler to trade, a team of young players and a lottery pick to work with and full rebuild. 

Worst case scenario- bulls sneak into the playoffs(8th seed) Niko and Mcw leave to Free agency, bulls strike out on all big names and overpay lesser guys to contend and now have lots of money tied up on a 2nd tier roster. 

Thoughts and comments welcome.

"I'm not a frequent visitor of this sub but I noticed that one of the things that's always mentioned about the bulls future is either ""retooling"" or rebuilding. I know some people think that the bulls are flexible enough to let rondo go and create cap space to make moves or sign a FA to set us up more for the future and not tank. Sadly, I frankly don't think this is at all a feasible option. Strictly looking at our current trade assets, it appears are team is in dire straits.
For reference, here are potential trade assets(not counting Jimmy Buckets because if we trade him we tank):

RoLo:
Robin Lopez is a solid/decent 28 year old starting center on a pretty nice contract. He is probably are best trade asset and could maybe net a mid to late first rounder from a ""win now"" team looking for a big(Portland?)

Wade:
Honestly, even though Wade is doing well with the bulls right now and is at all-star levelI can't see any team that would want to trade for him without giving up basically nothing. He is a 35 year old shooting guard on a one year 20 million deal with a player option. Contending teams like the Cavs, Clips, Spurs, Raps, Rockets, etc. can't afford him or have very little use as their backcourts are already crowded. Any team that isn't looking to win now would have never trade any meaningful assets because of the fact that he can just leave after this year and likely won't push them over the top. Also I just don't see GarPax ever hurting their image by trading a hofer in wade while he's having a good season for a small collection of assets.

Rondo:
Same thing as Wade(contract wise and situation wise) but younger and much worse, he simply is not good enough or good at all to get any team to trade anything more than a future second rounder or a current failing young guy, and even that is unlikely.

Mirotic:
Mirotic at the moment has almost no value and wouldn't even command a 2nd round pick. He is averaging a career slash of 40/34/80 and this year is averaging 38/30/75 while playing not so stellar D and is already 25(not old but too old for most projects). He also will be an RFA next year.

MCW:
He's worth about one tony snell, so that's his trade value.

TaJ:
Taj is an absolute beast and I'd hate to see the bulls without him
but if we traded him he could likely command a late 1st/early 2nd or a player around that value. He's cheap contract wise so contending and ""win now"" teams looking for a role player to boost them would be very interested, however not many other teams would be interested because he is a free agent next year and is 32.

Doug McBuckets:
I don't see why he would ever be traded if we are retooling/tanking but he is a solid young role player on a good contract so he would see interest from many teams, still unlikely to get more than a mid to late first, and that's being very optimistic. 

Everyone else is either too unproven, young, or terrible to fetch anything at all substantial along with the fact that we likely are not looking to trade guys like Felicio, Portis, and Valentine in the event of a retool.


Okay so that's the trade assets, what about free agents?
Strictly looking at 2017, all the marquee ones(Curry, Durant, Griffin, Paul, Hayward, Lowry) would clearly not sign with us due to our current situation and the great teams they are on. Millsap has a slim chance of coming if we offer the max, but he is likely to be traded and other more appealing teams might also offer him the max. Most young promising players like Caldwell-Pope, Noel, Plumlee, Olynyk, Roberson are restricted and will get paid for by their teams and/or have a better team they are currently on. Many talented veterans like Gasol, Ginobli, Livingston, Igoudala, Randolph would likely not come here for obvious reasons. This basically leaves us with a slim chance at Paul Millsap and Olynyk and a small chance to sign and likely overpay for Serge Ibaka, Jrue Holiday, Danilo Gallinari, Rudy Gay, Jeff Teague, and George Hill. However I think that it's likely Hill, Holiday, and Gay(if he's traded) stay on their teams. Serge, Gallanari, and Teague will likely be fought for by other teams and get paid a lot of money, meaning if we sign one we give them close to the max which would likely cement us as an 8-7 seed for the next 3 years and destroy any cap space. 

The Bulls really have 2 options here: rebuild and trade Jimmy or toil away at 7-8th seed at best until Jimmy's contract runs out in 2019. IF you guys are interested, I could make a post about how I think bulls should rebuild and trade Jimmy.","Why the Bulls can't retool and are destined to fail on their current path I'm not a frequent visitor of this sub but I noticed that one of the things that's always mentioned about the bulls future is either ""retooling"" or rebuilding.

"Do you guys realize there is not a single team that tanks this year even 76ers have won 8 games when there is still 50 games to go! Last season they only won 10, nets dont have any picks so they dont have a reason to tank, dallas will probably win 25-30 games if nowitzki can play rest of the season, suns are doing okay(i mean they are obviously not good but they won 10 games and as i said that was the worst record in the nba at the end of last season.)

This is the perfect season to start over, i dont believe this draft holds 10-15 all stars as everyones saying but if we can get one of the top 3 guys that would be a great start for a rebuild.","Perfect season to tank.

"I think the Bulls should pick up Lance Stephenson right away when he's cleared from his injury.

We know Rondo isn't going to work, and we can deal with MCW running the point for our starting unit.

But if we're not making trades, a Lance Stephenson signing makes too much sense. 

He averaged 14/4/3 on 35% 3pt shooting for Memphis last year in 26 minutes.

For LAC his numbers weren't so good and he got very few minutes but shot 40% from the 3. 

This is a guy who has shooting ability, can rebound, pass, handle the ball and defend. And it's not like we're in a position where he could ""screw up"" our team.

If the Bulls sign him and run him as the defacto PG off the bench, like how Wade sometimes run the bench unit, I think it could provide a nice spark.

If it doesn't work just waive him. But I think he might thrive under the free offensive flow of Fred Hoiberg, and the tutelage of Wade and Butler.","Lance Stephenson I think the Bulls should pick up Lance Stephenson right away when he's cleared from his injury.

"This is starting to get ugly. I know the haters want to blame Rondo for the teams recent failings, but it's the coach not Rondo that should take the blame. If Rondo is failing it's because he's doing what Hoiberg wants him to do, which is basically bring the ball up court and hand it off to Butler. This is what Carlisle was doing to Rondo in Dallas, it didn't work too well there, and it's not going to work here. 

The -20 Rondo got in the Indiana loss was utter bullcrap. Teague, who Rondo was defending, made only one basket the entire time Rondo was on the floor. That was on a fast break where Rondo couldn't catch up because his feet was nailed to the 3 point line. I counted only 3 baskets scored where Rondo was even within 6 feet of the player who scored. Apart from the fast break, Teague never drove in front of Rondo the entire time Rondo was on the court. 

The refs hosed him. Rondo got called for tripping Teague, but Teague did the exact same to Rondo with no call. Rondo's second foul under the basket should have been called on Rolo, the third where Rondo ended up guarding Turner, there was 6 inches of air between him and Turner when the foul was called. 

Like Carlisle, Hoiberg has yet to figure out how to use what Rondo is good at. Karl did, and Rondo had a great year. Certainly Hoiberg has the right to tell Rondo to pass off as soon as he crosses midcourt and go stand in the corner, he has the right to tell Rondo to take threes, but we see how well that's not working. Case in point, the one 3 that Rondo took, there was 16 feet of empty space in front of him. Rondo could have easily driven to the paint and passed off to Mirotic for an easy 2 points, but he's trying to keep his coach happy by taking 3's he knows he'll likely miss.

For all the impending talk about how Rondo is poison, Rondo is just doing what he's told by the coach. He's not bitching in public, he's not whining about bad calls, he's not throwing his team-mates under the bus. As Rondo says, he's a professional and will continue to do his job, but it's not his fault if what he's being told to do doesn't work. 

If Rondo gets benched, he'll deal with it stoically, like he does every thing else, but it's certainly not his fault that the team isn't playing well.","Dallas Rondo? This is starting to get ugly.

Jimmy Butler is having a really good season and I don't think he will ever have as much value as he does now. Realistically I don't see Bulls winning a championship in the next two to three years.

The question is do we keep him like D Rose until he can't play anymore and we get nothing in return but a mediocre team to watch or do we trade he as soon as we can to gather young prospects or draft picks that will set this team up to be a serious playoff contender in a couple of years. ,If Jimmy Butler were to be traded at the deadline then I would be a happy man.

"I know it's a little bit early but I think this upcoming offseason will make it clear what this team is going to be going forward. Wade and Rondo's contracts are for 1 year plus an option for a second. We might have two first round draft picks if we end up getting the kings draft pick. Free agency is looking like it will be decent. The draft will be strong from what I have heard. I think whether the team is going to try to compete or rebuild, it is going to become much more clear in the offseason than it is now. The Bulls will have to make serious decisions that will have a great impact. It is going to be interesting to see what they will do after this season.

"As you know, we have been terrible in the 4th quarters this season. Tonight was no exception. Bulls shot 32% (16/49) in the paint tonight and lost our 21st 4th quarter of the season. We have played 29 of them so far. :(



I wanted to do a quick breakdown of a few possessions I saw tonight. Although it's a small sample, it's still very telling of how defenses are playing us especially in the closing minutes. Here we go...

Starting at the 5:54 mark in the 4th we are down 12 and as you can see, [Jimmy draws a double team w/ 19 left on the shot clock.](http://i.imgur.com/KrsPYzO.jpg) Notice Kemba Walker completely disregarding Rondo as an outside threat.

Very same possession, Jimmy passes to Taj who immediately goes to work in the paint but again, he too sees multiple defenders [including Kemba who is still lurking in the paint.](http://i.imgur.com/3LZNNQ7.jpg) Taj still manages to score though.

Next possession, [Rondo brings it down off a Charlotte miss and right away you see Kemba has no respect for that jump shot.](http://i.imgur.com/icjJOq2.jpg) Lamb sticks to his assignment on the weak side and [Rondo eventually finds Dougie in the corner.](http://i.imgur.com/aslP8zT.jpg) Now, that's a shot I think Doug should have been ready to shoot. I've seen him pass up a lot of open opportunities the last few games. Considering how this game was going and how defenses are clogging the lane, our best deep threat has to be able to pull that if the daylight is there. One could argue though, there were 18 seconds left on the shot clock but still, I think Doug has to take and make those kind of shots because they're seemingly at a premium. Moving on...


4:40 left in the 4th and [we see Taj trying to work in the post but again. Kemba slides over for the double team as Rondo moves off the ball.](http://i.imgur.com/9OWhSS1.jpg) [Kemba just leaves him all by himself on the weak side.](http://i.imgur.com/wU4X8Af.jpg)

Now down 8 with 3:47 left [Rondo initiates the offense and the target is....you guessed it... Taj!](http://i.imgur.com/PGdAOZq.jpg) This time though, Rondo sets a screen to force a a mismatch but the [limited space makes it tough for Taj to work](http://i.imgur.com/1jkgnn5.jpg) as he spins off Kemba and turns right back into Marvin Williams. Zeller is also waiting at the rim. 

Next trip down they [try running the offense through Jimmy but that double team isn't going away.](http://i.imgur.com/7qORLro.jpg) With 17 left on the shot clock they're forcing the ball out of Jimmy's hands and funneling us to the paint where we had a rough night. 

It's a small sample size but like I said before, it's very telling. Our best players aren't outside threats and our outside threats haven't been consistent. I personally think Fred has to at least sit Rondo the closing minutes of games like this. I didn't mean to pick on him here but he just happened to be in the middle of this one. Having Rondo on the floor in moment like this allow teams to double Jimmy and clog up the lane. Something's gotta give.

Taj even made a comment about it in his post game interview. Not that this is a solvable issue or something that is directly correlating to a few flat performances at home, but it must be tough for the guys to go out there and get no boost from their own crowd. It really frustrates me as a guy who watches a lot of NBA and sees other buildings get loud on a nightly basis, what do y'all think about this and what could the Bulls org do to improve it??","UC Athmosphere Went to the game monday against DET and last night against WAS.

"The quick answer is ""yes"" if you're in the majority of Bulls fans who want Thibs back and think the Bulls have underperformed the past 1+ seasons. 

The last two seasons the Bulls have gotten off to solid starts and then struggled the rest of the way. Could this just be due to teams getting more film on them and then Hoiberg being thoroughly out coached a majority of the time?

"Remember [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/5cfj5x/the_doug_mcdermott_effect_or_doug_needs_to_get/) I made a while back?  The basic point of it was that the Bulls' success was directly correlated with the number of shots McDermott takes--essentially, the more Doug shoots, the better we do.  As it turns out, the opposite is true for Butler.  The more shots he takes, the worse we do, and conversely, the fewer shots he takes, the better we do.

Last season, Butler averaged 14.6 field goal attempts per game in wins, but 16.2 attempts per game in losses.  That trend has continued this season, where he is averaging 15.0 attempts in wins, and 17.9 in losses (with a staggering 4.2 3point attempts per game in losses, on a godawful *28% shooting*, compared to only 2.4 attempts per game in wins).

Now, let's get deeper into this.  I pulled up all of Butler's game logs from the past 2 season.  Last season, when Butler attempted 15 or more shots (he averaged 15.4 on the season), the Bulls were 16-22.  Or, to put it another way, they were 26-20 in games in which Butler attempted 15 or fewer shots, including the games in which he never played.

This season, this trend has only grown starker.  I upped the over under to 16, as Butler is averaging 16.5 shots a game.  In games in which Butler takes 16 or more shots, the Bulls are 6-11.  In games in which Butler takes fewer than 16 shots, we are 11-6.

Now, I can hear you saying, but Butler takes more shots because he plays more minutes in losses!  However, this is not actually the case.  It is not so much that Butler is taking more shots because he is playing more minutes, it's that Butler is taking more shots and *it's hurting the team* in losses.

In losses this season, Butler is shooting 41/28/89 in losses (55% true shooting), from 50/42/88 in wins (63% true shooting).  Now, to a certain extent this is to be expected, losses will naturally coincide with a team best player not playing his best.  But that's not the full story of what's going on here.

In wins, Butler averages 4.7 assists.  In losses, 3.9.  And it's not just that people aren't hitting shots, he's generating fewer assist opportunities in losses as well, which means he's passing less.  Both his OFF and DEF ratings plummet in losses as well, from 135/97 to 113/114 (i.e., a negative worth player in losses).  ***And then the kicker--Butler's usage rate skyrockets in losses, from 25.2% in wins, to*** **29.3%** ***in losses.***

In other words, not only does Butler become wildly inefficient in losses, he also becomes more selfish and ball dominant in losses.  He's hurting us in losses, and then he's doubling down on that worse play and trying to do too much with it.","The Bulls are a better team the fewer shots Jimmy Butler takes Remember [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/5cfj5x/the_doug_mcdermott_effect_or_doug_needs_to_get/) I made a while back?

"First off, this post is in direct response to all of the negativity on the sub today.  Not gonna lie, a lot of it is warranted.  This team should not have been destroyed by the Bucks two games in a row.  

But we all know how our front office and owner are.  They're not going to care if we aren't winning so long as the money keeps coming in.  This is old news.

For all of the posts about blowing up the team right now, do you really think that's going to happen?  With GarPax's history, there's little reason to believe we'll see a major shakeup.  Besides, if it were going to happen, it would've happened last season when we traded away Derrick and let Jo walk.  The Bulls are not in a position to go through a major rebuild.  Even if we trade away Jimmy for picks (which is a dumb idea at this point), we're still not as bad as some of the worst teams in the league.  This team is a mess of parts that will still somehow only get a late lottery pick.  Is it really worth tanking for to get what, the seventh or eighth pick?  

The goal of the current ownership kind of makes sense.  Try to develop young guys and hope we hit it big in free agency.  If we blow it up, that plan goes out the window.  Nobody will want to sign here for years to come.  Like will it show to free agents that we signed Wade to bring him home to a non-playoff team?   

Sorry for the rant.  It's just that we're complaining as if GarPax haven't put us through crap before.  We know how they run things, and its not likely that we see any major changes.  All we can do is be like the Bears right now and just weather the storm.

"I've seen a rash of blaming the ""hero ball"" for why we are losing in the 4th quarter. So I wanted to check the stats and see if that was the full reason...

In the 4th quarter over the last 10 games -

Bench: 5.2 points in 5.4 minutes on 22.8% shooting, 12.5% 3P shooting, 1.5 FT at 75%.

Starters: 14.4 points in 6.6 minutes on 37.6% shooting, 24% 3P shooting, 5 FT at 80%.

So as you can see. Our starters are actually averaging about 104PPG, 26 a quarter in the 4th. It's not that efficient, but 48% TS compared to 30% off the bench in those first 5 minutes.

Our bench averages 49 per100 possessions based on the 4th quarter. FORTY NINE.

The bench is minus 3.3 in 5 minutes. 

The starters are minus 2.2 in 7 minutes. So they are still minus, but it's obvious that the bench blows it big time, then the starters come in and try to mount a comeback which isn't working. The other team also ends up having all the momentum.

#Tl;DR Our bench is killing us in the 4th quarter in the first 5 minutes, then our starters come in and try their best. We need to alter lineups to have some starters run early in 4th to help if our bench won't fix.#","The Bulls bench is killing the 4th quarter, NOT the starters...

"Then you look at guys like Mcdermott, Niko, and Valentine they need certain systems they need to be in to succeed. McDermott thrives in a fast-paced system with ball movement and unselfishness and with the Bulls it's inexistent. You look at the second game of the season when Doug had 23 points. The ball was moving and the ball wasn't sticking and the Bulls continued to find Doug wide open for three and Doug made them pay by knocking down his open looks and he ran the fast break extremely well. Doug has shown he can score and there's no doubt about his ability and his defense improving. He's more than a shooter and has shown a noticeable improvement on both ends he has shown flashes/potential of his scoring/shooting. Put Doug in the right system and with the RIGHT coach and he will thrive maybe like the Clippers, Rockets, Hawks, or even Suns.

With Niko, he had potential it was there it was just a question whether he could put it all together but he hasn't and it's been his third year but he still is a wildly inconsistent player with his shooting and scoring. For a PF he is very quick and his ability to put the ball was really eye catching for his size but his lack of BBIQ and decision making is holding him back IMO like shot selection, careless TO and etc. I think Niko's game is more relied on putting the ball on the floor rather then shooting three's but he has some range from three. If Niko could just take better shots from three that three-point percentage wouldn't be where it's at right now. People have said going to a team like the Spurs with their system can really help him which I agree with.

Valentine has so many questions his athleticism is beyond poor and his defense has not been much better and his shooting hasn't been there. Though I do give Valentine this as he is a smart IQ player and has an overall great feel for the game. Though I really wasn't a fan of the pick cause his ATH is so concerning and will limit him a lot in terms of what he can do. I really wanted someone like Wade Baldwin, Deytona Davis, Chinanu Onuaku, or Tyler Ulis. I don't hate Valentine by any means but his lack/no athleticism is a red flag for me. Valentine has played limited minutes so it's unfair to judge Valentine right now but he needs to start producing ASAP.

"I posted this in the highlights thread, but nobody seems to comment on those, and I'm interested in what everybody else thinks about this.

Disclaimer: I really like Jimmy G Buckets. He's an emerging star, and I'm glad he's on the Bulls. But he seems determined to prove how good he is every time he has the ball.

As good as his stat line from last night is (27/9/6, 3 stl, 1 blk) I didn't like Jimmy's performance in this game at all. I'd say he was actually a big part of the Bulls losing this one.

When he plays within the flow of the game Jimmy looks great, but there's way too many examples of him refusing to involve his teammates, and it becomes a game of 'how many unnecessarily tough shots can Jimmy hit tonight?'.

I know he's capable of scoring tough shots 1-on-1, but that shouldn't be the go-to offense for half the game. Perfect example, in the video below Jimmy muscles the ball into the paint, and scores on a very difficult reverse amongst three defenders. It's impressive, but if he had any inclination to share the ball he would've seen Doug open, waving for a much simpler 3 in the corner. But he never even considered it. I know he made the shot, but the highlights video doesn't show all the times Jimmy tried to bull his way through a double team in this game and lost the ball.

Tl;dr - Jimmy needs to play team ball. He got a good stat line last night but contributed to a Bulls loss :(

"There's been an argument that the Bulls is one of the worst teams in the league when it comes to the 4th quarter and I've looked at some data to see if the Bulls are indeed one of the worst in the league when it comes to 4th quarter scoring and closing out games. 

You can reference here - https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/4th-quarter-points-per-game

Overall, the team is averaging **23 4th quarter points** so far in the season which ranks **28th** in the league. The past 10 games average however is a bit more alarming as the Bulls only averages **20** points per game which is already lower than the season overall. This is also already below the season average they've had last year with 24.9 points per game.

As for the team average scoring margin, the Bulls are also currently **28th** in the league with **a -2.3 average in the 4th**. If you combine this with their current scoring efficiency and the inconsistent defense in the 4th then the argument of the Bulls being one of the worst in the 4th quarter becomes more and more valid.

Another wild stat that I've noticed is that **the Bulls currently rank 7th in the league in terms of biggest lead averages with 14.7 points**. This makes me even more sad as these leads more often tend to disappear in the 2nd half or in the 4th quarter.

Another wild stat that I've wanted to bring up is the team average margin through 3 quarters where the Bulls rank **6th** in the league with +5.4. This means that the Bulls have been usually playing well for the first three quarters UNTIL the dreaded 4th. Another example where the 4th quarter issues starts to show.

It's still fairly early in the season and we're still not yet halfway through the season so there's still a lot of time to correct and improve on certain aspects of the game. What do you guys think?","The Bulls 4th Quarter is the new Turd Quarter There's been an argument that the Bulls is one of the worst teams in the league when it comes to the 4th quarter and I've looked at some data to see if the Bulls are indeed one of the worst in the league when it comes to 4th quarter scoring and closing out games.

In addition to him being fairly young, he is a good athlete and athletic. I would love to see the bulls pull the trigger on a deal to acquire him.

"Hey guys,

### The Great Flair Purge of  2016

I know it's late but I did a few edits to the sub and finished the purge of the flairs and added a few different ones, more still to come (biggie bagel & company, etc...). I added some that were hidden previously (Space Jam, Tune Squad,...) :)

I just thought I'd let you guys know, also purged a lot of the old ones like Tony Snell (RIP, sorry buddy) and also removed old players from selection. If you had it selected before the purge, it'll still show up don't worry but you won't be able to select in the future (I'm still debating bringing them back or not, we'll see).

### Moderating the Night Shift

The second part of this SotS is that we're looking to add potentially one or two new moderators. The twist though is that we'd be looking exclusively at European mods to help us bridge the gap of our ""night shift"" as we refer it which is the time when North America is asleep that way we can maintain a moderating presence during the night and make sure we can monitor the sub 24 hours a day basically or at least get close to it. We've had a few mods with less active time than usual but they're slowly coming back so, I don't see the need to add more mods from the US (sorry guys).

We will be posting a thread about this real soon where you can actually post your applications, in the meantime I guess you can get your resume ready to submit ;)

Thanks again for reading and being one of the most active community on Reddit. GO BULLS!

Enjoy,

"It pains me to say this. Because I also thought our bench would be good during offseason.

But what happened? Niko turned into Eurotrash. Bobby looks like a D league bench player. Canaan can't hit a shot... and Doug and MCW are injured.

This hurts, but what we're missing is Moore and Holiday. Those two players are EXACTLY what we need off the bench right now. If we had them I almost guarantee 3 more wins already.

We can only hope we make a trade, Felicio develops well, and Valentine gets minutes to develop well also. And that Doug and MCW come back strong, or I see us missing the playoffs.","What we're missing... It pains me to say this. Because I also thought our bench would be good during offseason.

"I posted this on a Chicago Bulls fan page on Facebook (Die-Hard Chicago Bulls Fans) and the question at hand was to defend or bash on Nikola Mirotic? This was my opinion on the matter:

Niko if anything has gotten worse when it comes to BBIQ. Every time I see him shoot he's 3-5 feet behind the arc and shooting it flat. He has no patience anymore and thinks that if he's at the three point line and he's passed the ball he has to chuck up a shot. He has no post game whatsoever so the opposing team knows he's only going to be looking to shoot from the perimeter, hence him shooting way too far from three this season. His shot has no arc to it, is very flat now, his shooting mechanics are not that great imo. Maybe it's the role he's being pressured into or something but he isn't doing anything beneficial for us.

I was hoping he would have played well to get the starting spot over Gibson so that Taj could lend his leadership and hustle to the bench, especially with Lopez at the 5 anchoring the defense for the starters, but Niko has played very poorly, and isn't doing anything worthwhile on the offensive end to help the bench unit's lack of scoring when realistically he was supposed to be our main option off the bench besides McDermott.

If at all possible the Bulls need to seriously consider trading him for a good power forward/center that can defend. Obviously the best option would be to go after Nerlens Noel, given he's healthy, even though he is on his last year of his contract because Niko is not our PF of the future. Niko was a spanish-league MVP, Spanish Kings Cup MVP, and FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship MVP. Why is he not progressing after 3 years in the NBA. He hasn't put size or muscle on his frame so he can't defend big bruiser 4's and he's too slow to defend the 3's in our league. He's just been massively dissapointing, and this season is really showing.","My opinion of Nikola Mirotic thus far...

"I try to distinguish these posts from my [""notably bad performances"" posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/5gf5eh/notably_bad_performances_from_12316/) on /r/nba, because often the performances I highlight from the Bulls game aren't notably bad, just lesser.  Today, though, they were notably bad.  I narrowed it down to Grant, Portis, Mirotic, and Rondo because Hunter and Zipser did not play enough minutes to qualify, Valentine is a rookie, and I don't expect much from Felicio in limited minutes.  I'm just going to repeat what I said on today's r/nba post:

Jerian Grant, Bobby Portis, Nikola Mirotic, and Rajon Rondo had bad games for the Bulls in their embarrassing loss to the Mavs. In Wade's absence, Grant received more playing time, but did not do much with it. Bobby Portis has been very disappointing all year, and did not play against the Cavs at all, but on the second night of a back to back on the road he received substantial minutes, and played badly, with 4 points, 5 rebounds, 0 assists, and 3 turnovers. Nikola Mirotic only played 13 minutes, but that's notable because he was supposed to contend for a starting position this year, or at least function as the Bulls' sixth man, but instead but instead scored 0 points, and couldn't even stay in the game. Rondo was the worst of all, though, following his best game of the year against Cleveland with his worst game of the year against Dallas: 2 points, 2 rebounds, 2 assists, and 5 turnovers. Just when we thought he was getting better....

"Hoiberg played his starters long minutes last night.  Wade is not flying to Dallas.  Let's hope they can still beat a bad Mavs team.

The starters all played well and scored 98 points.  The bench scored 13.  Canaan scored 9 but still shot 1 of 5 from three.  Mirotic grabbed some rebounds and played some nice defense late in the game but shot 1 for 9 and scored 2 points.  Grant and Valentine barely played.  Bobby Portis was noticeably absent.  This really was a playoff rotation.

"In the Clippers, Nuggets, and now Lakers losses... each game had a blown call while the game was within 1 point with under 2 minutes left.

Each time resulting in a full on 2-4 point swing.

In the Clippers it was the uncalled Blake Griffin travel that resulted in a 3 or 4 point game.

In the Nuggets it was the missed call on Jimmy's drive, while a 1 point game. Then the missed charge call right after.

In the Lakers it was a missed hand check on Ingram on Jimmy's drive while a 1 (or 2) point game.

We had other reasons to lose... but this is actually ridiculous. I don't remember this many blown calls against us in the final 2 minutes that actually affected the outcome so directly the entire year last year.

We quite literally may have won all 3 of those games without those blown calls. That is 3 losses in a row that can be put in big part on the refs.

Does the team have recourse? This may have a huge affect on the end of year, and how discouraging to consistently lose close games due to the refs.

I generally move on from the officiating, but 3 losses in a row can be put in the refs lap at least at a 50% responsibility and that is ridiculous.","With the last 2 minute report from last night... 3 straight losses with blown calls.

"It's easier to list the players who did not have lesser games for the Bulls last night -- Rondo, Lopez, and Gibson.  I'm holding Butler and Wade to higher standards, but to be fair, the Lakers did a great job of shutting them down with double teams and packing the paint, judging correctly that the rest of the Bulls could not beat them, even if wide open.  As Stacey King said, this is going to be a blueprint for the league, and the Bulls need to adjust.

Isaiah Canaan was particularly bad because he was often the guy left open on the double teams, yet he couldn't hit his shots, and when Canaan isn't hitting his shots, he has little else to offer.  This is not like him and Hoiberg seems determined to let Canaan shoot his way out of this slump -- although Hoiberg has little choice until Doug McDermott returns.  Canaan was 1 for 5 from three; Mirotic 0 for 4; Butler 1 for 6; Wade, Valentine, and Grant each 0 for 1.  Rondo actually hit 2 of 3, but we can't count him sustaining that.

The Bulls also lost the rebounding battle, which is unusual for them.  The Lakers grabbed 60 rebounds, with Randle alone getting 20.  Granted, many of those were off of his own misses, but still, he kept getting them, including 9 offensive rebounds.

Butler probably blew any chance at player of the month in the East (pretty sure it goes to LeBron now) but Butler and the rest of the Bulls have a chance to redeem themselves against the Cavs on Friday.  And the Cavs are having problems of their own, with J.R. Smith in a slump and LeBron coming off a rare bad game against the Bucks.  They will be on the second game of a back to back, too, so let's hope the Clippers give them a good game tonight.

[NBA](http://www.nba.com/powerrankings) - 5th

> The Bulls went 4-2 on the final circus trip, though they might want a redo on Tuesday's final offensive possession in Denver, in which they drew up a play for an Isaiah Canaan airball. Of course, it's not like Jimmy Butler (4-for-17) and Dwyane Wade (3-for-13) have shot well in clutch situations. Canaan's shot hasn't been the only issue with their bench of late, as they've been outscored by 31 points in 34 minutes with Jimmy Butler off the floor in their last three games. Their bench has been better at home than on the road and they now play nine of their next 12 games at the United Center.

> How perfect. The Bulls have only one game left this month: Wednesday night's date with the Lakers. The same Lakers who stand as the only team that can realistically deny Jimmy Butler & Co. from being crowned November's Biggest Surprise Team. Chicago awoke Monday on a short list of three teams, alongside only Golden State and the L.A. Clippers, that find themselves in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive efficiency -- as predicted by absolutely no one.

The Bulls just went 4-2 on their final Circus road trip, with the two losses being by a total of 10 points.

> ""He's just been a very vocal leader,"" Robin Lopez said of Wade, via Josh Martin of Bleacher Report. ""He picks and chooses when to say something, and when he does, it's usually of significant importance.""

> Mostly harmonious and rebounding well, Chicago continues to outperform expectations. If the Bulls want their strong play to continue, they might consider minimizing Rajon Rondo's role. Chicago has been nearly nine points per 100 possessions better when he is on the bench.

> They may not finish the season (or the calendar year) ranked ahead of the Hawks and Hornets, but the Bulls deserve to keep their spot for now.

"Butler and Wade played like stars, and Rondo played one of his better games.  Taj Gibson was his dependable self, not great but not bad, either.  Bobby Portis had one of his better games, which isn't saying much, but it's saying something.  

Robin Lopez, however, had one of his worst games.  Nikola Mirotic didn't have one of his worst games, but only because he's had some horrid games.  Mirotic played about as badly as Lopez; I was hoping for more from both.  

Isaiah Canaan continues to struggle from three, and when he's struggling from three he doesn't bring much to the table.  He's shooting .310 from three for the season, and shot .286 from three against the Sixers, 2 of 7.  Valentine is a rookie, but still, he's doing precious little to earn the 10 or so minutes per game Hoiberg is giving him.  Valentine's true shooting percentage is .416, truly awful.  

Grant, Hunter, and Felicio barely got to play despite the blowout score, which is probably why they all played in the Windy City Bulls' D-League game on Saturday.  But when they did play at the end of the fourth quarter, they did nothing to distinguish themselves, as the Sixers went on a 14-2 run.

"There were arguments about Bulls' offense flow especially when Rondo was on the court there were people saying Bulls had better flow when Canaan was on the floor. As an overseas fan I can't help but miss a lot of games. But from those that I have watched and from stats and highlights I feel like Rondo started to fit in more. He is always leading the team in rebounds and assists, altough he is not scoring a lot, he is an inside threat, teams are working hard to not give him an oppurtunity to drive to the hoop which helps us get open shots. He has great court vision and plays with a selfless mindset. 

I think the biggest problem was getting used to the new group, wade wasn't looking that good in the first couple of games as well to be honest. As a team it looks like we are taking better care of the ball, everyone seems to be playing more efficiently. I dont think we need a new point guard, i dont think canaan should start over Rondo, and I believe we right now have one of the strongest Big Threes on the leauge.

"1) Doug McDermott. We need him back. Holy hell do we need him back. This relates to #2. But seriously, our only bench scorers are Canaan and Niko. 

Grant, Bobby, Felicio, MCW can't be relied on for a consistent shot.

This makes Doug HUGE. He is the key. In the 24-0 run yesterday, yes the 24 is bad. Really bad... but you know why they scored 24? Because we scored 0. Bad offense or good defense more often than not leads to easy buckets the other way. 

2) Bobby/Felicio. This part is tricky. When Doug and MCW come back, it will be less of a glaring problem in my opinion, because of the above point. When our bench can produce offense more consistently, it will be less problematic.

That being said, Felicio should come in and play purely for defense and a big body on rebounds. Or we have to make a trade.

3) The end of games. Look, we've had some struggles to end games. We're 3-2 on the circus trip, and Denver was a high altitude 3rd game in 4 nights. Right now despite it all, we're a couple possessions for a 5-0 circus trip. Seriously. I've been to ever Denver game the last 5 years. It's usually over by the end of the 3rd quarter.

That being said, I'll go back to Doug. He needs to be in place of Canaan to end games. He's more consistent but also not just a 3 point threat.

And we need to let Jimmy handle the ball more as he did in LA to close it out.

Tl;Dr Our team has a lot of bright spots. Doug McDermott at this point is really important, we lack shooters, we knew that coming in, and the offensive threat Doug brings (and he was playing extremely well before going down with injury 12ppg off the bench) can't be overstated. It also will vastly help our rotations.","The keys moving forward, as an optimist. 1) Doug McDermott. We need him back. Holy hell do we need him back. This relates to #2.

"Taj Gibson has been with the Bulls for his entire career (7 years). The man who brings his hard hat and lunch pail every day is now the longest-tenured Bull, but he is never really given his just due. Carlos Boozer started in front of him for a number of seasons. [He was robbed of the Sixth Man of the Year award in 2014](http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/taj-gibson-falls-just-short-kia-nba-sixth-man.html). He has taken his turn as the ""guy we should trade"" numerous times. 

Gibson has been underappreciated and underutilized for a good chunk of his career. He plays with fantastic energy, but he has never really been a fan favorite like other members of the Bulls' bench mob.  Gibson was drafted as a 24-year-old that had a high floor and low ceiling, so there wasn't much hype surrounding his rookie season. There's no doubt he has been the Bulls' most consistent and reliable big man since being drafted in 2009, despite the fact that he has started in just 34% of his games played.  

Gibson is finally a full-time starter. Taj has started all 15 games this season. He seems to be loving his role as an elder statesmen on Bulls team with plenty of young guys.
This is a contract year for Taj Gibson, and it wouldn't be surprising if Gar/Pax decided against re-signing a 32-year-old power forward who can't make three-pointers. 

Gibson is the final relic of the Chicago Bulls' post-Jordan peak in 2010. Since Taj Gibson landed in Chicago: Kirk was traded, Luol was traded, Boozer was amnestied, Thibs was fired, Kirk was traded again, Rose was traded, and Jo left. It is rare for one player to spend his entire career with one franchise, and this could be Taj's final season with the Bulls.
So, let's take some time to recall some of his best moments with the Bulls (please post your own in the comments). . .

"This game was essentially lost in the first three and a half minutes of the second quarter, when the Nuggets went on a 22-0 run.  Hoiberg started the quarter with Portis, Valentine, Mirotic, Canaan, and Wade.  After a 9-0 run for the Nuggets, he substituted Rondo for Valentine.  After a 7-0 run for the Nuggets, he substituted Gibson for Portis.  After a 6-0 run for the Nuggets, he substituted Butler for Canaan.  But the damage had been done.  [Here's the Popcorn Machine GameFlow.](http://popcornmachine.net/gf?date=20161122&game=CHIDEN)

During that 22-0 run, Canaan and Portis played awful defense and were each 0-2 on offense, Valentine played awful defense and didn't shoot at all. Canaan finished the night 1 for 6 from the field with no assists and one rebound, Portis 0 for 3 with no assists and one rebound, and Valentine 0 for 1 with 1 assist and three rebounds.  Canaan played 18 minutes with a plus/minus of -22, Portis 8 minutes with a plus/minus of -9, and Valentine 14 minutes with a plus/minus of -9.

Valentine is a rookie.  Portis is in his second year but is younger than Valentine.  Both could develop.  Canaan is what he is, some Bulls fans have overhyped him but if he's not hitting his three, he's pretty useless.  Right now he's not hitting too often, sporting a .314 3P%, the worst of his career.  I hope he snaps out of it, but it's very frustrating.

All that being said, despite the poor play of these three players this was a close loss to a team that has a tremendous home court advantage (due to altitude) and has played well at home lately.  The Nuggets are a deep team with a lot of young talent.  Mudiay didn't do much for them, but Murray(19) had a great game, and Nurkic (22) and Jokic (21) both had good games.  The Nuggets have figured out that Nurkic and Jokic can't play together in a twin towers line up, because neither of them can play power forward.

Generated 11/23/2016.","Lesser performances from 11/22/16 (Portis, Canaan, Valentine) This game was essentially lost in the first three and a half minutes of the second quarter, when the Nuggets went on a 22-0 run.  Hoiberg started the quarter with Portis, Valentine, Mirotic, Canaan, and Wade.  After a 9-0 run for the Nuggets, he substituted Rondo for Valentine.  After a 7-0 run for the Nuggets, he substituted Gibson for Portis.  After a 6-0 run for the Nuggets, he substituted Butler for Canaan.  But the damage had been done.  [Here's the Popcorn Machine GameFlow.](http://popcornmachine.net/gf?date=20161122&game=CHIDEN)

During that 22-0 run, Canaan and Portis played awful defense and were each 0-2 on offense, Valentine played awful defense and didn't shoot at all. Canaan finished the night 1 for 6 from the field with no assists and one rebound, Portis 0 for 3 with no assists and one rebound, and Valentine 0 for 1 with 1 assist and three rebounds.  Canaan played 18 minutes with a plus/minus of -22, Portis 8 minutes with a plus/minus of -9, and Valentine 14 minutes with a plus/minus of -9.

Valentine is a rookie.  Portis is in his second year but is younger than Valentine.  Both could develop.  Canaan is what he is, some Bulls fans have overhyped him but if he's not hitting his three, he's pretty useless.  Right now he's not hitting too often, sporting a .314 3P%, the worst of his career.  I hope he snaps out of it, but it's very frustrating.

All that being said, despite the poor play of these three players this was a close loss to a team that has a tremendous home court advantage (due to altitude) and has played well at home lately.  The Nuggets are a deep team with a lot of young talent.  Mudiay didn't do much for them, but Murray(19) had a great game, and Nurkic (22) and Jokic (21) both had good games.  The Nuggets have figured out that Nurkic and Jokic can't play together in a twin towers line up, because neither of them can play power forward.

Niko has his games but his offensive game is all over the place but defensively he's better the what people say and a decent defensive rebounder but he's a wild card cause you really don't what to expect from him game to game.

Willie Cauley-Stein for Isaiah Canaan and Bobby Portis. Portis hasn't been great but he's young and teams will be willing to take Portis. I think Portis has potential but he's extremely raw right now and needs to develop though I think in time I think he can develop into a productive player and then Canaan cause he is like Arron Brooks and just isn't a good player IMO he hasn't really impressed me. WCS also has potential but he's not playing big minutes in SAC it's hard to develop when your not getting minutes but he would also be an upgrade on the bench young and athletic Center.

"So assuming Rondo gets waived by the Bulls FO, I wanted to take a look at the available free agents, and our likelihood of acquiring them. I'm not much of a basketball expert, so I apologize if I get anything wrong. Let's start:

* Steph Curry:  Highly unlikely we get him. Don't really have the money, and he will most likely resign with GSW. 

* Jrue Holiday: Not a bad pick up if we could get him. Plus, he may go under the radar due to the other PG's before him. Injuries could be a problem.

* George Hill: I like this. I feel like hill can fit our system pretty well and also add some depth with his shooting ability. 

* Jeff Teague: Not sure he leaves the Pacers, but it could happen if they don't make a good playoff run. I see them pulling their shit together after a slow start. That said, he'd be a good pick up.

* Derrick Rose: Ah, good ol' D. Rose. Sadly for many fans, I highly doubt he returns to the Bulls. Doesn't really fit our system, and wouldn't make sense to sign him back.

* Chris Paul: I think he has an early termination clause where he can be a free agent at the end of this season. That said, it would be amazing if we could get Chris Paul and start the banana boat here in Chicago. His salary would cripple us a bit, but we would have to see how the FO would work our roster to fit him in. Maybe they could get it done.

* MCW: Love him. Hope he resigns.

* Derrick Rose: Ah, good ol' D. Rose. Sadly for many fans, I highly doubt he returns to the Bulls. Doesn't really fit our system, and wouldn't make sense to sign him back.

* Chris Paul: I think he has an early termination clause where he can be a free agent at the end of this season. That said, it would be amazing if we could get Chris Paul and start the banana boat here in Chicago. His salary would cripple us a bit, but we would have to see how the FO would work our roster to fit him in. Maybe they could get it done.

* MCW: Love him. Hope he resigns. 

Im missing some dudes, but I got too lazy to continue with this. It's a pretty stacked draft so I would be dissappointed if we couldn't land one of *these* guys.

"He's almost Brooks level bad in terms of playing selfish and looking for his own shot. It seems like half the time he has the ball, he waives off whatever offensive set they were running and starts doing his own iso which ultimately either ends up in him chucking up a bad shot or passing off to someone with a few seconds left on the shot clock. I'm really glad Fred benched him and played Valentine/Canaan more yesterday cause in the 5 minutes he played, he was -16 on the +/- which is pretty bad in a 8 point win. I really think if he starts to play within his strengths (defense, slashing, pick n rolls), he can be a great role player but someone's gotta convince him that he's not Kobe.","Is anyone else getting increasingly frustrated by Jerian Grant?

"TL;DR: There weren't any.  Yes, Cristiano Felicio didn't do much, but he only played 2 minutes.  Jerian Grant didn't do much, but he only played 5 minutes.  Denzel Valentine, didn't do a lot, but he did enough that it was his best game of the year, and he's a rookie.  Bobby Portis didn't do a lot, but it was an average game from him, and remember that he's two years younger than Valentine.  I could go on, but you get the idea, it was a good game all around for the Bulls.

[Here's the Popcorn Machine Gameflow.](http://popcornmachine.net/gf?date=20161120&game=CHILAL)  The Bulls played badly at the end of the first quarter and the beginning of the second, when the second unit was in.  But second unit players Isaiah Canaan had a great game, and Hoiberg left him in during most of the second half to close out the game.  Robin Lopez and Nikola Mirotic also had good games, especially on the boards, with Lopez grabbing 11 rebounds in 28 minutes and Mirotic grabbing 15 rebounds in 37 minutes.

Now the Bulls visit the Nuggets in Denver, where high altitude gives them a tremendous home court advantage.  I treat this like a back to back on the road even though it isn't back to back -- the altitude makes a huge difference.  Maybe Wade should rest again, but he'll likely play.  The Nuggets are on a bit of a roll, winning two against the Suns and Jazz and losing to the Raptors in a close overtime game.  But the Bulls are on a roll of their own, going 3-1 in the West with only a close loss to the Clippers.  It should be a good game.

"I know we're so early in to the season but would sitting Rondo on the bench and playing him as backup make more sense?

Canaan is a much better fit next to Jimmy and Dwyane and opens up the floor for them both. In terms of our best five man units, the best ones with more than 25 possessions played is:

1. Regular starters but Grant as PG  
2. Regular starters but Canaan as PG

These two lineups are the Bulls best lineups with Butler involved.

There isn't enough data yet with Rondo playing with our bench players but he'd benefit them a lot more rather than Canaan or Grant. 

McDermott's points have come from an assist 86% of the time for 2Pt and 100% for 3s. Mirotic isn't that far behind with 58% and 95% of his shots coming from assists.

Surely the idea of Rondo using his pass-first abilities for the bench would give a lot nore confidence to these players and increase their development while not hindering our ball handling stars.

Canaan or Grant should be starting due to ho well theyve played with our four other starters while Rondo should be developing and increasing confidence in our youth players on the bench.

Win-win?

"I know everyone's talking about Hoiberg's decision to play Portis down the stretch, and yes, that did not work out.  But Jimmy Butler can't feel good about his performance, because that game was there for the taking, and Butler had one of his worst performances of the year, without the excuse of playing a back-to-back.  Yes, he was still above league average, but the Bulls need more from him, and it was sad to see the Bulls waste a great performance by Wade, and a decent performance from Rondo.  

Mirotic had a horrible shooting night and once again he can't seem to find a way to contribute when his three point shot isn't falling.  He had a horrible game, and yet it was not his worst game of the year, not even his second worst.  When he entered the league I had hoped he would develop an NBA body over time, but he hasn't, he still isn't strong enough to bang down low, or he just doesn't like it, and that makes him a one trick pony.  Because defenders know that, they play him for the three, and he has to shoot 5 feet behind the line to get it off -- which of course kills his accuracy.  He needs to play on the line and drive by his defender when they are too aggressive.

That being said, give major credit to the Clippers' defense and depth and coaching.  They decided to put their best defenders on Butler, not Wade, and they made the right decision.  The Clippers did not panic when the Bulls built a huge lead, they kept chipping away.  They did not tire despite playing just the night before.  And the Clippers' bench was better than the Bulls' bench.  In particular, the Bulls had no answer for Marreese Speights in the fourth quarter.

"Well, it only took one game for Jerian Grant to come back to earth.  2 for 10 plus a couple of free throws for 6 points, 1 assist and 1 turnover, 5 rebounds and 2 steals.  Maybe Rondo could do better than that.

Our other point guard, Isaiah Canaan, wasn't much better, with 4 for 9 shooting for 8 points, 0 assists and 2 turnovers, 2 rebounds and 1 steal.

I know Denzel Valentine is a rookie but if he keeps getting 15 minutes a night I have to note that he did very little with it, 1 of 3 shooting for 3 points, 1 rebound, 1 assists, and 3 fouls (a foul every five minutes is not good).  Fortunately, it did not cost us the game.  Let's hope he benefits from the playing time.

Bobby Portis continues to make me wonder if Cristiano Felicio would not be better, but I did not add him to the dishonor roll despite his 0 rebounds.  He did make 1 three and 2 free throws for 5 points in 10 minutes, and also had 1 assist and 1 block.  Considering how much trouble the Bulls had scoring in this game, that was helpful.

Honestly, no one had a great game other than Butler, and even he was more good than great on offense, but the defense came through, they were fighting the altitude, and Wade hit some clutch shots, so I'll give the rest of the players a break.  A win is a win, despite the second quarter.  Also, [here's the Popcorn Machine GameFlow.](http://popcornmachine.net/gf?date=20161117&game=CHIUTH)

Generated 11/18/2016.","Lesser performances from 11/18/16 (Canaan, Grant, Valentine) Well, it only took one game for Jerian Grant to come back to earth.  2 for 10 plus a couple of free throws for 6 points, 1 assist and 1 turnover, 5 rebounds and 2 steals.  Maybe Rondo could do better than that.

Our other point guard, Isaiah Canaan, wasn't much better, with 4 for 9 shooting for 8 points, 0 assists and 2 turnovers, 2 rebounds and 1 steal.

I know Denzel Valentine is a rookie but if he keeps getting 15 minutes a night I have to note that he did very little with it, 1 of 3 shooting for 3 points, 1 rebound, 1 assists, and 3 fouls (a foul every five minutes is not good).  Fortunately, it did not cost us the game.  Let's hope he benefits from the playing time.

Bobby Portis continues to make me wonder if Cristiano Felicio would not be better, but I did not add him to the dishonor roll despite his 0 rebounds.  He did make 1 three and 2 free throws for 5 points in 10 minutes, and also had 1 assist and 1 block.  Considering how much trouble the Bulls had scoring in this game, that was helpful.

Honestly, no one had a great game other than Butler, and even he was more good than great on offense, but the defense came through, they were fighting the altitude, and Wade hit some clutch shots, so I'll give the rest of the players a break.  A win is a win, despite the second quarter.  Also, [here's the Popcorn Machine GameFlow.](http://popcornmachine.net/gf?date=20161117&game=CHIUTH)

"The way I see it, there are still a few questions to be answered for next year... but if we legitimately wanted to compete.

What would we do?

I see the problem areas as the PF/C position, and the starting PG position.

Between either MCW or Grant I think we can lock down the backup PG. I like what Grant has been showing.

Rondo has been really hit or miss. Great when he shows up, but not consistent yet.

Taj needs to be re-signed 100%. Rolo is locked up.

But we need either another starting caliber PF/C, or a good backup because Bobby/Felicio have been terrible so far, and Niko hasn't been good enough to hold that rotation down.

What do you guys think?

I'm personally in favor of dropping Rondo end of year and pursuing a good PG, but I don't know how realistic the chances of getting one are.","Early season discussion.

"Apparently /r/nba doesn't allow me to post. Maybe it's my love obsession with Jimmy Butler. I've spent all morning arguing with people about how Jimmy is having a top 5-8 season.

Before I dig into the team... here's some stats about Jimmy.

25.9/6.4/4.5/1.9(stl) on 49/45/90. 64% TS.

26.7% Usage/.314 WS per 48/8.3 BPM/1.0 VORP/ORTG 130

P.S. Over the last 4 games 31/7/6.5/3 65.9% TS on 51/47/91.

He's playing better than Derozan, Lillard, and Kawhi. I'd rank him #7 this year so far.

Anyway... now to the team:

I posted many times earlier about how we were winning because of Rebounding and Assists right? 

Well we're still winning because of Rebounding. Assists not so much. With Rondo being very mediocre recently, our assist totals have gone down but our winning hasn't.

Back to #1 Rebounding per game after last night. 

3rd in 2nd chance points.

Last year we had the 2nd best record in the east but the 20th or so point differential. This begets a lack of ability to sustain, winning by small amounts, losing by big amounts.

This year we're 4th in point differential with a positive 7.6. We have more blowout wins than we did all of last year it seems like.

But to point to the main things? Rebounding and Jimmy Butler. He is the #2 more efficient scoring forward in the NBA behind Kevin Durant...

So with that being said, I'm very excited but also want to look at some cold hard facts about the future. I love Rajon Rondo. But I don't know if he has a place on this team.

Additionally, I have my doubts about Nikola Mirotic. With Bobby and Felicio being very poor, our biggest hole is at backup PF/C and Niko isn't enough right now to cover that.

I know it's looking ahead, but this offseason I firmly believe we should let Rondo and Niko go... Re-sign Taj, and go after Blake Griffin or Paul Millsap. We actually could have the cap for it.

Run Grant/MCW on the point, with Canaan/Valentine also capable, we have enough PGs. 

If Rondo turns it around I may change my mind, but our PF/C rotation worries me. We need 3 solid players and right now we only have 2, and they both start.","Your up to date Bulls analysis.... How good/bad are we? Also, roster changes? Apparently /r/nba doesn't allow me to post. Maybe it's my love obsession with Jimmy Butler. I've spent all morning arguing with people about how Jimmy is having a top 5-8 season.

Before I dig into the team... here's some stats about Jimmy.

25.9/6.4/4.5/1.9(stl) on 49/45/90. 64% TS.

26.7% Usage/.314 WS per 48/8.3 BPM/1.0 VORP/ORTG 130

P.S. Over the last 4 games 31/7/6.5/3 65.9% TS on 51/47/91.

He's playing better than Derozan, Lillard, and Kawhi. I'd rank him #7 this year so far.

Anyway... now to the team:

I posted many times earlier about how we were winning because of Rebounding and Assists right? 

Well we're still winning because of Rebounding. Assists not so much. With Rondo being very mediocre recently, our assist totals have gone down but our winning hasn't.

Back to #1 Rebounding per game after last night. 

3rd in 2nd chance points.

Last year we had the 2nd best record in the east but the 20th or so point differential. This begets a lack of ability to sustain, winning by small amounts, losing by big amounts.

This year we're 4th in point differential with a positive 7.6. We have more blowout wins than we did all of last year it seems like.

But to point to the main things? Rebounding and Jimmy Butler. He is the #2 more efficient scoring forward in the NBA behind Kevin Durant...

So with that being said, I'm very excited but also want to look at some cold hard facts about the future. I love Rajon Rondo. But I don't know if he has a place on this team.

Nevertheless, there were some players who could have shown more in substantial minutes.  And it may matter to their future playing time.

Bobby Portis and Isaiah Canaan were not great.  This may mean more Felicio and Grant in the future, we'll see.  Grant certainly made his case for more playing time.  Rookie Denzel Valentine played 16 minutes and it's great that he got that experience, but he didn't do much with it.  

Felicio, Hunter, and Zipser only played 4 minutes.  Good thing Jimmy Butler didn't get injured in his 34th minute or there would have been questions raised about why he wasn't on the bench sooner.

"So the salaries near perfectly match up on this: http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=gq7ub3e

The Kings would receive the veteran and almost all-star player Taj Gibson, plus two up and coming players in Niko Mirotic and Denzel Valentine. The kings need to rebuild so Niko/Valentine would be suitable starting pieces for that.

In return we get the superstar DeMarcus Cousins and instantly become the number 1 contenders in the east. A starting line up of Rondo, Wade, Butler, Cousins, and Lopez, is a superteam. Plus we'd still have a decent bench mob too.

This would be a good trade for both teams.

"The Bulls are relying heavily on Niko and Doug to provide floor spacing around the ""Three Alphas"" and Robin Lopez. However, Niko has struggled to find his shooting rhythm (again) this season. I was watching some of Niko's highlights and I noticed something. When Niko catches on the hop, dips the ball, and shoots quickly in rhythm, the ball almost always goes in. It seems to me that he almost shoots better when he needs to get his shot off more quickly. It's almost like when he gets those wide open threes, with ten feet of space, or when he catches and stares down the basket for a second, that he throws up a total brick. I haven't done any statistical analysis on this, but I was wondering if you guys had noticed this too. If so, why has this seemed to be a problem for Niko's entire career?

"Until the last game it seems like Jimmy has been flying under the radar, I've even seen many claims that he may be the 4th or 5th best SG in the NBA. (Granted he's playing the SF more than he used to right now, but it's really no different to his role in previous years).

First the counting stats, using Per 36 (both players play enough minutes for this to be sensible) -

#Jimmy: 25.7/5.8/4.4/2.1(steals)

#DeMar: 33/4.6/3.1/1.4

By pure counting stats, I give the advantage to Derozan for the start of this year. But when you look at the shooting splits things get a little less clear.

#Jimmy: 48/43/89 with 15.8 FGA/G and 3.9 3P FG/g. 63.6 TS%

#Derozan: 53/21/81 with 23.5 FGA/G. 59.4 TS%

Jimmy is massively winning the efficiency battle. DeRozan shoots almost 8 more shots per game for those extra 8 points. And Jimmy is shooting a whopping 43% from 3 with 4 attempts per game. Another year, another major improvement for Jimmy Butler.

Now let's look at some advanced stats:

#Jimmy: USG 26.6%, Ws/48 .304, BPM +7.6, Vorp .8, Ortg 130, Drtg 105

#Derozan: USG 37.5%, WS/48 .257, BPM +4.1, Vorp .5, Ortg 118, Drtg 108.

With Jimmy's efficiency, the advanced stats obviously absolutely LOVE him, over Derozan. A whopping ORTG of 130 is just ridiculous.

Jimmy Butler is lowkey 2% from a 50/40/90 right now, and it's his 3P shooting that is above that line right now.

Tl;Dr In my opinion, Jimmy Butler is still the clear cut #2 SG, and is one of the most efficient volume scorers in the NBA, while maintaining a relatively low usage rate. He is most likely a top 5 player this year, and he's been getting better as the season goes on.

This is also Jimmy's 6th year, compared to Derozan's 8th. So I'd expect further growth from Jimmy.","Posted this in /r/nba, comparing Jimmy Butler to Derozan this year...

"Dwayne Wade and Rajon Rondo had the lesser performances of the night.

Good win last night, great performance by Jimmy Butler, finally a good performance from Nikola Mirotic.  Taj Gibson was also good, if not great.

However, let's not forget Wall and Beal were not playing for the Wizards.  The Bulls dug a hole in the first quarter and spent the rest of the game catching up, until finally pulling away in the fourth.  Butler looked exhausted by the end.  Fortunately, they don't have a game today.

Robin Lopez played okay, not great, but that's pretty much what I expect from him at this point.  He's steady, never horrible, but also never great.  This was a typical game from him.

I hold Dwyane Wade to higher standards because he's still capable of great games, and this was not a great game.  And this wasn't a back to back on the road, either.  So he really did not have an excuse.

I don't expect much from Isaiah Canaan and he was better than Rondo, so I have no complaints.  Doug McDermott was injured so I'll give him a break and hope he's okay -- head injuries are scary.

Bobby Portis and Jerian Grant played short minutes but did nothing to earn more minutes.  I'm not sure Portis has earned Cristiano Felicio's minutes, but he's getting them.

Rajon Rondo was bad again after a rare good performance in Miami.  This was his worst game of the season, and that's saying something.  One of his ten games was good, four have been about average, four have been bad, but this one was horrible.  Zero for six for zero points, five assists and two turnovers, seven rebounds and five personal fouls.

Generated 11/13/2016.","Lesser performances from 11/12/16 Dwayne Wade and Rajon Rondo had the lesser performances of the night.

Good win last night, great performance by Jimmy Butler, finally a good performance from Nikola Mirotic.  Taj Gibson was also good, if not great.

However, let's not forget Wall and Beal were not playing for the Wizards.  The Bulls dug a hole in the first quarter and spent the rest of the game catching up, until finally pulling away in the fourth.  Butler looked exhausted by the end.  Fortunately, they don't have a game today.

Robin Lopez played okay, not great, but that's pretty much what I expect from him at this point.  He's steady, never horrible, but also never great.  This was a typical game from him.

I hold Dwyane Wade to higher standards because he's still capable of great games, and this was not a great game.  And this wasn't a back to back on the road, either.  So he really did not have an excuse.

I don't expect much from Isaiah Canaan and he was better than Rondo, so I have no complaints.  Doug McDermott was injured so I'll give him a break and hope he's okay -- head injuries are scary.

Bobby Portis and Jerian Grant played short minutes but did nothing to earn more minutes.  I'm not sure Portis has earned Cristiano Felicio's minutes, but he's getting them.

Rajon Rondo was bad again after a rare good performance in Miami.  This was his worst game of the season, and that's saying something.  One of his ten games was good, four have been about average, four have been bad, but this one was horrible.  Zero for six for zero points, five assists and two turnovers, seven rebounds and five personal fouls.

"Wade received a warm reception in Miami, but he didn't play well.  That being said, it was the second night of a back to back on the road, and he played better than he did in Indiana under similar circumstances.  We probably shouldn't expect much of him in such games.

Fortunately, Jimmy Butler and Rajon Rondo had energy, and Rondo had his best game with the Bulls.  Rondo did not suddenly find his shot.  [He hit one three and one shot from the elbow, but did most of his damage near the rim while missing four mid-range shots.](http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/shot-chart/201611100MIA.html)  He also had 12 rebounds, 6 assists, and only one turnover.  Isaiah Canaan, on the other hand, had a bad game in 9 minutes, so I guess it's good that Hoiberg did not bench Rondo for Canaan the way I suggested.  But I wonder how much of Rondo's performance should be credited to Miami's defense, which allowed him to get into the paint.

Taj Gibson did not play up to his usual standards, with only three rebounds.  And Bobby Portis wasn't very good, either.  Fortunately, Robin Lopez, Doug McDermott, and Nikola Mirotic played a little better than usual to provide just enough support for the win.

The Bulls won a game the bettors predicted they would lose.  That makes up for the Knicks loss at home.  So they are performing up to expectations -- albeit, low expectations.  They aren't as bad as teams like the Pacers and Celtics, who are performing well below expectations.  They aren't as good as teams like the Hawks and Hornets, who are performing above expectations.  They are in the middle tier in the East, about where everyone expected.

If they are going to play *better* than expected, they need someone to up his game.  They need the defense to solidify, the young players to get better, the old players to work together, and continued good health.

They have to beat the Wizards at home on Saturday as expected.  Then they have the circus trip, six games on the road.  However, the last game of the trip is not out west, but in Philadelphia, presumably after they sleep in their own beds in Chicago.  That's definitely winnable.  

I think they should be able to pick up one or two other wins as well, maybe go 2-4 or even 3-3.  3-3 would be an excellent result, but even 1-5 shouldn't discourage us, it's a tough task to play six road games in a row.  And it does give the coaches a lot of opportunities to work with the team on the road, where there are fewer distractions.

"Now, as we all know, Doug has been playing very well this season, both offensively, but also surprisingly defensively.  He has an NBA 7th best OFF eff of 128.  And yet, as many have been yelling in recent GDT comment sections, he seems like he really should be getting the ball more.  So I decided to do a quick analysis to see if that's true, and the answer is obvious:  We are a demonstrably better team the more shots Doug McDermott gets.

Now unlike the ball hawks of the league, and of our team, the only way Doug gets touches is if he's passed, and even though he is very capable of putting the ball on the floor and driving off of cuts and screens, he's not going to iso at the top of the key.  31 of his 35 made field goals this season have been assisted, 89%.  In other words, Doug needs his teammates to get him the ball in order to be effective, and that isn't happening as often as it should.  And indeed, this is a continuation of what happened last season.

As we all know, last season was sorely disappointing.  However, if you look at Doug's splits, a very interesting trend emerges.  I pulled all of Doug's game-logs and looked at games where he recorded at least 10 field goal attempts, and then I looked again at where he had at least 9, since there were 29 games in which he had 10+ and 9 more in which he had 9, making it seem like a more natural cut-off point.

In the 38 games last season where Doug put up at least 9 shots, our record was 23-15.  Or, in other words, when he did not, we were 19-25.  And this is not a matter of minutes played either--Doug averaged 22.9 minutes in wins, 23.0 in losses, essentially identical.  I point this out to prevent claims of Doug getting more shots in blow-out wins or losses.  In wins, Doug averaged 8.9 shot attempts per game.  In losses, only 7.0.

And indeed, this trend has only continued this season.  Same story different season. 

Although it is early, so far, in games in which Doug puts up at least 9 shots, we are 4-0, and we are 1-5 when he does not.  In wins, Doug has averaged 9.6 shots attempts this season.  In losses, only 6.0.

In the past two seasons, essentially his first two real seasons, discounting his mess of a rookie year, we are 27-15 when Doug records 9+ shots, and 20-29 when he does not.

Now, does this mean that there is a direct causal link between Doug's shot total and wins?  Of course not, but there is certainly a *very* strong correlation, and one that the team really needs to do a better job exploiting.

We are a demonstrably better team when Doug is putting up shots, even if they are not falling.","The Doug McDermott Effect; or, Doug needs to get the ball more!

"I know everyone hated the Heat, when the big three connived.

&nbsp;

Now everyone hates GSW, because they get not 1, not 2 but(Lebron parody)... 4 primed all-stars.

&nbsp;

But guess what? You will hate GSW more!

&nbsp;

GSW basically have over $51M cap space with Green, Thompson and Curry(cap hold) signed. That's $51M shared between Durant(given he will opted out and take a discount) and Blake Griffin(given he too will take a discount). Ibaka haven't signed an extension with Orlando yet, so Curry, Thompson, Durant(opt-in), Green and Ibaka($20M) isn't shabby at all.

&nbsp;

At this point, I don't think any prime player who has championship aspirations, will go to the West unless it's the Spurs...

&nbsp;

But the Spurs need to Pau Gasol opt out(which I doubt he will) for them to gain cap space.

&nbsp;

So yeah, Blake Griffin and Chris Paul will be expected to go the east. Unless Blake joins up with GSW(which very likely).

&nbsp;

If Bulls renounce Niko and trade RoLo(which I think they would in the off-season), they can clear as much as $50M cap space for two major free agents in 2017 free agency. Wade also has player option, which could be restructured to accommodate CP3.

&nbsp;

With Wade in Chicago, he can lure CP3 here. I don't know about Blake Griffin(as he will get the same discounted money playing for the Bulls and GSW), but just in case his not coming to GSW(which I predict he will) they can trade RoLo to accommodate him here.

&nbsp;

But one thing is certain. D.Wade recruiting CP3 next season is to be expected.

&nbsp;

Cavs don't have cap space to work on, so they're basically limited on improving their team. This is their last year to have a window on winning a championship(as GSW will have an all-star starting five in 2017).

&nbsp;

If Bulls can get CP3 next season, this is their make-up.

&nbsp;

S: CP3, Wade, Jimmy, Niko and RoLo


B: Grant, Zel, McDermott, Felicio and Portis


R: Zipser and two rookies...

&nbsp;

Pretty much enough to beat Lebron and the Cavs in the 2018 playoffs.

&nbsp;

And if they do... We might be talking about Lebron to the Bulls in 2018.

> “My motivation,” James says, “is this ghost I’m chasing. The ghost played in Chicago.”

Surprisingly, Bron said that after Wade signed with Chicago.

&nbsp;

Trading Niko and RoLo in off season of 2018, Bulls would have close to max cap space to sign Lebron.

&nbsp;

Bulls will have CP3, Wade, Jimmy, Lebron and Felicio($6M poison pill) as starters.

&nbsp;

Bench is composed of Grant, Zel, Doug, Zipser and Bobby Portis.

&nbsp;

Our bench would stomp GSW's bench in the finals.

&nbsp;

And the rebounding of this group would be much2x better than GSW.

"Nikola Mirotic had a bad game.  

I know people are complaining about Rondo but last night he did all I want him to do, he didn't absolutely suck.  The same goes for Portis, McDermott, Lopez, and Canaan.  I just don't want them to suck.  Butler, Wade, and Gibson led the way, they had good games.  In garbage time, Felicio, Valentine, Grant, and Zipser weren't good, but I don't count that against them since  they played short, inconsequential minutes.

But Mirotic was bad in substantial minutes.  He was 1 of 6 from three and he had some wide open threes.  And he wasn't that good elsewhere, either.

"# The great flair purge of 2016 is upon us, folks.

I'm currently in the process of removing a lot of old ones or ones that aren't relevant to the team anymore. No worries, the Rose & Noah ones will stay obviously. I'm adding more from our new comers and some surprises here and there.

Another big change is the jersey flairs are slowly going away. I'm doing big numbers now, I'll keep the jersey in my back pocket if I need them back but for now, big numbers, yay!

If you find any bugs, let me know. I know about r/BullsTix header issue and working on it in a minute. I know it's long overdue.

If you have ideas for flairs or for the sub itself, as always feel free to shoot us a message, pm me on Discord or post below.

### Flairs added
- Numbers: 0,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,11,21,22
- Paul Zipser
- Jerian Grant

### Coming soon
- Numbers: 1,16,25,31,44,45,54,91

If you find any bugs, let me know. I know about r/BullsTix header issue and working on it in a minute. I know it's long overdue.

If you have ideas for flairs or for the sub itself, as always feel free to shoot us a message, pm me on Discord or post below.

### Flairs added
- Numbers: 0,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,11,21,22
- Paul Zipser
- Jerian Grant

### Coming soon
- Numbers: 1,16,25,31,44,45,54,91
- Biggie Bagel
- Dashing Donut
- Cuppy Coffee

"I've come up with a line-up that I think the Bulls should try out. Let me know what you think. 

Starters
PG: Wade / Butler, SG: Butler / Wade, SF: McDermott, PF: Gibson,  C: Lopez

Bench
PG: Rondo / MCW / Canaan, SG: MCW / Grant, SF: Valentine, PF: Mirotic / Portis, C: Felicio / Portis

Reasoning:
In this line-up, Rondo would come off the bench early to rest Wade. He's still a starting quality guard, but the current starting line-up with Rondo at PG, Wade at SG, and Jimmy at SF, features too many ball handlers. The stagnation of the ball has been especially evident these past few games, and Rondo's defense has raised some concerns. Wade has proven that he can score, shoot 3's, handle the ball, assist, defend, and get to the line. I like the ball when it's in his hands. I also don't mind the Jimmy isos if the team is struggling to make a bucket. He gets foul calls, and can still clutch. Players are going to go at McDermott on offense, but I think the defense, rim protection, and rebounding from the other starters will help balance that out. If he doesn't hit his shots, Hoiberg could sub him out early for Mirotic at SF. The proposed bench is still a work in progress, so feel free to add feedback on that. I know it's far too early in the season to overreact, and I think Rondo should still be given more games to prove that he can fit with the starters. This is just an experimental line-up that I think could address our scoring, defensive, and ball movement issues.

"As shown on the [Popcorn Machine Game Flow](http://popcornmachine.net/gf?date=20161105&game=CHIIND), this game was not lost because the team got tired due to playing the night before.  Perhaps that's why they didn't mount any kind of comeback, but this game was lost for the same reason as previous two games; the starters came out flat on their heels and gave up more points than they scored in the first quarter.  

The quarter ended with the biggest deficit yet, 16 points.  Much of that was built on 7 first quarter turnovers by the three alphas; 3 by Butler, and 2 each by Rondo and Wade.  Rondo and Wade also contributed no points in that quarter, Rondo on 0-2 shooting and Wade on 0-3 shooting.

Nikola Mirotic had an unusually bad night, while Isaiah Canaan had what is becoming his usual bad night.  (Four of Canaan's six games have been bad so far; if he isn't hitting his three he's bad.)  But I blame the three alphas for this loss, and not because they were tired.  They just sucked.

Wade and Butler did play better against the Knicks when others did not, so the most worrisome player is Rondo, who played badly in both games.  He played okay before that, and okay is good enough, I'm happy with okay.  We can't afford for him to play horribly, though.  Either he need to get more assists or he needs to hit more shots.  When he gets 5 assists and 4 turnovers and 9 points on 4-11 shooting (1-2 from the foul line) like last night, *and* he makes Jeff Teague, who was having a horrible season, look like a star, he's horrible.  If that continues, bring back Carter-Williams and give him the starting job, bring back Dinwiddie, or just give point guard minutes to Valentine and let him learn on the job.

One more thing.  It's kind of scary looking ahead.  8 of the next 10 games are on the road.  We must beat the Magic and Wizards at home, both winnable games, because there's no guarantee we will win any of those 8 road games.

A final word from Wade and then the chart:

>[3 up. 3 down. That's how it goes when you're learning each other. We have a ways to go but the good part is we know it. Back at it Monday.](https://twitter.com/DwyaneWade/status/795089186978234368)

>[3 up. 3 down. That's how it goes when you're learning each other. We have a ways to go but the good part is we know it. Back at it Monday.](https://twitter.com/DwyaneWade/status/795089186978234368)

Again, if you can't read the whole chart, zoom out to 80%.

"On offense Wade was great, Butler was maybe better than you realize.  Mirotic and Gibson could be better but didn't stink.  But the whole team stunk on defense, making the Knicks look great.  

Here's the [Popcorn Machine Game Flow.](http://popcornmachine.net/gf?date=20161104&game=NYKCHI)  The Knicks' starters won this game with an 18-3 run in the first quarter, and 11-4 run in the third quarter, and a 14-2 run in the fourth quarter.  Every Knicks starter had a double-digit positive plus/minus, and every Bulls starter had a negative plus/minus.

This is the first time the betting line was wrong about who would win a Bulls game, and it that's not good news for the Bulls.  Are the Bulls who the pre-season bettors and pundits thought they were?  Well, at least Wade is still hitting his threes.

If you can't read the entire charts, zoom out to 80%.

As I said, Wade keeps hitting his threes.  Also, 11 for 11 from the free throw line led to a sneaky-good performance from Butler.  The best players for the Bulls:

"Hi guys, I used to be a hardcore basketball fan, but I never had a ""team"", I usually just hitched my bandwagon to whatever ball club I fell in love with at a particular time because with the way the NBA is set up, unlike football, there really isn't any hope trying to follow the knicks or the nets, etc. it's a league built on superstars and if your team doesn't have at least two, you aren't going anywhere. 

So I was a fan of a lot of teams in the 2000s, including: Kings, Nets, Suns and, bringing me to my point, the Bulls. 

I hitched myself to your bandwagon the moment Thibs was brought in, I was hoping to land LeBron and Bosh or Wade and Bosh. That didn't happen, but what did end up happening not to long into my ""fan hood"", were rumors of Carmelo Anthony being traded. (There was also that laughable Gibson for Mayo nonsense that I'm glad never materialized), but was it ever true that the reason the deal never happened was that the bulls didn't want to give up Noah?

I can't remember the exact structure of the deal, but can anyone here remember what the alleged proposal was, why it was rejected, and what could have happened if it was accepted?

To my understanding the team had Asik and Butler on the roster at the time, correct? So I assume it would have been Deng and Noah and maybe Gibson for Melo? Or was there some different combination?

What could have been the justification? I always thought that Asik provided similar production to Noah in a lower amount of minutes, minus Noah's ""offensive"" abilities, but that adding a scorer like Anthony would have more than balanced it out. 

And seeing how Butler turned out, couldn't this proposed deal have made the Bulls actual contenders at the time? I don't think they would have beaten the heat, but couldn't this roster have at least taken them to 6 games?

So what happened? 

Did you guys want the trade? To me this was similar to what the Thunder did with choosing Perkins over Harden, the 5 position had been weakening for a substantial period of time and most of these guys were proven to be replaceable, so you always go with the perimeter talent. But it seems that the philosophies at the time disagreed with that.

https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/5ajqwc/a_brief_analysis_of_why_were_winning_and_why_we/

https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/5aqvp6/one_more_post_with_some_further_analytics_of_why/

Talked about why we were winning. So now we lost. Important to see why.

In the game thread/post game it seemed a lot of people were clamoring for why Taj wasn't back in. Why Lopez got so few minutes.

In my posts I explained we were winning because of rebounds and passing. 100%. Those were the keys, those were the things we could control, and those were the strengths of our lineups.

Now our rebounding advantage is more specifically stated as offensive rebounding.

We still won the battle on the boards last night by 10. And had 5 more offensive rebounds. So what happened?

2 things. Taj had a really bad game. The stat sheet says 8 rebounds. Only 3 of those were defensive. And 5 were offensive. Except those 5 were a lot of down under the basket plays where he got the ball and missed a point blank shot, or turned it over.

He shot 3/12 with 8 rebounds in 25 minutes. That won't cut it.

Lopez had a weird night too. He just wasn't good.

So we still won rebounding, but we missed the entire advantage that rebounding gave us. I remember one sequence with Lopez missing about 4 tips in a row. They didn't staticize it with 4 shots and 4 rebounds, but it was.

Additionally, Bobby Portis had a REALLY good night. I don't blame Hoiberg at all, Bobby has looked bad recently. But he had a great night. 2/2 for 4 pts and 7 boards in 11 minutes and he was +7.

Now lets talk assists. You know it's a bad night for your big men when Rondo has more points than assists. I went back and watched my replays. Rondo made a few bad passes, but I counted SIX times where Lopez/Taj or Felicio completely fumbled the ball away and mishandled the pass that would have led to an easy bucket.

That was it. The difference between a win and a loss. The passes were there, the rebounding was there. The execution wasn't.

We fumbled six passes to wide open baskets, and missed at least 4 point blank shots off offensive boards. That's 20 points! Even if you count half of those (and they are high percentage looks) it's a win.

#Tl;dr We still won the rebound battle, and made the passes we needed to make. But all 3 of our main bigs had absolute butterfingers and we lost.

The positives are even with giving up 10 easy baskets we usually convert. Jimmy being in foul trouble for the first time ever. And Amir Johnson turning into D Wade from game 1. We still kept it close and might have won if not for some untimely missed free throws.

If we keep playing our game we will beat the teams we should, and be there in the tough games, and if you beat the team you should, and go 50/50 with the teams you shouldn't, that's as much as you can ask for.","Why we lost, compared to previous why we were winning... Made a couple posts recently:

#Tl;dr We still won the rebound battle, and made the passes we needed to make. But all 3 of our main bigs had absolute butterfingers and we lost.

The positives are even with giving up 10 easy baskets we usually convert. Jimmy being in foul trouble for the first time ever. And Amir Johnson turning into D Wade from game 1. We still kept it close and might have won if not for some untimely missed free throws.

If we keep playing our game we will beat the teams we should, and be there in the tough games, and if you beat the team you should, and go 50/50 with the teams you shouldn't, that's as much as you can ask for.",10,17,"Why we lost, compared to previous why we were winning...",https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/5b04yt/why_we_lost_compared_to_previous_why_we_were/

Overall, I liked the effort we put out there. Keep fighting, keep plugging away.

“Good test for our first tough road game,” Wade added. “There are not too many tougher places to play than here. I’ve been in this gym before where they came out and played the same way and we lost by a lot. We can nit pick everything, but we won’t; just have better effort and take care of the ball more. I said this coming out of preseason: I didn’t know a lot about what was going to happen, but I knew this team had fight. I saw that early in preseason. More times than not you play that way you are going to win more games than you are going to lose.

“You see a team get smacked and fade away and then you see a team get smacked and they want to keep getting smacked and get in your face,” Wade went on. “That’s the kind of group we have. That’s what I liked about this team from afar when we first got together. I know we have some tough guys.

"Even the best performances (the three alphas plus Mirotic) were pretty close to average.  For Jimmy Butler, in particular, that's bad.  

Taj Gibson was below average, surprising from him.  Isaiah Canaan and Denzel Valentine both struggled to back up Rondo.  And I'm worried about Cristiano Felicio, he's been [pretty bad in all four games](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/f/feliccr01/gamelog/2017/), and this was his worst yet.  Some people questioned why Bobby Portis got playing time, but Gibson and Felicio weren't performing, so why not?

If you have trouble reading the charts, zoom out to 80%.

I don't think anyone wanted to say it, but there was real impatience with Derrick Rose because his play did not match his reputation or status as the leader of the team. And it wasn't just about injuries, it was also about buying in to what Hoiberg was selling.

All the praise for Rondo this year can't help but be contrasted to Rose -- Rondo has been described as very vocal, very smart, a coach on the floor, a strong presence in the locker room, getting the ball up the floor quickly, eager to make assists. These are all the things Rose was not doing under Hoiberg, even when healthy.

Now, when the Bulls were clicking the vocal presence was Joakim Noah, but he was struggling with injuries, pushed to the bench, and couldn't really muster the enthusiasm to lead the team. And Pau Gasol was not that guy. And Hoiberg himself wasn't a vocal presence like Thibodeau.

Jimmy Butler tried to fill the void, but Rose and Noah remembered when he was coming off the bench and weren't really comfortable following his lead. Pau wasn't going to change. Nor was Butler familiar with the role of a locker room leader. He was doing something he thought needed doing, but wasn't sure how to do it.

So yes, winning cures everything, but maybe, just maybe, the front office knew what it was doing this summer. There are 79 more games to go, though.","Did Gar/Pax know what they were doing?

"We're still very early in the season at 3 games in but we have seen samples of what this team can do as a group and individually. That said, I've made my own (slightly biased) predictions for this season.

1. Taj Gibson will be in the conversation for the Most Improved Player of the year. Let's take a look at his numbers so far. His current ppg in 3 games is at 14.7ppg in 25.7mpg which is the highest so far he has ever had since '13 where he had 13ppg in 28.7mpg in 82 games. Taj greatly benefits from Rondo and Wade's playmaking passes and if he establishes consistency in his game, these stats can only go upwards. His rebounding numbers are also at 9.7rpg whereas his next best was in his rookie season in '09 at 7.5rpg.

2. Doug McDermott can also get himself in the MIP conversation eventually down the road although the only significant increase in his numbers right now is his PPG which is from 9.4 last year to 13.3 this year. If Doug can improve his rebounding and assist numbers along with the scoring then he can also get nominated for MIP or even 6MOTY.

3. Our rebounding numbers will be in the top 5 or even top 3 in the league. Our starters alone are arguably one of the best rebounding lineups in the league. You have Lopez with 6.3rpg (but 3.3orpg), Taj 9.7rpg, Jimmy 6rpg, Wade with 4.7rpg and Rondo with 4.3rpg. The starters alone already combine 31rpg excluding the bench with Niko 7.3rpg and Felicio 5rpg, and so on.

4. Rondo will lead the league in Assist although this is not a quite bold one as he is the current assist leader and is even more capable of winning it again with the new offensive scheme of the Bulls where there is now much more less ISOs.

5. We will finish top 2 in the Eastern Conference behind the Cavs. The rest of the teams that I see making the Playoffs (in no particular order) are Boston, Indiana, Raptors, Pistons, Hawks, Heat.

6. Bobby Portis will go through a sophomore slump similar or even worse to what Niko went through. He will see less playing time whereas Felicio will get more minutes at the 5. Denzel Valentine will be wildly inconsistent throughout the season but will show flashes of how high his ceiling can be.

7. Canaan will not turn out to be Brooks 2.0.

8. We will be a top 10 defensive team. We won't be exposed to PnRs this year unlike last year with Pau and Derrick. Lopez is a very good upgrade overall in terms of defense and rebounds. Rondo is a bit of a wildcard but he can definitely step-up his defense so let's just pray that he will always keep this up and not go into selective matchups or any of that shit. Jimmy, Wade and Taj are already defensive studs. They'll be able to hold on their own.

"With our Bulls jumping out to a 3-0 start and leading the league in offensive efficiency despite being widely decried as a terrible offensive unit and a team without an identity, its easy to see why so many are hesitant to think that what the Bulls have been doing is in anyway sustainable. I'm here to talk a little bit about what I think that what we are seeing is very sustainable, and can work against the best teams in the league.

The Bulls have been winning games this year in impressive fashion. It has centered around four key areas rebounding, free throws, defensive intensity and fast breaks/offensive pace. Lets take a quick moment and dive into why these four things are so effective in combination as well as why I believe the Bulls have the pieces to keep this up.

Let's start with rebounds. There's actually already a good thread on this topic in this sub, so I won't go into too much more detail here and instead will just pass a link along https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/5ajqwc/a_brief_analysis_of_why_were_winning_and_why_we/ . The only thing I'd add is that we have a lot of other big bodies who are solid rebounders on top of just Gibson/Lopez and our backcourt. Niko, Portis, Felicio and Doug are all showing themselves to be very capable of boxing out and securing the board. Rebounding is so much more important than its given credit for because all teams are going to miss shots, even with terrible or great defense, but if you don't secure the rebound its meaningless.

Free throws- This was the factor I was most shocked everyone was missing about the Bulls this offseason. Butler and Wade are two truly elite players at getting to the line. Last season Butler ranked 8th and Wade 24th. Only two teams had players in comparable or better positions OKC (Westbrook 8, Durant 11) and LAC (Jordan 5, Blake 22). I'll get into why that OKC stat is special in a bit, and obviously the Clippers are there for a whole other issue due to hack a Jordan and neither player being efficient at the line. Niko has shown throughout his career to be very good at getting to the line and attempted the 108th most free throws in comparatively limited action. Rondo forces the action and he, Lopez and Gibson all were in the top 160 last season. 

Free throws are easily the most under appreciated part of the game in this analytics era. While its clear that 3s are more efficient than long twos, free throws are devastatingly efficient for far more reasons. One, you can in fact get three points in one possession, and you are getting points score in the high 70s low 80s with the players we're sending to the line. Beyond that, your team gets a free time out, the ability to have a reasonable chance to get an offensive rebound while having players back to prevent the fast break and allow your defense to set. You also can force important players of the opposing team off the court by getting them into foul trouble. There is absolutely no reason to believe this team will not continue to be elite at getting to the foul line. While certainly some nights the refs will swallow the whistle, free throws are something that become more frequent in close games and the playoffs. This is a major key to the Bulls potential success. So far this year the Bulls have been middle of the pack in total FTA, but they also have been blowing everyone out so its hard to get an accurate read there.

Defensive Intensity/Pace/Fast Break Points- This is where the Rondo acquisition gets lost on people. Rondo is extremely active at the point of attack, pressuring the ball at or above the half court line on most possessions, getting into people's chests and looking to get in the passing lanes. Yes, all of these things can be exploited to lead to some wide open layups, which is why Rondo is so fierce about needing to have communication from his bigs. Fortunately, these Bulls have the players to do this a la Rondo's time in Boston as opposed to his stint in Sacramento. Lopez, Gibson and now Felicio, Mirotic and Doug are all showing to be very capable at rotating and giving Rondo support. With MCW and Canaan the Bulls have a couple of backups who seem to show they have the same mentality. This has been directly leading to steals and blocks as teams get scattered when faced with this kind of attention.

Rondo backs this up by aggressively pushing the pace at any opportunity and getting easy baskets in transition. The Bulls have been killing teams on the fast break averaging 17 ppg which is all the more impressive considering they have been in two blowouts where they stopped pushing it in the same way in the second halves of two of the games. The three alphas have clearly made this a major sticking point of being on the floor for this team. http://uproxx.com/dimemag/chicago-bulls-fast-break-dwyane-wade-rajon-rondo-jimmy-butler/ Fortunately MCW and Canaan have also been strong at pushing the ball and getting players up the floor. Historically, Valentine has done the same thing. This is obviously the factor which would be easy to stop following through on, and will be the downfall of the Bulls if they do.

Now its easy to say that this kind of defense and ball movement is easy if you're playing good and mediocre teams but won't work against the best. But last years OKC Thunder have something to say about that. After getting absolutely blown out by the Spurs in game one, everyone (myself included) was convinced they were going to get laughed out of the series. They had no ball movement, and the Spurs were passing the ball in circles around them.

Then came the next 4 games where OKC completely flipped the tables, and absolutely got into San Antonio on defense. Using the same formula the Bulls have been showing off this season they laughed the Spurs out of the series with 4 straight wins, and followed it up by going up 3-1 on GS in the most impressive fashion possible. The games weren't even close, with GS clueless how to respond to so much passing and forceful defense.

The issue for OKC was they had about 6 years of bad habits to overcome. They spent the entire season with Brad Stevens slowly getting the pieces in the right places, and it clicked at the perfect time. Unfortunately, when push came to shove, Westbrook and Durant choked, started stopping the ball and Westbrook stopped setting the tone on defense. 

That OKC team is a very good case study for what this Bulls team is looking to do. It certainly had more talent at the top with Durant and Westbrook and had a solid starting big man rotation with Ibaka, Adams and Kanter. They were used their fantastic rebounding to win throughout the regular season and then pushed it to a whole new level with their ball movement and defensive intensity for a 10 game stretch. The issue for them beyond just getting away from their aggressive style of play was they had a real weakness on the wings. Against the warriors, their best bet was to put Ibaka or Adams at the 5 and have Durant be the 4 to prevent Green from causing ruckus by screening steph or klay's man as Durant can stick with either of those guys. Unfortunately, this exposed the fact that all they had was Lamb, Waiters, Morrow and Payne. All of these guys gave them the ability on the defensive end to play aggressive, but none of them were even mediocre three point shooters and only Waiters is halfway decent off the bounce. 

While that Thunder team certainly had more talent at the top with Westbrook and Durant, Butler and Wade are no slouches. The Bulls meanwhile, have a plethora of guys who can create offense off the bounce for themselves and their teammates with Rondo and Niko being elite, MCW being top tier and Valentine, Grant and even Zipser having shown that potential throughout their young careers. They also have surprising abundance of shooting specialists with Doug, Niko, Canaan and now Hunter and Zipser all fitting that bill.

What's truly incredibly is not only do the Bulls have all that wing depth, they also have a similar cavalcade of bigs as the OKC team did last season. Gibson, Lopez, Niko, Felicio and Portis is no joke of a 5 man rotation and none of those guys are in their 30s. The fact their are so many of them and they are so young should help them be able to keep up with the backcourt and keep pushing the pace while still sprinting back on defense.

The Bulls have an ideal lineup to play Hoiberg and Steven's dream system of pressure defense and great rebounding leading to fast breaks and baskets in transition. When you do get in the half court, you use extra passes and a four out, one in setup that is intended to set up a lot of dribble penetration and then kick outs for open threes. The Bulls actually have a vastly better lineup to play this style than OKC did last season, and so their is ample reason to be stoked for this team.

Its not going to be easy to keep playing this way game in and game out, but it also wasn't easy to start playing this way from game 1 with 9 new guys. There is every reason to believe that this is what Fred and Rondo got all excited about when they talked in the off season and why Wade decided to make the change and come to our team. This is what the 3 alphas want to see, and since they don't have any bad habits to revert to, I'm extremely hopeful we could see this team be a monster in the playoffs.

Cheers to everyone who stuck through this analysis. Appreciate any of your thoughts!","Why this Bulls team looks so legit and what can stop it With our Bulls jumping out to a 3-0 start and leading the league in offensive efficiency despite being widely decried as a terrible offensive unit and a team without an identity, its easy to see why so many are hesitant to think that what the Bulls have been doing is in anyway sustainable.

After getting absolutely blown out by the Spurs in game one, everyone (myself included) was convinced they were going to get laughed out of the series. They had no ball movement, and the Spurs were passing the ball in circles around them.

Then came the next 4 games where OKC completely flipped the tables, and absolutely got into San Antonio on defense. Using the same formula the Bulls have been showing off this season they laughed the Spurs out of the series with 4 straight wins, and followed it up by going up 3-1 on GS in the most impressive fashion possible. The games weren't even close, with GS clueless how to respond to so much passing and forceful defense.

The issue for OKC was they had about 6 years of bad habits to overcome. They spent the entire season with Brad Stevens slowly getting the pieces in the right places, and it clicked at the perfect time. Unfortunately, when push came to shove, Westbrook and Durant choked, started stopping the ball and Westbrook stopped setting the tone on defense. 

That OKC team is a very good case study for what this Bulls team is looking to do. It certainly had more talent at the top with Durant and Westbrook and had a solid starting big man rotation with Ibaka, Adams and Kanter. They were used their fantastic rebounding to win throughout the regular season and then pushed it to a whole new level with their ball movement and defensive intensity for a 10 game stretch. The issue for them beyond just getting away from their aggressive style of play was they had a real weakness on the wings. Against the warriors, their best bet was to put Ibaka or Adams at the 5 and have Durant be the 4 to prevent Green from causing ruckus by screening steph or klay's man as Durant can stick with either of those guys. Unfortunately, this exposed the fact that all they had was Lamb, Waiters, Morrow and Payne. All of these guys gave them the ability on the defensive end to play aggressive, but none of them were even mediocre three point shooters and only Waiters is halfway decent off the bounce. 

While that Thunder team certainly had more talent at the top with Westbrook and Durant, Butler and Wade are no slouches. The Bulls meanwhile, have a plethora of guys who can create offense off the bounce for themselves and their teammates with Rondo and Niko being elite, MCW being top tier and Valentine, Grant and even Zipser having shown that potential throughout their young careers. They also have surprising abundance of shooting specialists with Doug, Niko, Canaan and now Hunter and Zipser all fitting that bill.

What's truly incredibly is not only do the Bulls have all that wing depth, they also have a similar cavalcade of bigs as the OKC team did last season. Gibson, Lopez, Niko, Felicio and Portis is no joke of a 5 man rotation and none of those guys are in their 30s. The fact their are so many of them and they are so young should help them be able to keep up with the backcourt and keep pushing the pace while still sprinting back on defense.

The Bulls have an ideal lineup to play Hoiberg and Steven's dream system of pressure defense and great rebounding leading to fast breaks and baskets in transition. When you do get in the half court, you use extra passes and a four out, one in setup that is intended to set up a lot of dribble penetration and then kick outs for open threes. The Bulls actually have a vastly better lineup to play this style than OKC did last season, and so their is ample reason to be stoked for this team.

Its not going to be easy to keep playing this way game in and game out, but it also wasn't easy to start playing this way from game 1 with 9 new guys. There is every reason to believe that this is what Fred and Rondo got all excited about when they talked in the off season and why Wade decided to make the change and come to our team. This is what the 3 alphas want to see, and since they don't have any bad habits to revert to, I'm extremely hopeful we could see this team be a monster in the playoffs.

"Here's the #1 reason: Rebounding.

If you've watched the Bulls games, they've actually won it a few different ways, but that has been consistent.

Game 1: Bulls shot only 39%, compared to 50% from the Celtics.
They won the rebounding battle a whopping 55 to 36, and 18 offensive rebounds to 3.

They didn't shoot well. But they got a hell of a lot more shots than Boston.

Game 2: A blowout against the Pacers. This time the Bulls shot 52%, and won the rebound battle 47 to 34, and maintained a 5 ORB advantage. Better rebounding + good shooting = Blowout.

This game was more normal for shooting. No 3s from Wade, Butler, and Rondo. Lots from Doug and Canaan.

Game 3 was a repeat of Game 2, albeit against a worse team, so a bigger blowout. 58 to 45 on rebounds, 50% shooting to 34.4%.

1-3 from 3 for Wade, 2-3 from Jimmy, but Niko and Canaan put up 7 3pt makes between the 2 of them.

The Bulls are winning because Taj Gibson is averaging 14 RB/36 and RoLo is averaging 5 ORB/36. 

While we also have great rebounders in Rondo, Wade and Butler.

This means the Bulls will get more shots than almost any other team, thus counteracting the slight lack of 3P shooting on the starting 5.

We're #1 in 2nd chance points, and #3 in 2nd chance points allowed. The margin is about 10 ppg between what we get and what we allow, which is a massive number and gives us a head start in every game.

Also, Warriors, Cleveland, Raptors, Spurs. Which one of them has rebounders that can compete? We will still win the rebounding matchups against the best NBA teams. It remains to be seen if that will be enough to counteract their advantages.","A brief analysis of why we're winning, and why we can keep it up. Here's the #1 reason: Rebounding.

"Hey all!

I'm lucky enough to have had the opportunity to begin writing with Hashtag Basketball about the Chicago Bulls and other NBA teams. The team is in a really weird spot this year where I'm not quite too sure what to make of them, but I'm willing to admit that I misjudged our three point shooting abilities. For one game, anyway.

I wrote this article [here](http://www.hashtagbasketball.com/chicago-bulls/content/chicago-bulls-three-point-shooting) regarding our shooting against the Boston Celtics, that has a few gifs of Jimmy/Wade making threes, but ultimately I am wondering if this level of three point shooting is sustainable enough. I doubt we're a 44% three point shooting throughout the year or anything close...but I do wonder if suddenly Wade and Butler can be effective enough from deep.

Do you guys think this was a bit of a fluke game, or are Butler and Wade going to be threats from three point range? Jimmy was knocking down threes in the face of solid defenders (Jae Crowder, Al Horford), so who knows.","[OC/Article I wrote] We need to talk about the Bulls shooting from deep vs Boston Hey all!

Felicio played 7:44 minutes at center in the first half and scored four points.  He had no rebounds, no assists, no steals, no blocks, and two personal fouls.  In the second half Hoiberg went with Lopez and Gibson at center, with Mirotic playing more minutes at power forward, rather than playing Felicio.  Felicio had a plus minus of -7.

Doug McDermott played 21:52 minutes.  We keep making excuses for him, but his defense is still poor, and he can't seem to get his shot off as much as we would all like.  Yes, they don't run a lot of plays for him, but it would be nice if they didn't have to.  When he did shoot he was 2 of 5, 0 of 1 from three, and 1 of 2 from the free throw line, for a total of 5 points.  He had one rebound, one assist, one turnover, and one personal foul.  McDermott had a plus/minus of -5.

Isiah Canaan was another one of our three point shooters who couldn't hit threes last night (while our non-shooters couldn't miss).  Like Felicio, Canaan played only in the first half.  He was 0 for 3 for no points, with 2 rebounds, 1 assist, and 1 steal.  IIRC, he missed wide open catch-and-shoot corner threes, which should be easy shots for a three point specialist.  In the second half, Hoiberg let Michael Carter-Williams run point instead, and he had more success.  Canaan had a plus/minus of -2.

It's just one game, of course, I know that.  I just want to keep an eye on the players who don't perform, and see if they turn it around.  I would expect the three point shooters from last year (including Mirotic, who was otherwise terrific) to start hitting -- and the non-three point shooters to start missing.

Edit:  Can anyone tell me how to make the entire table appear in this post?  If not, I recapped the stats and you can always check out the original table at the link.

In the second half Hoiberg went with Lopez and Gibson at center, with Mirotic playing more minutes at power forward, rather than playing Felicio.  Felicio had a plus minus of -7.

Doug McDermott played 21:52 minutes.  We keep making excuses for him, but his defense is still poor, and he can't seem to get his shot off as much as we would all like.  Yes, they don't run a lot of plays for him, but it would be nice if they didn't have to.  When he did shoot he was 2 of 5, 0 of 1 from three, and 1 of 2 from the free throw line, for a total of 5 points.  He had one rebound, one assist, one turnover, and one personal foul.  McDermott had a plus/minus of -5.

Isiah Canaan was another one of our three point shooters who couldn't hit threes last night (while our non-shooters couldn't miss).  Like Felicio, Canaan played only in the first half.  He was 0 for 3 for no points, with 2 rebounds, 1 assist, and 1 steal.  IIRC, he missed wide open catch-and-shoot corner threes, which should be easy shots for a three point specialist.  In the second half, Hoiberg let Michael Carter-Williams run point instead, and he had more success.  Canaan had a plus/minus of -2.

It's just one game, of course, I know that.  I just want to keep an eye on the players who don't perform, and see if they turn it around.  I would expect the three point shooters from last year (including Mirotic, who was otherwise terrific) to start hitting -- and the non-three point shooters to start missing.

Edit:  Can anyone tell me how to make the entire table appear in this post?  If not, I recapped the stats and you can always check out the original table at the link.

Edit:  [The Athletic chimes in with a D- for McDermott, a C+ for Felicio, and a C- for Canaan.](https://theathletic.com/23810/2016/10/28/player-report-cards-bulls-105-celtics-99/)",11,4,"Notably bad performances for the Bulls: Isaiah Canaan, Doug McDermott, Cristiano Felicio",https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/59v1d7/notably_bad_performances_for_the_bulls_isaiah/

"Okay so I'm in class right now and shit is dragging, so I decided to just make this breakdown of what I think we need to see out of each player if we can expect to make a playoff run this season.

Jimmy Butler:

* Better inside shooting. Based on what I saw in preseason he really needs to step up and make more shots inside. 

*   Defense. This is a must. With our starting line-up, we will need Jimmy to step up and help out Rondo who showed some struggle getting through screens. 

* Aggressiveness. Jimmy's best games last year were the ones where he attacked the basket, whether on a drive, or off a cut. He simply cannot afford to sleep on offense. 

Wade:

* Steals. Wade has the quickness and insight to poke the ball away, and he does it on ball. We need these types of steals, since Rondo is known to bite, and take risks to intercept passes. I'd rather Wade play up on his man, and get a steal that won't give up a free lane.

* Three point. We need Wade in this regard. Based on preseason, he is the best three point shooter in our starting lineup. Not to say that he shouldn't take midrange shots (his bread and butter), but we have to make threes in today's league. He is our best option.

* Composure. I saw a lot of games last year where we were down by a few points and basically shat the game away (and some where we were up too). Wade can be the veteran presence to keep our guys chill. Remember, short memory.

Rondo:

* Good passes. Notice I said ""good passes"" and not assists. Rondo is a fantastic PG and he has vision and skill in the passing game that Rose couldn't provide. However, leave the stat padding back in Sacramento. 

* Drives. Rondo passes a lot. So, guys play off him. That gives him plenty of chances for a free lane to the basket, and he needs to take these. I noticed that the games we won in preseason were the ones where Rondo had a lot of points.

* Defense. Rondo plays off his matchup...by a mile. This is how he plays, and it won't change. However, he can be what he excels at, which is pass interceptions. He just needs to choose his opportunities, and not risk giving his man a free drive.

Lopez:

* I love this guy. Such an improvement at the position and a vital defender that we needed. Lopez needs to continue to clog the lane and get blocks.

* Boards. He is tall as shit. Rebounds on the offensive and defensive end are important for a team like ours that may require second chances with our three's.

* Shooting. Lopez is a much much better shooter than Noah (I love Noah so don't hate me, just beeing real). He needs to help out with midrange shots and put-backs. 

Taj:

* Defense. I agree with Hoiberg's decision to start Taj. Much more consistent than Niko, and obviously a much better defender. Niko basically high fives his matchup on their way to a free drive. Taj can clog the lane and challenge the drive.

* Shooting. Don't. He needs to drive to the basket, and shoot only when absolutely open. He isn't the worst shooter, but rythym is a huge factor in games. We need Wade, Rondo, and Butler to get into their rythym.

* Consistency. As I mentioned above, Taj is more consistent than Niko, mostly because he isn't a shooter, as much as he is a defender. He cannot afford to lose tempo and jog back and forth. 

Hope I sparked some intrigue with these points. All this shit is pretty obvious, but thought I'd get it down on paper (or, er...electronic paper).","What we need to see out of our players this season.

"With the advancement in technology now, almost everything related to the game can be measured.

&nbsp;

Advanced team and individual stats are a commodity. It's impact to the game is so strong, that the game is rapidly evolving. But up to now they can just get data from events that are tangible. I haven't encountered a system who can measure individual or team BBIQ and it's impact on the game.

&nbsp;

Back in the 80's, it's the ""thinkers"" who made the game evolve. Bird, Magic and Jordan are high BBIQ guys. Successful players have that degree of basketball IQ. It enables them to maximize, not only their own potential, but also the potential of people around them.

Dennis ""the worm"" Rodman is portrayed differently because of his antics. But this guy [won multiple championships because of his basketball IQ](http://www.businessinsider.com/dennis-rodman-basketball-genius-2014-3).

&nbsp;

Fred Hoiberg get rid of the players who see doesn't fit his style of basketball. Everyone knows him about what he preach. ""Pace and space"" and well... Shooting... 


But did anyone recognize the players he added to the team? 

&nbsp;

Contrary to what most believe, Hoiball is not about shooting Becasue MCW wouldn't be here if that's the case. Hoiball is about giving players the freedom to decide on their own. I'm not comparing him to the ""Zen Master"" but it's more that way. Letting them play it out and mature. Let the players play ""the way they know to,"" without a drill sergeant yelling plays at the side line.

&nbsp;

So don't look at this team half empty...

&nbsp;

*Rondo can't shoot! Then we brought a back-up point guard who also can't shoot! So we need to settle with a streaky shooter in Canaan...*

&nbsp;

BS! 

&nbsp;

Did anyone bother to sum up Rondo, MCW and [Canaan](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1691134-isaiah-canaan-primer-everything-you-need-to-know-about-newest-houston-rocket) BBIQ?

&nbsp;

Add Zel, Grant and even the newly acquired RJ Hunter... All of our back court additions this season are high BBIQ guys.

&nbsp;

By now the trades of ""D.Rose for RoLo and Grant"" and ""Snell for MCW"" made perfect sense. 



","Forget about shooting, let's talk BBIQ With the advancement in technology now, almost everything related to the game can be measured.

Advanced team and individual stats are a commodity. It's impact to the game is so strong, that the game is rapidly evolving. But up to now they can just get data from events that are tangible. I haven't encountered a system who can measure individual or team BBIQ and it's impact on the game.

&nbsp;

Back in the 80's, it's the ""thinkers"" who made the game evolve. Bird, Magic and Jordan are high BBIQ guys. Successful players have that degree of basketball IQ. It enables them to maximize, not only their own potential, but also the potential of people around them.

Dennis ""the worm"" Rodman is portrayed differently because of his antics. But this guy [won multiple championships because of his basketball IQ](http://www.businessinsider.com/dennis-rodman-basketball-genius-2014-3).

&nbsp;

Fred Hoiberg get rid of the players who see doesn't fit his style of basketball. Everyone knows him about what he preach. ""Pace and space"" and well... Shooting... 


But did anyone recognize the players he added to the team? 

&nbsp;

Contrary to what most believe, Hoiball is not about shooting Becasue MCW wouldn't be here if that's the case. Hoiball is about giving players the freedom to decide on their own. I'm not comparing him to the ""Zen Master"" but it's more that way. Letting them play it out and mature. Let the players play ""the way they know to,"" without a drill sergeant yelling plays at the side line.

&nbsp;

So don't look at this team half empty...

&nbsp;

*Rondo can't shoot! Then we brought a back-up point guard who also can't shoot! So we need to settle with a streaky shooter in Canaan...*

&nbsp;

BS! 

&nbsp;

Did anyone bother to sum up Rondo, MCW and [Canaan](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1691134-isaiah-canaan-primer-everything-you-need-to-know-about-newest-houston-rocket) BBIQ?

&nbsp;

Add Zel, Grant and even the newly acquired RJ Hunter... All of our back court additions this season are high BBIQ guys.

&nbsp;

By now the trades of ""D.Rose for RoLo and Grant"" and ""Snell for MCW"" made perfect sense.

"First and foremost, since they play a different position they should be evaluated differently. With this trade on the table we had two options:

1. Keep Snell and run a 2nd group with either Canaan/Grant/Dinwiddie at backup PG, then running McDermott/Snell at the wing, and probably Niko/Felicio in the post.

2. MCW runs point, Mcdermott can be paired with Valentine or Zipser or another PG, then Niko/Felicio.

I like 2 because it improves defense in the 2nd group and gives us as close as a true point guard as you can get for a bench group, and also allows guys like Zipser and Valentine to develop and contribute, and really doesn't give up much shooting, either.

Snell has always seemed to have good shooting ability but was only 32% from 3 last year, and is under 40% fg shooter in his career. So it's not like we are giving up a young Klay Thompson. He's just not a plus scorer in any way. Valentine and Zipser could both easily replace 35% from 3 in limited minutes, and have more upside than Snell outside just shooting. We probably don't lose much wing defense with them either (but we do get a big bump for defense at the PG spot.)

I get that Snell seems to stretch the floor, but execution matters. Snell has been lacking in that department. I hear the ""fit"" argument a little too much. It's just more complicated than ""MCW can't shoot.""

I know that MCW isn't without flaws, but do we really want a wing who has had 3 chances at a breakout season, and was really only looking at ~10 minutes per game this year? Or do we want to solidify the 2nd group with a true point guard who is a huge plus defensively, and who can be surrounded by shooting in a 2nd group with McDermott and Niko? I'll take the latter.

Edit: FWIW I think Snell has upside, he seems like a great dude and a hard worker, and I hope he does well in Milwaukee.","My unpopular opinion: MCW is a better ""fit"" for this team than Tony Snell was First and foremost, since they play a different position they should be evaluated differently.

"What the title says. The Bulls have traditionally been a team that has built through the draft, but we usually have to add pieces through free agency or trades. We typically know who to draft, but I feel like it's up to the players to put in more hard work by themselves other than being taught right. If I had to grade the Bulls, I would give them the following.

* Drafting: B+, Lamarcus Aldridge, Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose, Taj Gibson, Jimmy Butler, Jusuf Nurkic, Bobby Portis, Denzel Valentine, Drafted Marquis Teague over Draymond Green even though Thibs wanted Green

* Decision Making: B-, Traded LA for Tyrus Thomas, Traded for the rights to Luol Deng, Traded Jusuf Nurkic for Doug McDermott

* Development: C+, Rose and Butler managed to become All-Stars, but I feel that was based majorly off of their own efforts. We have yet to see improvements from McDermott or Mirotic and we have dropped/traded players due to them not performing.

* Overall: B, Above average overall, but we don't come close to the Thunder or Warriors.

"I'm brainstorming something because the Lakers have a weird roster construct at the 2 and 4 spots, so I'm curious how Bulls fans would respond to this:

If the Lakers called and asked about McBuckets, what would you want from LAL in return? Is there anything we have that is an actual, desirable, EQUAL return? It's possible that's a ""no"" but I'm just curious. You guys are pretty low on 3pt shooting so I imagine he's probably pretty valuable to you guys.

"**Starters: Rondo, Wade, Butler, Mirotic and Lopez**

&nbsp;

Niko start to get his timing back.


It is expected he will disappear in some games. But as long as he stop doing those pump fakes, he will spread the floor for the rest of the starters.


The advantage of having Rondo and Wade(compared to having D.Rose and MDJ last year) is that, these guys now how to get themselves and their teammates going. Niko would be playing with good defenders too(compare to having Rose, MDJ and Pau), so his flaws could be hidden.


As for the rest of the starters, we kinda know what to expect from them on a nightly basis.

&nbsp;

**Bench: Carter-Williams, Valentine, McDermott, Gibson and Felicio**


Note: Assuming MCW-Snell trade is a done deal.


I really love this trade as MCW would put up consistent numbers against other teams bench. His a mediocre to below average NBA starter. But at 6'6 playing with shooters(in Zel, Doug and Felicio), Taj and him would tear up the other team bench in PnR.

&nbsp;

**Reserves: Grant, Canaan, Dinwiddie, Zipser and Portis**

&nbsp;

I see Dinwiddie and Canaan competing for minutes with Zel and MCW. There would be times that those two would have a bad game. Dinwiddie and Canaan is very capable of providing that spark, I just don't see them putting consistent numbers in a nightly basis. 

Zipser is really a rookie. He has potential but needs more experience.

And there is no way Bobby Portis is taking away Felicio's minutes. His just too inconsistent.

"Dinwiddie has easily been the biggest surprise at point guard, as someone who sat 4th on the the PG depth chart going into the season has now presumably locked up the 2nd spot with his preseason show. What can we expect from him going forward?
 
If you've read any articles about Dinwiddie, you probably have heard about his ACL tear during his junior year at Colorado. Spence was supposed to be an easy first-round pick, but PGs with torn ACLs are usually not the most desirable commodity. However, Spencer was a legitimately rounded player during his time with the Buffs. He can shoot from range (good mechanics too), pass effectively, get by his defenders with a good first step, and use a variety of moves and shots from midrange to chip in wherever possible. He might not be the guy who will yam it on three defenders, but he's an extremely intelligent person and knows how to play within himself. 

Dinwiddie's measurables are also perfect for a modern point guard. He stands at 6'6 in shoes with a 6'8.25"" wingspan, though he's still not the biggest guard (only about 200 lb right now). Some other tall guards that you might want to compare to Spencer: 

* Shaun Livingston: Shaun is one of the best-case scenarios for Spencer's development, with a smooth pull-up jumper and excellent court vision. Livingston, even after his triad of knee injuries, is a little more dunk-inclined but a little slower. In addition, his post game is extremely refined and he uses his height and length (6'7, 6'11 wingspan) to abuse smaller guards on the block. Prior to his knee tragedy, Livingston was potentially the future of the league. He was stunningly quick, explosive to the rim, and a player who could assert himself on the court while still involving teammates. Dinwiddie is not that, but he is a more reliable outside shooter than Livingston. Shaun's vision and post game are two things that Spence could really benefit from improving. Obviously being shorter and having a less impressive wingspan hinder Dinwiddie's ceiling in the post, but it's still a facet worth working on.

* Michael Carter-Williams: MCW is a lower bar for Dinwiddie than Livingston. He's an average athlete, a poor shooter, and a high-usage, low-reward player who hasn't done much since winning Rookie of the Year in 2014. He'll probably be used in a reserve role in Milwaukee. Dinwiddie's shooting ability and lesser bell dependence make him a more useful player on most contending teams, and he can be plugged into various lineups for multiple functions. So what makes Michael better? Uh, not much. The average Joe puts him over Spencer because of what he did in Philadelphia, but even in a starting role for Milwaukee (not a great team, but certainly better than 2014 Philly) his numbers were pretty poor. His career FG% is 41.2, which is basement-tier for a guy that averages just 13.3 shot attempts over that same span. Last year, he set a personal best 3PT%. It was 27%. You understand the issue. Carter-Williams is near-useless as a scorer, and a career AST/TO ratio of 1.79 would suggest he isn't an effective distributor either. 

* Oscar Robertson: LOL. The Big O was perhaps the first -- and 2nd-most successful -- of the tall guard generation. A gifted athlete, a talented shooter and post player. I don't think Spencer will be averaging a triple-double any time soon, but it never hurts to hope.

* Magic: Arguably a small forward. He played point but the dude was fuckin' gigantic. Couldn't really shoot, but played post better than half of the bigs of his time. Brilliant court vision. Ran one of the greatest offenses in league history. Don't expect this from Spence either.

* Ron Harper: This may be one of the best comparisons for Spencer. Harper didn't do a ton of ball-handling in Chicago, but the 6'6 combo guard played stout defense and spot-up shooting during his tenure in a Bulls uniform. Dinwiddie is a better ball-handler than Harper, but taking on even a fraction of Harper's defensive capability would make him extremely valuable.

So there you go. Big guards can go in a couple of directions as they progress. I'm happy for the progress Spencer has made so far, and I hope we continue to see some growth as he adjusts to the playing time and roster around him!","Looking at Spencer Dinwiddie Dinwiddie has easily been the biggest surprise at point guard, as someone who sat 4th on the the PG depth chart going into the season has now presumably locked up the 2nd spot with his preseason show.

"With the preseason underway, here are some of my current thoughts on how our team is looking like. Please note, I haven't found the time to watch full games, but I have been tuning in here and there. If I say something incorrect, please let me know!

**1. Odd man out at PG.**

Rondo is still the indisputable starter. But both Canaan and Dinwiddle have played very well relative to preseason standards. Both should have a decent shot at making the 15-man roster. But one name is uncertain: Jerian Grant. He looks to be 4th in the PG rotation this season, except that Butler, Wade, and even Valentine have ball-handling capabilities. Don't get me wrong, this is a great luxury to have, but Grant is on a guaranteed contract. What do the Bulls end up doing with him? 

**2. What's up with Felicio?**

Towards the end of last season, Felicio showed a lot of flashes. But he's largely been absent during the preseason, which has been concerning. ~~What's more, I haven't seen much improvement from him.~~ We should not expect much from ~~a second-round pick~~ an undrafted player, but while his energy remains high, he continues to get caught out of position on defense. He remains an important part of this team, because our center depth is sorely lacking. But he will need to make large strides this year.~~, else our bench lineup will have a huge hole in the middle.~~ 

**3. Taj or Niko?**

Probably the toughest decision for Hoiberg. We knew this would be a logjam coming into the season, but after the first few games, this topic has become interesting. Besides the last game, Niko has played terrible overall. Moreover, his bad habits from last season have carried into this season. On the flipside, Taj has played solid, like he always has been for us. My opinion says to start Taj, but strategically, this is a bad look for the starting lineup, with the lack of spacing. One can only hope that Niko builds upon the last game against Indiana and can cement his starting role on this team. 

**4. Wade can shoot? + Thoughts on our stars.**

Wade has been shooting above average this preseason. This is encouraging, but I would take this with a grain of salt. Fresh legs are important for shooting, so it will be interesting to see how Wade shoots as the season wears on. On the flip side, our three stars seem to have gotten off to a great start. Rondo's command of the offense is superb. I hate to say it, but I think Derrick's lack of point guard intuition hurt Hoiberg's ability to run an offense greatly. Rondo seems like he understands Hoiberg's ideas at a very deep level. Jimmy on the other hand has been playing decent, moving the rock and taking (mostly) good shots. For this team to succeed, these three must be willing to share the spotlight and move the ball to the shooters.

"I recently bought a Michael Jordan jersey and wanted to know more about it. The jersey is made by Champion and is fully stitched, name and numbers. On the bottom front of the jersey there are three patches, one with the Chicago Bulls logo, one saying ""Designed and Tailored Exclusively for Chicago Bulls"" and it also has the numbers 94 and 95 on the patch (referring to the season), and the last patch has the Champion logo and says 56 (referring to the size).

One major question I had is I know this season (94-95) Jordan returned to play and wore #45, but my jersey is a #23, so why is that?

Also, it seems to be the quality jersey the players would wear, with the sewn names and numbers and everything, and the patch on the front saying ""Exclusively for Chicago Bulls"", so could it have been worn by Jordan? Or was it just a top-end jersey sold during that time?

He also said Zipser will get some PT tomorrow and Niko will get the start at PF.

"Taj pulled the start at PF in Chicago's first preseason game vs Milwaukee.  Many assumed this summer that Mirotic would automatically inherit that spot, if only to have *some* level of shooting *somewhere* in the starting unit.

Obviously, I'd expect to see more experimenting in the rest of the preseason matchups but is the starting 4 spot Taj's to lose?  Whatever deficiencies Nikola Mirotic has in terms of consistency as a starter seem to be outweighed by other factors.  For one, how abysmal a Portis/Niko frontcourt pairing would be defensively.  Even against reserve units.  Two, defenses not having to honor any Bulls starter past 16-18 feet as a shooter if Taj starts.

Something about Gibson starting last night made me think Hoiberg might actually keep that lineup for the regular season.  Who would most like to see start?  What would Taj/Niko have to show you in preseason to gain/lose that spot?","Taj Gibson as a starter Taj pulled the start at PF in Chicago's first preseason game vs Milwaukee.

3. Money. If I went to the game with $300 in my wallet would that be sufficient for parking, possibly two Uber, dinner (car will already be gassed up from different set of money)

4. Leave time. We live in Kankakee County, Google maps says it's a 1 hour drive. Given the holiday what time would you recommend leaving?

"Of course, those five include four starters and a starter/sixth man: 	Dwyane Wade (34), Taj Gibson (31), Rajon Rondo (30), Robin Lopez (28), and Jimmy Butler (27).

But the Bulls are rebuilding on the fly, and don't have long term commitments to Wade, Rondo, or Gibson.  The future rests in the hands of the younger (25 and under) players on the team, and the Bulls have spread their net wide, hoping that a few of them can turn into solid players, and one or two of them into stars.  I would like to make the playoffs simply to give those players post-season experience.  But most of all, I just want to see those players play well.

Here's the list: Isaiah Canaan (25), Nikola Mirotic (25), J.J.

I'm not going to try to predict who, if anyone, will have a break out year.  It's possible none of them will, which would be a pity.  Some are bigger gambles than others -- especially the second-round draft picks and undrafted players, and especially those on training camp contracts.

"Well it was all a good day at bulls media day though until Nick Friedell had to show up and ruin what was a quiet but positive media day. I don't know what it is with Nick Friedell but it just seem he's such anti-bulls all the time.

"Hey everyone,

I'm looking to attend the Knicks vs. Bulls game on November 4th. I see that the individual tickets are available on September 23rd but I'm wondering if anyone has advice on whether it's better to purchase Bulls tickets when they're first released through NBA.com, or if it's financially advantageous to buy the tickets on Stubhub (once the tickets have been already released for a few days).

In other words, for a decent regular season game, is it typically cheaper to buy cheap seats on Stubhub or buy cheap seats through NBA.com (face-value)?

Thank you!

"So I went and looked through the pass tracking data for the past two seasons and found some interesting stuff about how your offense flowed and how it contributed to Rose's assist %. You can read all of the stuff I found on the Knicks sub,[ at this link here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/52o570/oc_brief_analysis_of_the_bulls_offense_in_201415/), but I can't go back as far as I'd like in the tracking data. 

I can look as far back as 2013-14 but Rose only played 10 games so it doesn't really seem worth the effort. What I really want to know about is what the offense was like in 2010-11 and 2011-12. Obviously Rose was healthy and playing at a higher level, but there are some questions that I can't answer based on the present information I have.

But basically the TL;DR of my post is that Rose passed to Gasol and Butler 54% of the time (nearly 2000 passes), only having them shoot on 24% of those passes making a basket 45% of the time. Two seasons ago, Rose passed roughly the same amount of times (2079) and players shot at a lower rate (23.1%) but made their shots at a higher rate (48.8%). In 2010-11 and 2011-12 Rose had the highest AST% of his career of 38.7 and 40.3%. This past year he was at 25.5% (lowest of career) and the year prior, at 30.7% (close to rookie and sophomore seasons).

What, in your Bulls fan professional opinion, resulted in this massive drop in Assist %? Was it the addition of Gasol and/or the emergence of Jimmy Butler? Was it actually Rose suffering from injury and not actually being an effective point guard? 

Did Rose cause the offense to struggle (while he was playing) or did the offense cause Rose to struggle?

Edit: Thank you guys. You were a huge help. From how you all talk it wasn't necessarily Rose being inefficient but the offense being stagnant and the players he passed to wanting to create on their own. This is excitedly, right in line with what I was thinking.","Hoping you guys can help me get a better understanding of what happened to Roses AST% from 2010-11 vs 2014-15 and 2015-16.

I still have some big additions left (like a playoff schedule/bracket) but I'll keep those for a later date since that's further away.

After I'm done with this, I'll attack r/BullsTix again to fix that and maybe try to get a few more people to help me moderate that (I've had some PMs about to to make sure people don't get scammed so I'll double check to make sure we don't fuck that up).

Anyways, one of the big thing I've also got contacted about was the possibility of a Discord server for the sub. Well, us moderators have been using one for quite a while now but it wasn't created by me and I don't have currently admin permissions on it so I've decided to create a new one and set it up myself and open it up to the community so that we can have some cool stuff happening there and let people chat up in real time with one another.

It's not ready just yet but once it is, I'll make another thread about it.

That's my update for now, see you guys for the preseason real soon!

Jerry Reinsdorf is about to enter the basketball Hall of Fame.  Although he inherited Michael Jordan, he deserves some credit for hiring Jerry Krause and Phil Jackson and presiding over the Bulls dynasty.  Perhaps he was too loyal to Krause, though, who alienated everyone on the team.  Or perhaps he was too loyal to the team, because he refused to permit Krause to trade Pippen and rebuild in 1997, dooming the team to tanking after Jordan's retirement.

He's been remarkably generous to many former Bulls players, including some who did not even play for the team when Reinsdorf owned it.  Several of them have jobs with the team today.  One of those former players is John Paxson, Vice President of Basketball Operations.

My biggest compliment to Jerry Reinsdorf is that he is not James Dolan, owner of the Knicks, who is willing to spend money but has no idea how to do it wisely.  My biggest complaint is that he is not Jerry Buss, former owner of the Lakers, who was willing to spend money and knew how to do it wisely.  Instead, Jerry Reinsdorf is a smart businessman who has maximized profits from a big market team, but since 1998 has not maximized wins or championships.  

Does he deserve to be in the basketball Hall of Fame?  If you are going to elect owners to the basketball Hall of Fame, then sure, he's a longtime owner who has had a big impact on the game.  But I understand why many Bulls fans don't love him.  Despite his generosity to former players, there's just this sense that while presiding over one of the three most profitable team in the league, he cares more about profits than he does about championships.  While that is his right, it doesn't endear him to fans.","Point and counterpoint from Blog A Bull regarding Jerry Reinsdorf, and my own thoughts.

1) Bulls offseason moves convicted me that our FO have absolutely no plan about franchise's future. Our motto for this year is ""see what happens"", but thats not a plan. 

2) Maybe Rajon Rondo isn't a 'great' 3pt shooter, but he is not as bad as people say. [Last season](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/rondora01.html) Rondo has 170 3PA and .365 3P%. I'm expecting the best season of Rajon Rondo's career.

4) But we wont miss Joakim Noah.

Is there a better place to sit? We are currently looking at 303 or 314 but couldn't tell from the website if there are home and away ends?

"[Here's the link for those with ESPN Insider privileges.](http://insider.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/17375776/projected-records-win-totals-standings-every-nba-team-2016-17-season)

And here's the story, courtesy of /u/DishingLikeClyde from /r/nba.  (Warning, it's bad news for the Bulls.  But at least they finish ahead of the Knicks.)

>How many games will the Golden State Warriors win after adding Kevin Durant to the core of a team that went 73-9 last season? Which teams might jump from the lottery to the playoffs, and who might they replace?

>To help answer these questions, here's an early look at 2016-17 NBA projections using ESPN's real plus-minus (RPM).

>RPM was developed by Jeremias Engelmann and Steve Ilardi to estimate a player's on-court impact on team performance, measured in net point differential per 100 offensive and defensive possessions. RPM takes into account teammates, opponents and additional factors. When used along with playing time projections, it's proved to be a very accurate predictive tool overall.

>Last season, these projections correctly forecast that the Portland Trail Blazers would be more competitive than expected, the Boston Celtics would maintain their second-half success from the year before and the Milwaukee Bucks would fall out of the playoffs. (They also missed on other teams, including the Toronto Raptors emerging as a top threat to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference and the Houston Rockets limping along near .500.) Two years ago, RPM foresaw the rise of the Golden State Warriors.

>Like last season, I've put together projected playing time based on a formula that estimates games missed based on the number missed over the past three seasons (adjusted for any offseason injuries/suspensions) and my own guesses at how rotations will shake out.

>Most veteran players are rated using the multiyear, predictive version of RPM, adjusted for the typical aging curve. Newcomers to the league and players who played too little for an RPM rating are rated using their projected offensive and defensive rating from my SCHOENE projection system, which incorporates translated performance in the NCAA and professional leagues besides the NBA.

>Let's take a look at the results.

>**Western Conference**

>1.Golden State Warriors Projected wins: 66.8

>Within the context of the conservative nature of win projections, which tend to be regressed heavily to the mean, a 67-win projection is remarkable. The Warriors' projection is two wins higher than the next best in the seven years I've gone back to do projections using this method: 64.9 for the 2010-11 Miami Heat, who actually won just 58 games because of the time it took their version of the Big Three to build chemistry on the court.

>2.San Antonio Spurs Projected wins: 54.5

>It's a huge step downward to second place in the West. With Tim Duncan's retirement and the aging of other core players, the Spurs will be hard-pressed to stay with Golden State in the regular season as they did last season. But RPM still has them comfortably second in the West.

>3.Utah Jazz Projected wins: 47.6

>This might seem like a crazy leap for a team that didn't make the playoffs last year, but remember: The Jazz actually had the fifth-best point differential in the West (plus-1.8 PPG). Ordinarily, that would translate into 46 wins, and that was despite injuries (including Dante Exum missing the entire season) and before Utah loaded up with veterans this offseason. The Jazz should be considered the favorites to win the Northwest Division.

>4.L.A. Clippers Projected wins: 46.3

>Given the Clippers won 53 games last year without Blake Griffin for much of the season, a seven-win drop would be a surprise. But RPM sees several key players on the wrong side of the aging curve.

>5.Houston Rockets Projected wins: 45.8

>RPM projects the Rockets to be a top-five offense next year, but they'll still struggle to reach 45 wins if their defense is worse than an optimistic projection of 16th in the league.

>6.Oklahoma City Thunder Projected wins: 45.6

>Even without Durant, RPM forecasts the Thunder in the mix for home-court advantage in the West thanks to star point guard Russell Westbrook and a deep cast of young role players.

>7.Portland Trail Blazers Projected wins: 44.5

>After reaching the second round of the playoffs and adding Festus Ezeli and Evan Turner this offseason, the Blazers hope to take the next step in their development. RPM sees them as about the same team as 2015-16, when they won 44 games but finished fifth in a weaker West.

>8.Denver Nuggets Projected wins: 40.4

>Quietly, the Nuggets have assembled an intriguing group of young talent (led by RPM favorite Nikola Jokic, projected for plus-5.0 points per 100 possessions) with a few veterans in tow. Even with Danilo Gallinari projected for just 50 games, internal development could be enough to push Denver into surprising playoff contention.

>9.Memphis Grizzlies Projected wins: 39.4

>Yes, the Grizzlies strengthened their starting lineup by signing Chandler Parsons, but their bench is incredibly thin and several starters (including Parsons) are major injury risks. Gulp.

>10.Sacramento Kings Projected wins: 37.7

>The Kings have one of the biggest discrepancies of any team between their projection in ESPN's summer forecast (30 wins, 13th in the West) and by RPM, which sees Sacramento deep in average talent around DeMarcus Cousins.

>11.Minnesota Timberwolves Projected wins: 37.1

>Remember, RPM projections don't factor in coaching, and the arrival of Tom Thibodeau makes the Timberwolves overwhelmingly likely to outperform their projected ranking of 27th in defensive rating.

>12.New Orleans Pelicans Projected wins: 37.0

>New Orleans is deeper after shopping for midtier free agents this summer, but RPM projects just three players on the roster to be better than league average: Anthony Davis, Jrue Holiday and newcomer Solomon Hill.

>13.Dallas Mavericks Projected wins: 34.3

>Might this be the year that coach Rick Carlisle, veteran big man Dirk Nowitzki and a cast of newcomers can't get the Mavericks to the playoffs? RPM says yes, since swapping Parsons (plus-1.3) for Harrison Barnes (minus-0.7) grades as a major downgrade.

>14.Phoenix Suns Projected wins: 29.2

>The Suns figure to be a bit more competitive with the return of RPM favorite Eric Bledsoe (plus-2.2) but are still too young to compete in the West.

>15.L.A. Lakers Projected wins: 24.3

>Despite their offseason additions of No. 2 pick Brandon Ingram and veterans Luol Deng and Timofey Mozgov, RPM has the Lakers with the league's fewest projected wins.

>**Eastern Conference**

>1.Cleveland Cavaliers Projected wins: 52.1

>While the Cavaliers are still solidly tops in the East, their projection is down from last year's 57 wins because RPM takes a dim view of Kyrie Irving's defense and considers Matthew Dellavedova (plus-1.2 projection) a considerable loss as Irving's backup. Note that this projection assumes J.R. Smith ultimately re-signs in Cleveland.

>2.Boston Celtics Projected wins: 49.8

>Last year, RPM nailed the Celtics' 48-win finish, though the Raptors jumped ahead of Boston to take second in the East. Now, RPM sees the Celtics taking a modest step forward with the addition of Al Horford.

>3.Toronto Raptors Projected wins: 48.8

>After getting career years from guards DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry, the Raptors are likely to regress to the pack this year, but fans can take solace in Toronto having outperformed its RPM projection each of the past three seasons.

>4.Detroit Pistons Projected wins: 47.5

>While most of the East's middle class took a step backward this offseason, the Pistons should improve by virtue of upgrading at backup point guard and center, and RPM sees them as the third team in a tier with Boston and Toronto.

>5.Washington Wizards Projected wins: 41.4

>There's a big gap between the top four in the East and a pack of teams projected fifth through about 11th. The Wizards lead that group after going 18-13 after last year's All-Star break.

>6.Charlotte Hornets Projected wins: 41.0

>Though the return of Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (plus-2.0) should be a boost, RPM doesn't like the Hornets' new backup backcourt of Ramon Sessions (minus-2.4) and Marco Belinelli (minus-3.7).

>7.Milwaukee Bucks Projected wins: 40.9

>The Bucks have oscillated between wildly under- and overperforming projections. If that trend holds, this should be the year for exceeding expectations, and RPM views both Dellavedova and Mirza Teletovic (minus-0.6) as upgrades.

>8.Indiana Pacers Projected wins: 38.9

>By virtue of having one of the East's top players in Paul George and a promising youngster in Myles Turner, the Pacers are getting contender buzz in the East. RPM is not so optimistic, viewing the swap of George Hill (plus-0.8) for Jeff Teague (minus-0.6) as a downgrade.

>9.Atlanta Hawks Projected wins: 38.6

>RPM has had a tough time forecasting the Hawks, pegging Atlanta for near-.500 records each of the past two seasons, when the Hawks have actually finished second and fourth in the East. This time, Atlanta may have to beat its projection to make the playoffs.

>10.Miami Heat Projected wins: 38.3

>Even with Chris Bosh in the lineup, the Heat may have a tough time making the playoffs after losing Luol Deng, Joe Johnson and Dwyane Wade. Without Bosh, Miami's projection drops to 35.2 wins and 12th in the East.

>**11.Chicago Bulls Projected wins: 37.8**

And here's the story, courtesy of /u/DishingLikeClyde from /r/nba.  (Warning, it's bad news for the Bulls.  But at least they finish ahead of the Knicks.)

>How many games will the Golden State Warriors win after adding Kevin Durant to the core of a team that went 73-9 last season? Which teams might jump from the lottery to the playoffs, and who might they replace?

>To help answer these questions, here's an early look at 2016-17 NBA projections using ESPN's real plus-minus (RPM).

>RPM was developed by Jeremias Engelmann and Steve Ilardi to estimate a player's on-court impact on team performance, measured in net point differential per 100 offensive and defensive possessions. RPM takes into account teammates, opponents and additional factors. When used along with playing time projections, it's proved to be a very accurate predictive tool overall.

>Last season, these projections correctly forecast that the Portland Trail Blazers would be more competitive than expected, the Boston Celtics would maintain their second-half success from the year before and the Milwaukee Bucks would fall out of the playoffs. (They also missed on other teams, including the Toronto Raptors emerging as a top threat to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference and the Houston Rockets limping along near .500.) Two years ago, RPM foresaw the rise of the Golden State Warriors.

>Like last season, I've put together projected playing time based on a formula that estimates games missed based on the number missed over the past three seasons (adjusted for any offseason injuries/suspensions) and my own guesses at how rotations will shake out.

>Most veteran players are rated using the multiyear, predictive version of RPM, adjusted for the typical aging curve. Newcomers to the league and players who played too little for an RPM rating are rated using their projected offensive and defensive rating from my SCHOENE projection system, which incorporates translated performance in the NCAA and professional leagues besides the NBA.

>Let's take a look at the results.

>**Western Conference**

>1.Golden State Warriors Projected wins: 66.8

>Within the context of the conservative nature of win projections, which tend to be regressed heavily to the mean, a 67-win projection is remarkable. The Warriors' projection is two wins higher than the next best in the seven years I've gone back to do projections using this method: 64.9 for the 2010-11 Miami Heat, who actually won just 58 games because of the time it took their version of the Big Three to build chemistry on the court.

>2.San Antonio Spurs Projected wins: 54.5

>It's a huge step downward to second place in the West. With Tim Duncan's retirement and the aging of other core players, the Spurs will be hard-pressed to stay with Golden State in the regular season as they did last season. But RPM still has them comfortably second in the West.

>3.Utah Jazz Projected wins: 47.6

>This might seem like a crazy leap for a team that didn't make the playoffs last year, but remember: The Jazz actually had the fifth-best point differential in the West (plus-1.8 PPG). Ordinarily, that would translate into 46 wins, and that was despite injuries (including Dante Exum missing the entire season) and before Utah loaded up with veterans this offseason. The Jazz should be considered the favorites to win the Northwest Division.

>4.L.A. Clippers Projected wins: 46.3

>Given the Clippers won 53 games last year without Blake Griffin for much of the season, a seven-win drop would be a surprise. But RPM sees several key players on the wrong side of the aging curve.

>5.Houston Rockets Projected wins: 45.8

>RPM projects the Rockets to be a top-five offense next year, but they'll still struggle to reach 45 wins if their defense is worse than an optimistic projection of 16th in the league.

>6.Oklahoma City Thunder Projected wins: 45.6

>Even without Durant, RPM forecasts the Thunder in the mix for home-court advantage in the West thanks to star point guard Russell Westbrook and a deep cast of young role players.

>7.Portland Trail Blazers Projected wins: 44.5

>After reaching the second round of the playoffs and adding Festus Ezeli and Evan Turner this offseason, the Blazers hope to take the next step in their development. RPM sees them as about the same team as 2015-16, when they won 44 games but finished fifth in a weaker West.

>8.Denver Nuggets Projected wins: 40.4

>Quietly, the Nuggets have assembled an intriguing group of young talent (led by RPM favorite Nikola Jokic, projected for plus-5.0 points per 100 possessions) with a few veterans in tow. Even with Danilo Gallinari projected for just 50 games, internal development could be enough to push Denver into surprising playoff contention.

>9.Memphis Grizzlies Projected wins: 39.4

>Yes, the Grizzlies strengthened their starting lineup by signing Chandler Parsons, but their bench is incredibly thin and several starters (including Parsons) are major injury risks. Gulp.

>10.Sacramento Kings Projected wins: 37.7

>The Kings have one of the biggest discrepancies of any team between their projection in ESPN's summer forecast (30 wins, 13th in the West) and by RPM, which sees Sacramento deep in average talent around DeMarcus Cousins.

"Hi everyone! Last year I made a post on lineup projections that went over pretty well, so I’m back at it again this year!

Last year our roster was all about continuity. This year, it’s all about shaking it up. At a glance, our roster seems a little flawed. But we have some promising young pieces and we still have our superstar guard in Jimmy Butler. Let’s jump into it then.

**Point Guard**

Starter: Rajon Rondo

Bench: Jerian Grant, Spencer Dinwiddle, Isaiah Canaan

Our PG spot took a bit hit this offseason. We effectively traded Derrick Rose for Rajon Rondo. Both aren’t known as marksmen. Rose is the more dynamic player; he looked to score and attack. Rondo is the opposite, preferring to facilitate. There are valid criticisms over whether Rondo’s assists are actually “selfish”, and I’m interested in seeing the discussion about it over the course of next season. It remains to be seen whether Rondo is a better fit for Hoiberg’s system. Nevertheless, Rondo’s high BBIQ will definitely help running Hoiberg’s offense, and despite the narrative, Rondo hit an above average percentage on threes last season. In addition, Rondo has always been solid on defense, albeit preferring to gamble for steals (lucky Thibs isn’t here, or he’d have heart problems by the end of the season). 

Our depth at the point is shallow. Last year, we had a dependable Hinrich for half a season, a dynamite in Aaron Brooks, and an emergence in Moore, who was very solid. All of them are now gone, for better or worse. This year, the second-string looks to be in flux. We have the second-year Jerian Grant, obtained from the Rose trade to NY. For what it’s worth, he looked pretty good during Summer League, winning the LV Summer League MVP. It remains to be seen whether the young Grant can carve out a career in the NBA. He gets a chance to prove it this year. Other than Grant, Dinwiddie and Canaan are both candidates as well. Dinwiddie is interesting, as he’s 6’6”, and has played relatively well with the limited minutes he got in Detroit (he dropped 9 assists on us last season). Canaan got a lot of minutes in Philly last season, which isn’t saying much, but he shot the three well, and that’s something we desperately need this season. Hopefully, one of these three will develop into a solid backup this season. 

**Shooting Guard**

Starter: Dwyane Wade

Bench: (Jimmy Butler), Denzel Valentine, Jerian Grant, Isaiah Canaan, Paul Zipser, Tony Snell

Last year, Butler started at the two, with a variety of combo guards and Snell backing him up. Like I’ve said above, most of these guards are gone and replaced with new additions. Denzel Valentine is our shiny new rookie, but Dwyane Wade will start. Wade is getting up there in age, and won’t provide the outside shooting we need, but he’s the type of veteran we need to stabilize the locker room. Even with his decline, Wade is still capable of taking over a game and scoring at will, as he showed in the playoffs. He’ll be a great mentor to Valentine and the other young guys on the team. Tangibly, Wade provides us with some of the attacking that Rose took with him to New York. While Wade’s defense has slipped off in recent years, we should count on him to provide an average presence on that end of the floor as veterans often understand defensive principles much better than youngsters. Expect to see some smart cheating on the defensive side from Wade, but be prepared for some lapses throughout the season. In addition, if need be, we have Butler for heavy defensive assignments, so Wade can hide a little when paired with Butler. 

Valentine will probably back up Wade, as Wade probably won’t able to play too many minutes. That gives Valentine a lot of room to grow. Valentine is an exciting addition, because he really has that range to open up Hoiberg’s offense, and the length to grow into a nice defender. Of course, don’t expect that kind of defense coming into the league. Even known defenders like Winslow need time adjusting to the grown-man size and strength of the NBA. Another downside is that he’s already 22. Other options include downsizing and sliding Grant or Canaan over to the two. Someone correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t see Dinwiddie listed as a SG, so I’ve left him off this list. If we want to upsize, we have another rookie in Paul Zipser who’s coming over from Germany. I personally haven’t seen him play, so I can’t say how he will fit on this team. Oh, and there’s Tony Snell. I’ve given up on him. 

Another option when Wade is out of the game is to play Butler at the two. That’s why I’ve put him there in parentheses. 

**Small Forward**

Starter: Jimmy Butler

Bench: Doug McDermott, Paul Zipser, Tony Snell

With Rose gone, this is Butler’s team to carry now. With Dunleavy gone and Wade here, Butler’s been pushed back to the 3, where he will probably stay for most of the season. Butler had a slightly down year last year, but overall he’s still one of the top shooting guards in this league. Butler excels at cutting and slashing, albeit he didn’t do much of that last year. He is also a good-to-great isolation player, ranking well last year in isolation percentages. Last year, he faced some criticisms over the lack of ball movement and a tendency to isolate. He dropped off a little in defense, although I’m a firm believe that advanced defensive metrics never tell the whole story. Butler by all means is still a lockdown defender; it will be up to him to decide whether or not he wants to exert that much energy on the defensive side of the ball. With Rondo on the team though, look for Butler to go back to his slashing abilities that he built his name on, as well as his famed defensive tenacity that we all fell in love with during the Thibs years. 

The backup spot likely goes to McDermott and Zipser, with Snell here for emergencies (god forbid we have to dig that deep). Dougie showed a lot of promise last year, although his defense is still suspect. Hopefully, we see some tangible improvements on that end. Of course, as long as he can shoot the three, he will find a lot of time in Hoiberg’s system. Zipser is also something that can play some minutes here. Oh, and Snell. Overall, we’ll be pretty deep when it comes to the wings. 

**Power Forward**

Starter: Nikola Mirotic

Bench: Taj Gibson, Bobby Portis

Taj is a Bulls lifer, and one of the most dependable players we’ve had throughout recent years. Sadly, it may come to an end this season. With our front office going younger and some interesting young power forwards on our team, it may be finally time to say goodbye to Taj. Typically, Taj would start, but with the lack of shooting in our projected starting lineup, we desperately need a stretch-four here. So Mirotic gets the spot. Threekola is currently playing for Spain in Rio right now, and we’ll definitely need his sharpshooting when he gets back. Mirotic didn’t have a great year last year due to his appendicitis, but even after his return, he shot blistering hot from deep. Of course, we have all come to groan at his pump fakes, flops, and less-than-average defense, but as he matures into an NBA player, hopefully some of those bad habits will begin to fade. 

On the bench, we’ll have Gibson playing significant minutes including some at center. Nothing major to note here, as we all know about Taj’s hustle, scrap, defensive presence, and his tendency to always god damn put the ball on the ground after an offensive rebound instead of going up strong and fast (UGH). He’s a known commodity and veteran that we’ll appreciate in our locker room. Let’s talk about Portis. He had a promising rookie year, but he’s definitely still a raw prospect. His jumper looks good, and he has a motor reminiscent of Noah, but he’ll definitely need to work on picking the right spots, efficiency, footwork, and passing, to name a few things. Hopefully he takes a step forward and replaces Gibson in terms of production. I see Portis needing a year or two more before he fills into a dependable role player though. 

**Center**

Starter: Robin Lopez

Bench: Cristiano Felício

Pau is gone, and Noah is gone. For us, the center position has undergone the biggest change since last season. Lopez is our shiny new toy from NY, and he’s a proven NBA-caliber center. I’m not the biggest fan of Pau; I thought that while he produced for us, his deficiencies in his defense unraveled much of our interior defense. Lopez will provide the defensive presence that we sorely missed last season, while still providing us with the great free throw shooting that we depended on from Pau last season. He won’t have Pau’s range, but he can still knock down the free-throw line jumper. In addition, Lopez shoots well from the corner mid range, another plus. Another plus on Lopez is that he has the intangibles. He screens well and rolls well, and can finish near the rim unlike Noah last season. (I’ll admit I haven’t followed Lopez’s career as much, but from the scouting reports I read online, those things popped up to me)

As for backups, Felício is our only other true center on the roster. He showed some flashes last season, and hopefully he develops into a good backup. Like I said above though, should Hoiberg choose to downsize GSW-style, Gibson will find some time at the five. Look for Felício to provide some important minutes, holding down the fort while the starters rest. 

**Potential Trade Moves**

Locked in: Rajon Rondo, Dwyane Wade, Jimmy Butler

Want to Develop (Youngsters): Bobby Portis, Denzel Valentine, Paul Zipser, Doug McDermott, Nikola Mirotic, Jerian Grant

Plays a Shallow Position: Robin Lopez, Cristiano Felício

Will Move at the Right Price: Taj Gibson

Dump Him at all Costs: Tony Snell

Roster Bubbles: Spencer Dinwiddle, Isaiah Canaan

**Lineups**

I threw together some potential lineups. Didn't put too much thought into them, so critique and destroy below as you wish.

**Starting**: Rondo, Wade, Butler, Mirotic, Lopez

Our starting lineup lacks the spacing, but we don’t have many options. Dougie could start over Butler for outside shooting but that’s a quick way to get fired. Similarly, Valentine isn’t ready for the starting spot, nor is Grant. Canaan isn’t a starting caliber point guard either. 

**Lineup**: Rondo, Valentine, Butler, Mirotic, Gibson

A “small ball” lineup, featuring Gibson at the center. It’s not really small of course, as Valentine and Butler provide a lot of length on the wings. Of course, OKC provided a beautiful proof of concept on how to counter small-ball. Nevertheless, few teams have the size and the skill set that Adams/Kanter provided. This lineup also gives Valentine the chance to play with 3 veterans on the court, while giving Wade a necessary breather. 

**Lineup**: Grant/Canaan, Butler, McDermott, Gibson, Lopez

This lineup is saucy. Butler becomes the de facto point guard, while the point and McDermott serve as sharpshooters. Gibson and Lopez are in to inhale any rebounds. Expect to see this lineup run. 

**Lineup**: Grant/Canaan, Butler, McDermott, Mirotic, Lopez

Fuck defense, want extra hot sauce. 

**Lineup**: Butler, Wade, McDermott, Mirotic, Gibson

Squeezing out Rondo and allowing Butler to take full point duties. Another small ball lineup that you should expect to see run a lot. 

**Bench-Heavy Lineup**: Grant/Canaan, Butler, Zipser, Portis, Felicio

It’s common practice in the NBA to have a starter surrounded by 4 bench players. You can swap out Butler for Wade here too. 

**Garbage Time**:

Grant/Canaan, Valentine, Zipser, Portis, Felicio

**Outlook**

This season will be significantly different from last, from the standpoint of expectations. Last season we came in with the idea of pushing deep into the playoffs. That didn’t work out. We’ve retooled for some short-term stopgaps, but our talent level on paper has dropped a little. We have, however, amassed a multitude of young promising talents. This year, I’m going to be watching this team with the intention of following our young players’ growths, instead of getting frustrated for wins. I see this roster having a baseline of 30-35 wins, but if Hoiberg has some magic in his fingers, I would not be surprised to see 40-45 with a playoff spot come April. 

Alright, if you guys have any suggestions or if I forgot something, let me know! Also my computer likes correcting Hoiberg to Holberg, so let me know if you see that…

He gets a chance to prove it this year. Other than Grant, Dinwiddie and Canaan are both candidates as well. Dinwiddie is interesting, as he’s 6’6”, and has played relatively well with the limited minutes he got in Detroit (he dropped 9 assists on us last season). Canaan got a lot of minutes in Philly last season, which isn’t saying much, but he shot the three well, and that’s something we desperately need this season. Hopefully, one of these three will develop into a solid backup this season. 

**Shooting Guard**

Starter: Dwyane Wade

Bench: (Jimmy Butler), Denzel Valentine, Jerian Grant, Isaiah Canaan, Paul Zipser, Tony Snell

Last year, Butler started at the two, with a variety of combo guards and Snell backing him up. Like I’ve said above, most of these guards are gone and replaced with new additions. Denzel Valentine is our shiny new rookie, but Dwyane Wade will start. Wade is getting up there in age, and won’t provide the outside shooting we need, but he’s the type of veteran we need to stabilize the locker room. Even with his decline, Wade is still capable of taking over a game and scoring at will, as he showed in the playoffs. He’ll be a great mentor to Valentine and the other young guys on the team. Tangibly, Wade provides us with some of the attacking that Rose took with him to New York. While Wade’s defense has slipped off in recent years, we should count on him to provide an average presence on that end of the floor as veterans often understand defensive principles much better than youngsters. Expect to see some smart cheating on the defensive side from Wade, but be prepared for some lapses throughout the season. In addition, if need be, we have Butler for heavy defensive assignments, so Wade can hide a little when paired with Butler. 

Valentine will probably back up Wade, as Wade probably won’t able to play too many minutes. That gives Valentine a lot of room to grow. Valentine is an exciting addition, because he really has that range to open up Hoiberg’s offense, and the length to grow into a nice defender. Of course, don’t expect that kind of defense coming into the league. Even known defenders like Winslow need time adjusting to the grown-man size and strength of the NBA. Another downside is that he’s already 22. Other options include downsizing and sliding Grant or Canaan over to the two. Someone correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t see Dinwiddie listed as a SG, so I’ve left him off this list. If we want to upsize, we have another rookie in Paul Zipser who’s coming over from Germany. I personally haven’t seen him play, so I can’t say how he will fit on this team. Oh, and there’s Tony Snell. I’ve given up on him. 

Another option when Wade is out of the game is to play Butler at the two. That’s why I’ve put him there in parentheses. 

**Small Forward**

Starter: Jimmy Butler

Bench: Doug McDermott, Paul Zipser, Tony Snell

With Rose gone, this is Butler’s team to carry now. With Dunleavy gone and Wade here, Butler’s been pushed back to the 3, where he will probably stay for most of the season. Butler had a slightly down year last year, but overall he’s still one of the top shooting guards in this league. Butler excels at cutting and slashing, albeit he didn’t do much of that last year. He is also a good-to-great isolation player, ranking well last year in isolation percentages. Last year, he faced some criticisms over the lack of ball movement and a tendency to isolate. He dropped off a little in defense, although I’m a firm believe that advanced defensive metrics never tell the whole story. Butler by all means is still a lockdown defender; it will be up to him to decide whether or not he wants to exert that much energy on the defensive side of the ball. With Rondo on the team though, look for Butler to go back to his slashing abilities that he built his name on, as well as his famed defensive tenacity that we all fell in love with during the Thibs years. 

The backup spot likely goes to McDermott and Zipser, with Snell here for emergencies (god forbid we have to dig that deep). Dougie showed a lot of promise last year, although his defense is still suspect. Hopefully, we see some tangible improvements on that end. Of course, as long as he can shoot the three, he will find a lot of time in Hoiberg’s system. Zipser is also something that can play some minutes here. Oh, and Snell. Overall, we’ll be pretty deep when it comes to the wings. 

**Power Forward**

Starter: Nikola Mirotic

Bench: Taj Gibson, Bobby Portis

Taj is a Bulls lifer, and one of the most dependable players we’ve had throughout recent years. Sadly, it may come to an end this season. With our front office going younger and some interesting young power forwards on our team, it may be finally time to say goodbye to Taj. Typically, Taj would start, but with the lack of shooting in our projected starting lineup, we desperately need a stretch-four here. So Mirotic gets the spot. Threekola is currently playing for Spain in Rio right now, and we’ll definitely need his sharpshooting when he gets back. Mirotic didn’t have a great year last year due to his appendicitis, but even after his return, he shot blistering hot from deep. Of course, we have all come to groan at his pump fakes, flops, and less-than-average defense, but as he matures into an NBA player, hopefully some of those bad habits will begin to fade. 

On the bench, we’ll have Gibson playing significant minutes including some at center. Nothing major to note here, as we all know about Taj’s hustle, scrap, defensive presence, and his tendency to always god damn put the ball on the ground after an offensive rebound instead of going up strong and fast (UGH). He’s a known commodity and veteran that we’ll appreciate in our locker room. Let’s talk about Portis. He had a promising rookie year, but he’s definitely still a raw prospect. His jumper looks good, and he has a motor reminiscent of Noah, but he’ll definitely need to work on picking the right spots, efficiency, footwork, and passing, to name a few things. Hopefully he takes a step forward and replaces Gibson in terms of production. I see Portis needing a year or two more before he fills into a dependable role player though. 

**Center**

Starter: Robin Lopez

Bench: Cristiano Felício

Pau is gone, and Noah is gone. For us, the center position has undergone the biggest change since last season. Lopez is our shiny new toy from NY, and he’s a proven NBA-caliber center. I’m not the biggest fan of Pau; I thought that while he produced for us, his deficiencies in his defense unraveled much of our interior defense. Lopez will provide the defensive presence that we sorely missed last season, while still providing us with the great free throw shooting that we depended on from Pau last season. He won’t have Pau’s range, but he can still knock down the free-throw line jumper. In addition, Lopez shoots well from the corner mid range, another plus. Another plus on Lopez is that he has the intangibles. He screens well and rolls well, and can finish near the rim unlike Noah last season. (I’ll admit I haven’t followed Lopez’s career as much, but from the scouting reports I read online, those things popped up to me)

As for backups, Felício is our only other true center on the roster. He showed some flashes last season, and hopefully he develops into a good backup. Like I said above though, should Hoiberg choose to downsize GSW-style, Gibson will find some time at the five. Look for Felício to provide some important minutes, holding down the fort while the starters rest. 

**Potential Trade Moves**

Locked in: Rajon Rondo, Dwyane Wade, Jimmy Butler

Want to Develop (Youngsters): Bobby Portis, Denzel Valentine, Paul Zipser, Doug McDermott, Nikola Mirotic, Jerian Grant

Plays a Shallow Position: Robin Lopez, Cristiano Felício

Will Move at the Right Price: Taj Gibson

Dump Him at all Costs: Tony Snell

Roster Bubbles: Spencer Dinwiddle, Isaiah Canaan

**Lineups**

I threw together some potential lineups. Didn't put too much thought into them, so critique and destroy below as you wish.

**Starting**: Rondo, Wade, Butler, Mirotic, Lopez

Our starting lineup lacks the spacing, but we don’t have many options. Dougie could start over Butler for outside shooting but that’s a quick way to get fired. Similarly, Valentine isn’t ready for the starting spot, nor is Grant. Canaan isn’t a starting caliber point guard either. 

**Lineup**: Rondo, Valentine, Butler, Mirotic, Gibson

A “small ball” lineup, featuring Gibson at the center. It’s not really small of course, as Valentine and Butler provide a lot of length on the wings. Of course, OKC provided a beautiful proof of concept on how to counter small-ball. Nevertheless, few teams have the size and the skill set that Adams/Kanter provided. This lineup also gives Valentine the chance to play with 3 veterans on the court, while giving Wade a necessary breather. 

**Lineup**: Grant/Canaan, Butler, McDermott, Gibson, Lopez

This lineup is saucy. Butler becomes the de facto point guard, while the point and McDermott serve as sharpshooters. Gibson and Lopez are in to inhale any rebounds. Expect to see this lineup run. 

**Lineup**: Grant/Canaan, Butler, McDermott, Mirotic, Lopez

Fuck defense, want extra hot sauce. 

**Lineup**: Butler, Wade, McDermott, Mirotic, Gibson

Squeezing out Rondo and allowing Butler to take full point duties. Another small ball lineup that you should expect to see run a lot. 

**Bench-Heavy Lineup**: Grant/Canaan, Butler, Zipser, Portis, Felicio

It’s common practice in the NBA to have a starter surrounded by 4 bench players. You can swap out Butler for Wade here too. 

**Garbage Time**:

Grant/Canaan, Valentine, Zipser, Portis, Felicio

**Outlook**

This season will be significantly different from last, from the standpoint of expectations. Last season we came in with the idea of pushing deep into the playoffs. That didn’t work out. We’ve retooled for some short-term stopgaps, but our talent level on paper has dropped a little. We have, however, amassed a multitude of young promising talents. This year, I’m going to be watching this team with the intention of following our young players’ growths, instead of getting frustrated for wins. I see this roster having a baseline of 30-35 wins, but if Hoiberg has some magic in his fingers, I would not be surprised to see 40-45 with a playoff spot come April. 

Alright, if you guys have any suggestions or if I forgot something, let me know! Also my computer likes correcting Hoiberg to Holberg, so let me know if you see that…

Jimmy Butler has not been ball dominant in the Olympics, and he's fine with that, when he gets 15 minutes he still scores, rebounds, and plays defense without the ball in his hands much at all.  I'm quite sure his usage percentage will go down in 2016-17, as well, and he'll be fine with that.",61,39,Jimmy Butler is not ball dominant.,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/4y60ro/jimmy_butler_is_not_ball_dominant/

"With LeBron signing a 3 year contract with a player option for the 3rd year this can mean a few things for our beloved Bulls. This is all speculative and just a guy trying to put 2 and 2 together. I think I've figured out our future and when Gar says he is retooling he really means that Dwyane Wade is his secret tool towards winning our 7th championship.

1.) Dwyane Wade's contract is for 2 years with a player option for the 2nd year. He will accept his second year and hit free agency in 2018-19. 

2.) LeBron will decline the player option on his 3 year 100 million dollar contract after two years as well. He will will then become a free agent with Wade in 2018-2019.

3.) Chris Paul has a player option for 2017-2018 which he will likely accept. He will also then become a free agent in 2018-2019.

4.) Carmelo Anthony has a early termination player option for 2018-2019 which he will likely decline. He will also become a free agent in 2018-2019.

5.) Going into 2018-2019 free agency, we will only have Jimmy Butler under contract and Robin Lopez under contract (also Valentine Portis and Grant under rookie contracts). These 5 players will take up a total of 43 million cap room. Doug McDermott will be a restricted free agent.

6.) Salary cap is expected to reach over 130 Million by the 2018-19 season. This means we will have about 87 million in cap.

7.) Wade recruits his boys to Chicago. LeBron gets 20 million per year for 2 years / Paul gets 20 million per year for 2 years / Melo gets 20 million per year for 2 years / Wade gets 20 million per year for 2 years. 

8.) With 7 million in cap space we sign our rookies from 2019 NBA draft and sign some ring chasers. 

9.) Depending on how Dougie develops the next two years we resign him by going over the cap. (If he sucks then we just let him go in free agency).

10.) **New lineup:** Paul / Butler / LeBron / Melo / Lopez ~ 6th man: Wade  **Bench mob:** Grant / Valentine / Ring Chaser (or McDermott or rookie) / Portis / Ring Chaser (or rookie)

We will have a core of Butler, Wade, LeBron, Melo and Paul for 2 years in which we will win 2 championships. Once their contracts are up, Wade will be 38, Paul will be 35, Anthony will be 36, LeBron will be 35 and Jimmy will be 30. We then resign Jimmy and build another dynasty for him around Westbrook (or Curry), Anthony Davis and Durant with Rose as 6th man.

##Edit: I've gotten a ton of interesting responses from this post and the general theme is that I am crazy and this is nonsense and will never happen. Yes, this is crazy, yes this will probably never happen. But this idea is not impossible. Please guys, even if our future does not involve the bananaboatbros, please stay optimistic.

"There's a lot of anger towards GarPax about this offseason, and I personally feel that some of it is justified.  This thread is a place to share things you think the Bulls could have reasonably done instead.

Personally, I don't completely hate the Rondo contract because we can get out of it after this year, I do dislike the Wade contract because we can't.  I don't like the Rose trade because I don't think RoLo or Jerian Grant are likely to be positive assets, but I understand that we had to sell low.  I do think Lopez's contract is at least trade-able, but I don't have any faith that our FO will make an appropriate deal when the time comes.

I probably wouldn't have done the Rose trade, but the one thing I most definitely would have done is signed Bismack Biyombo.  I think Orlando quietly got the best value of the offseason in a player who just outplayed max-contract Hassan Whiteside in a playoff series but will make less money than Timofey Mozgov next season.  By my reckoning, this is the second year in a row that the Bulls have passed on an underrated free agent at a position of need that they could have likely locked up cheaply if they had shown any interest (Jeremy Lin 2015).  

Since we rarely get big name free agents, to me it seems incredibly important to be scouting hard for these good value role players free agents and locking them up when able.  I think GarPax have generally done a terrible job of this, and as best as I can tell from their record  our current scouting program involves checking basketball reference from 5 years ago.  Rip Hamilton 2011? C'mon son.

At this point, I guess we can hope that Rondo will play defense, Wade has something left in the tank, and Felicio's rise continues to NBA starter level, but I don't have high hopes.  Personally I will be working on developing a time machine so that I can return to the past and find a way to blackmail Reinsdof into firing GarPax and promoting Thibs to POBO.

"First thought that comes to mind is Niko he should be the obvious choice right? Well for me I'm not ready to just hand Niko the starting job come October given his inconsistencies last 2 years. Niko was both wildly inconsistent shooting and scoring and u just didn't know what you would get from him on a daily basis. I know Niko changed his shot with his release and etc but he still needs TO PROVE he can shoot consistently at the NBA LEVEL. You need somebody to space the floor Niko does do that

I would make Doug available for the 4 he has gotten stronger and leaner where he can play the 4 position. Scoring wise Doug wasn't consistent mostly cause of the lack of shots. Though shooting he was consistent and offensively he can do more on offense cause he is a good athlete (run/jump). McDermott getting stronger can help him develop his post move even more. He can cut, fade, drive to the rim at times, has developed a very nice floater, etc. Compared to Niko, Mcdermott is a much more rounded offensive weapon for the bulls. On defense McDermott has worked hard to get better and also wants to improve his rebounding which are the main two things he needs to improve on.

What I would do if I'm Hoiberg see who performs better when preseason starts whoever does better during those games gets the starting gig. I'm not going to hand Niko the starting job he has to earn it. So who would u put at the 4: Mirotic, Mcdermott, or Portis?","Who should start at the 4 come October?

"After listening to the Dunc'd on Podcast I've to say I only partially agree with is the Rondo signing. I would've rather seen them try to trade a guy like Patrick Beverly or maybe another 3 and D point guard out there. (ET isn't the answer at PG guys) Rondo can dish the heck out the ball and I think there is potential for Rondo to work in this offense because of his creativity. Not saying that Rondo is gonna work out but I'm somewhat skeptical of his fit. The thing that keeps he hopeful about Rondo is that he doesn't have many chances left and he'll be out the league if this situation doesn't work out and I think he knows that so he has to be a team player this year with the Bulls. (Grade C-)

The next point I will move onto is the D-Rose trade. I think they Bulls played this well and got an underrated starting center and a decent PG prospect. I vehemently disagree with their take on RoLo. They basically said that RoLo was a below average starting center that can't play defense, which is furthest from the truth. That statement really shows their ignorance on RoLo as a player. At Rolo's last two stops NY and Portland, he helped move their defensive efficiency by 10 spots making them go from awful to respectable and he even helped Portland get to the top 10 defensively in his 2nd second season there. Also, RoLo helps out tremendously in the Rebounding department. When RoLo is on the floor the Knicks rebounding percentage goes up to 52% (which would have been good for top 4 in Rebounding percentage). With Jimmy, Rondo, Wade, Gibson, Portis etc. We should be a top 8 rebounding team. They also said that RoLo really won't help with their problems which is far from the truth. He helps with Rim Protection, Defense and Rebounding. (Grade A-)

Another point I would like to make is the D-Wade signing. I don't really have a problem with what they said about the Wade signing, but I think the locker room impact can possibly help change the culture of the team, much like Chauncey Billups going to the Nuggets. I would like it more if the PG was George Hill or Patrick Beverly (Grade C+/B-)

This next point discusses trading Calderon. Calderon doesn't have much left like Mike Dunleavy so to trade him in order to get D-Wade makes much sense. Also the Bulls do not really pick well in the second round, their last impact player they drafted in the second round was Asik. So, they won't miss those second round picks that much. (Grade B+/A-)

Letting go of Pau. He had to go. (Grade A)

The last point I want to bring up is the draft. Drafting Denzel in my opinion is a decent move, I would like it more if we didn't have McD already. If anything I would have liked them to trade down with Philly or Bos and pick Luwawu with one pick and acquired Patrick Beverly with another. (Grade B-/B)

In conclusion I do not think that the Bulls had a terrible offseason, could it be better? Obviously but It's not as bad as they make it out to be.

The user /u/anunmetplayer  found that using the formula: 

Black Hole % = (FGA per game * (1-AstFG%)) / Passes Received Per Game

You would find the players who stunt the offense.

Which one of these is not like the other...

Here's to hoping he can snap out of whatever it is that is causing this. 

Edit: the TLDR of the comments: 

Stats can be good, but many stats are used much out of place and incorrectly. 

I personally don't think that's the case here. 

This imo, is an accurate way of seeing the ""black holes"" in the offense. When it's Kobe/Okafor/Wade, it's not a problem.

"I think people are really undervaluing Jimmy's 3 point shooting ability. In the 14-15 season, Jimmy shot 38% from behind the arc and was becoming a really good catch and shoot guy. That's the 3P% that guys like Beal and KD had this season and higher than Harden's (although Harden had some insane volume). This last season, Jimmy struggled from the 3 for a variety of reasons and dropped to 31%. One of the big reasons were that he started becoming more iso heavy and would take some ill-advised pull up 3's. But the main reason imo was, as we all saw, how Jimmy seemed to come back from his injury too early as the Bulls were floundering and really kinda lost his shot cause he was still playing hurt. Before his injury, Jimmy shot around 33% even with his iso ball and jacked shots. After the injury, he shot 21%. My point really is that I believe that Jimmy will be a solid 3 point shooter for us next season.

"First off, I already realize that the FO was intitially proposing a rebuild, but decided to change their plans--which raises some eyebrows. However, I don't get what the fuss is about our roster.

At point guard, Rajon Rondo can be a step up from Rose if he is able to find open men and dish out passes. Wade may be old, but he's a veteran, and he keeps his body in great condition. Gasol and Dunleavy were both older than Wade, and in much MUCH worse shape. 

Sure, we completely changed our plans--I get it. However, I think our roster is better than it was last year, or at the very least, equivalent. On the flip side, everyone is hyped about the Knicks, but I don't get how they are that much better, if at all. Rondo and Rose are both similar in what they can accomplish on the court, assuming Rondo doesn't get upset with Hoiberg. Butler easily out-talents Porzingis (spelling?). Wade and Carmelo are even, and the remaining roster cancels out as well. Idk, just seems like we just got the short end of the stick in terms of media hype.

"Hey guys! 

My name is Mike, and I'm the owner of the Bulls over on /r/nbalivemockdraft. Basically, it's a fantasy simulation league where games are simmed (and some live streamed!) on NBA 2k17. The league mostly communicates on a big group message app called slack.

I'm the owner and I have a GM but I'd like more active members of a front office.

The offseason has been progressing, and after some mistakes (and successes!), we've found ourself focusing on being a contender while keeping potential. Our current roster is...

Russell Westbrook

Terry Rozier

Shabazz Napier

Tony Allen

Buddy Hield

Randy Foye

Trevor Ariza

Doug McDermott

Paul Zipser

Draymond Green

"Five Thirty Eight released an updated version of their CARMELO NBA Player Projections, you can find it here if you're curious: http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/

So far, here's the rundown of what it projects for all lottery picks:

Ben Simmons: 'Great Prospect' w/ a five year market value of $198.1 million

Brandon Ingram: 'Great Prospect' w/ a five year market value of $92.4 million

Jaylen Brown: 'OK Prospect' w/ a five year market value of $16.2 million

Dragan Bender: N/A

Kris Dunn: 'Great Prospect' w/ a five year market value of $127.1 million

Buddy Hield: 'Good Prospect' w/ a five year market value of $37.4 million

Jamal Murray: 'Good Prospect' w/ a five year market value of $33.3 million

Marquese Chriss: 'Good Prospect' w/ a five year market value of $33.9 million

Jakob Poeltl: 'Great Prospect' w/ a five year market value of $66.6 million

Thon Maker: N/A

Domantas Sabonis: 'Good Prospect' w/ a five year market value of $40.1 million

Taurean Prince: 'OK Prospect' w/ a five year market value of $29.2 million

Georgios Papagiannis: N/A

Denzel Valentine: 'Great Prospect' w/ a five year market value of $113.5 million

Based off of this projection (which of course could be completely wrong), it looks like the Bulls have drafted the player with the 3rd highest five year market value, behind only Simmons and Dunn. 

From only seeing his limited highlights from summer league and his college highlights, he's super polished offensively. I also love that when he comes off of a pick, he immediately looks to pass to an open player. I don't think there's any denying that his IQ is off the charts, thanks to his 4 years under Tom Izzo, arguably one of the greatest basketball coaches in history, college or pro. 

His defense worries me, especially when looking at his projected Defensive +/- being a negative value all the way through the 2023 season.

What do you guys think? Personally, I do think he has the offensive arsenal to at least make a couple of All-Star games down the road of his career. But could we be looking at something much more significant in that he has the 3rd highest projected 5 year market value?

Go Bulls!!!

PS - I highly recommend watching some USA basketball clips of Jimmy. He looks incredibly polished, and I can't wait for the season to start!!!","Denzel Valentine's Ceiling???

>**SPOX**: Mr. Johnson , what have you heard as Bulls insiders of Paul Zipser ? What is known about him in Chicago ?

>**K.C. Johnson**: My knowledge of Paul Zipser is pretty limited to what you can hear from team - circles . I look barely matches the BBL , but of course I have seen his highlights . I appreciate him as athletic winger who also has a good throw and throw himself into it properly . Of course, he has to get used to the pace in the NBA . But it is already clear that the Bulls have the feeling that he already next year something can contribute - especially in the field shooting , where Chicago is not so strong , it should help .

>**SPOX**: The leaders see him as so rather a rotation player as a long-term project ?

>**Johnson**: Zipser will get a chance , that's for sure . The Bulls are trying to create a break and at the same time to remain competitive. But they have the more experienced recruits asked young and athletic players to the side . Paul is one of them .

>**SPOX**: Look for a gap in the Paul can slip ?

>**Johnson**: Zipser has exactly skill-set , which is missing the Bulls . The NBA three should be no problem for him . Chicago had Mike Dunleavy trade to take Dwyane Wade under contract can . Therefore, is there a way for Zipser . With Doug McDermott and Nikola Mirotic of course there are other shooter on the team, but in the new NBA you need as much spacing as you can get.

>**SPOX**: A similar fate as Tibor Pleiß, the Jazz has spent in the D-League for the Utah much time, so do not Zipser flowers?

>**Johnson**: Maybe I need to relativize something my words: He's still a second-round pick. Many of them do not even make it into the roster, let alone in the rotation. He will have to fight, but he will get the chance to prove himself. Then there is, of course, on what he makes of it. However, I have heard the Bulls no longer as positive and hopefully talk about a second-round pick as about Paul.

>**SPOX**: Let's talk about the specific rotation: Could Zipser as backup for Jimmy Butler act?

>**Johnson**: That would be conceivable, but that of course does not happen overnight. Wade will most certainly not as much therefore must be awarded to the wing positions minutes. Erstrundenpick Denzel Valentine is here once may prove, but he also has a big jump from the NCAA to the NBA right. Paul is from Germany, he has played as a professional. Butler will play at the three, McDermott is if the matchup is right, be used both on the three as well as on the four. He will be the first shoot-option of the team. If he plays well and solid defending, he will get next season a lot of playing time.

>**SPOX**: Would you let Bobby Portis start as power forward ? In the Summer League he has shown once again improved.

>**Johnson**: No, I would start with Mirotic on the four . The starting five needs simply be shooting for Rajon Rondo and Wade . This of course is not set in stone , but it will probably be the first option .

>**SPOX**: How Coach Fred Hoiberg your experience with rookies to?

>**Johnson**: He has no particular prejudices. Any player who helps him win, he's operating time. Last year he had to get used to the Head Coaching job in the NBA, but he has worked hard this offseason and would be definitely about his new squad. Surely he will also experiment a bit, but you have nothing to worry about in any case, that he passes his rookies on principle.

>**SPOX**: Hoiberg has been very restrained in the past season and rarely expressed in public. As you have, which is every day at the United Center, seen him?

>**Johnson**: I have Fred both accompanied in his four years as a player of the Bulls and now since last summer as a coach. I know him and his kind so already almost 17 years. He is not a loud type, is rarely the players. He diplomatically and it does not bother him when expressing players and make suggestions. He had a whole new roster, with which he has to work, so much was new for him. Now, he wanted to prove After the disaster last season that he can succeed in the NBA level.

>**SPOX**: How difficult was it to let go for the franchise , the fans and the city , Local Hero Derrick Rose ?

>**Johnson**: Part of the fan base was already longer think that Rose and the Bulls had tried for too long , each other again in . The story was too good to be true : a player from your own town , which has made ​​it the No.1 pick 2008 MVP 2011th And then came 2012 first large incision with the torn ACL . Until then, he could do no wrong , but after that it was just never really fit . Nevertheless, both sides have long tried somehow hinzukriegen it together , but eventually they had to admit that it was too strenuous - and doomed. Much of the fans is happy about the restart .

>**SPOX**: So you think that his career will not be saved?
Johnson: I would not say so. Rose is healthy now and will lie down with security a good year for the Knicks. But you also see that he now takes his final contract year and the Bulls have played it safe by now have traded him. Otherwise they would risk losing him next summer for no consideration.

>**SPOX**: Do you see it also as a right decision?

>**Johnson**: I am one of the few journalists who do not like to play general manager. And I'm not really good at it. (Laughs) No, I think it was not right to trade him now. He was last season for the first time does not hurt for four years, is healthy and motivated. I can understand the management's decision although understand, but I personally would not have done it.

>**SPOX**: What's in it for the Bulls this season?

>**Johnson**: I do not think really a lot of predictions before the season. Therefore, yes to play the games, or not? Many questions can be in advance just not answer. But from a talent perspective, and if they are not hit by a major injury, the Bulls are definitely there in the fight for the playoffs. Of course, it is not a foregone conclusion. Many teams have improved: Boston by the commitment of Al Horford, Toronto through some good moves, and Cleveland is naturally Cleveland. Chicago, however, has to do after last season something good and a completely different team. As I said I do not like predictions. But: The Bulls will reach the playoffs. How is that? (Laughs)

**TL;DR**:  Bulls higher on Zipser than on any second round pick K.C. can remember, K.C. thinks Mirotic will start, K.C. would not have traded Rose but can see why the Bulls did, K.C. thinks the Bulls will reach the playoffs.","K.C.

"First thing people think of Draymond Green an underdog who people thought his ceiling was low and wouldn't become a player who could not help a team with his passing and unselfish play and instincts on offense and defensive instincts due to his lack or no athleticism (given green was a MUCH BETTER defensive player in college).

"The Inquisitr article's already been posted a few days ago, but according to it, we'd have to give up Taj+Nikola and a couple of draft picks; which I think would be worth it if we can re-sign Blake after next season, and that's a big IF. I know it's only speculation, but let's sit back for a moment and imagine a Bulls line-up of:

Rajon Rondo

Dwyane Wade

Jimmy Butler

Blake Griffin

RoLo/Portis(If he keeps up that 3-point shot... wow)

For starters, the Bulls would be the highlight reel team of the season next year alongside GSW. This acquisition would actually transform them from a dark horse playoff team to an unequivocal Finals contender. 
If this team clicks and injuries aren't a huge problem(two more big ifs), the only team in the East who would stand a chance against the Bulls would be Cleveland, but it would take another 16 Finals superhuman-esque performance from LeBron to defeat us. 
I don't know about beating the Warriors(presumably) in the Finals, though. If we win the championship, it will be in seven, hard fought and epic games between these two titans. It'd probably be the most watched Finals since Jordan retired.

What are everyone's thoughts? How excited would you be for a Blake Griffin addition?

"Wanted to do a quick comparison of these 3 players, who are fairly similar in that they are considered probably the best 2 way players in the NBA at the 2/3 positions, behind LeBron and PG13.

Personally, I've been claiming that Jimmy was fairly equal to Kawhi and Klay offensively last year, and I very much recall him being the consensus #2 SG in the NBA until his injury last year, but I wanted to find out if I just had homer glasses on.

The comparison was a lot more interesting than I thought it would be...

I'll compare PPG/RPG/APG/TS%/VORP/TOV and maybe some other random ones.

Players|PPG|RPG|APG|TS%|SPG|VORP|TOV|WS48|DBPM
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
Jimmy|20.9|5.3|4.8|56.2|1.6|3.7|2.0|.177|.3
Klay|22.1|3.4|2.1|59.7|.8|1.8|1.7|.144|2.8
Kawhi|21.2|6.8|2.6|61.6|1.8|6.2|1.5|.277|-2.2

Based on this information, you could conclude that Kawhi was the best of the 3, most efficient, advanced stats loved him, probably the best defender. His only real weakness is passing the ball. 

You could also conclude Jimmy Butler was in fact a better player than Klay Thompson last year in the regular season. 1.9 more rebounds, 2.7 more assists per game, 4% less TS%, better advanced stats as to PER, Win Shares, VORP, etc. 

Klay also had the highest usage percentage of the 3.

Given Klay's playoff performance, he definitely stepped it up from the regular season, without a doubt, but we don't have a playoffs from Jimmy to compare unfortunately.

In conclusion, people are sleeping on Jimmy Butler, stop letting people claim as if it's fact that Klay is better than him.","Butler/Klay/Kawhi...

"With the conclusion of the summer league games and the hype that has built up overnight, I think it's safe to say there's even more to look forward to next season. With all the talk about the shooting woes and the ball-sharing roles that we anticipate from the starters, it's easy to forget that our bench has a potential to greatly affect the outcome of games during the season.

If our current projected starters are Rondo/Wade/Butler/Niko/Lopez, that leaves our bench to be:

* Canaan
* Valentine
* McDermott
* Gibson / Portis
* Portis / Felicio

With the anticipated improvements in play from the returning cast of McBuckets, Felicio, and Portis, our front court stands to see an increase in production. There's also the addition of all-around play by Valentine, an impossible assessment to make at this point while showing promising flashes in summer league. And Canaan will be a serviceable 3pt specialist, his PER (11.1) nearly comparable to E'Twaun (11.4), Brooks (11.8), and Holiday (11.8) while having a much higher 3 point attempt rate.

Granted it's not the bench mob of yesteryear, but the way Fred plays his bench flexibly in order to address match-up needs (particularly spacing), I foresee that we'll see an overall increase in contribution from the bench.

"Alright, so before everyone starts shitting on this post and arguing, let's lay down some realities:

-GarPax has openly said that this team needs to go younger
-Forman has also addressed the issue of needing players who will fit into Hoiberg's motion offense

As of now, I believe these are the 2 glaring issues that the Bulls need to address. Let's start with the first issue, that of the Bulls needing to go younger:

The average age of the Bulls' roster during the 2015-16 season was approximately 27.56 years old (You can check the math yourself here: http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHI/2016.html). That number doesn't seem so bad, considering the Bulls had Hinrich, Dunleavy, and Gasol on the roster, all three at 35 years old. As of today, ESPN has the Bulls' roster listed as: http://espn.go.com/nba/team/roster/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls, giving us an average age of 25.64 years old. What's more is that the Bulls do not have one player at 35 currently on this year's roster, only Dwyane Wade will be 35 this season (more on that to come). No matter how you look at it, the Bulls are in fact substantially younger this season than last. This should hopefully translate to a faster team that can actually run the floor in transition, something that just wasn't very feasible with Gasol manning the middle. Check one for GarPax, looks like they followed through on this promise. 

Now the more complicated issue: how the FUCK are the Bulls supposed to work a starting five of presumably Rondo-Wade-Butler-Mirotic-Lopez if only one guy (Mirotic) is actually able to hit the 3 at a productive rate? Rondo, Wade, and Jimmy are heavy isolation players, and none are great (even decent) 3 point shooters. There's also the issue that the Rondo-Wade-Jimmy 'big 3' could implode horribly in our faces. But here's where things get interesting...

The Bulls just may feature a solid bench, perhaps even one of the premiere benches in the Eastern Conference. Bobby Portis averaged 14 PPG and 11 RPG per 36 minutes, which measures a player's typical line of production if he is to play a full game. For reference, Karl Anthony Towns, rookie of the year last year, put up about 21 and 12 per 36 minutes of action last year. If Bobby is unleashed this year, the Bulls may have found another gem to regain their title-contention status. Their bench will also have Isiah Canaan, Doug McDermott (both premiere 3 point shooters), and Denzel Valetine, who could make a run at All-Rookie First team this year if he lives up to the hype. Not to mention, the Bulls also have Taj Gibson and Cristiano Felicio at their disposal, both who could fight for a starting spot on just about any team in the league right now. In my opinion, things look good for the Bulls in regards to their 2nd and 3rd units.

The starting 5 is another story... 

I honestly don't know how the Rondo-Wade-Jimmy experiment will work. The reality is that none of us really do either. However, let's say for arguments sake that somehow this works, this is what I see happening:

RWJ should (key word, SHOULD) be a terrific perimeter defensive group. They will make it hard for the other team's backcourt to get open shots, and will most definitely create opportunities to get out in the fastbreak (Rondo and Jimmy will especially create these opportunities from all the steals they rack up). Yet, the issue of these 3 players not being able to shoot the 3 ball keeps coming into discussion. In today's NBA game, mostly from the Warriors, everyone loves the 3 pointer. Mathematically speaking, it gives your team such an advantage if you can hit the 3 at a faster rate than your opponent (a team of undersized players cruised to 73 wins utilizing the 3 to its fullest potential). What some people fail to realize is that the 3 pointer also has its drawbacks. For one, you tend to give up size, positioning and rebounding to favor the mobility of the players to get open shots (quite literally, LeBron and Cleveland outmuscled the Warriors by exposing their lack of size in the paint). And let's say the 3 pointer isn't falling in a particular game... the other team is simply going to clog the lane and dare you to keep shooting from outside. And it's here that I think the Bulls may have found a way to implement Hoiberg's motion offense perfectly with RWJ. 

Let's be absolutely fucking real here. Rajon Rondo, by all accounts, is perhaps the best 'pure' point guard in the league. His game relies heavily on finding other open players. Sure, he can have some nights where he puts up 30 points, but he's looking to set up his teammates for open shots, and at a career mark of nearly 9 assists per game, there are very few players who can navigate and control the pace of the game better than Rondo. 

I'm a huge Jimmy Butler fan. I've followed his story since he was drafted 30th overall in 2011. Seeing him go from defensive specialist to one of the best 2 way players in the league is perhaps one of the best feelings as a Bulls fan. He's not a terrific 3 point shooter (or shooter in general, but who's to say that he doesn't improve this facet of his game this offseason?), but he excels at getting to the basket, and getting to the foul line. And towards the end of the year, we saw Jimmy become more and more comfortable running the offense himself and setting up teammates for open looks. If you're reading this, I'm gonna be the first to call it: Jimmy Butler will average ~23 PPG, ~5 RPG, ~5 APG and will be in the MVP running if the Bulls finish in the top 3 of the Eastern Conference. What's more is that if him and Rondo figure things out early, you can surely expect a good amount of Rondo-Butler alley-oops this year. 

Dwyane Wade... Oh how you've tortured us Bulls fans for so long. First you flirt coming to the Bulls in 2010, only to team up with LeBron and repeatedly defeat the Bulls in the playoffs. But it's 2016, and Dwyane Wade is a Chicago Bull (well, for now at least, since he hasn't actually signed his contract yet). Does Dwyane Wade have much left in the tank? Statistics don't think so, as five thiry eight's player projection for Dwyane Wade this season has his efficiency topping off similarly to Kobe Bryant's 2014 campaign. But make no mistake, Dwyane Wade, in my humble opinion, is the 3rd greatest shooting guard in NBA history. It's an honor to have him suit up with the Bulls this season. And yes, his age and injury history have me worried a little bit. However, Wade is still one of the best in the league at getting to the rim and getting to the foul line. And, his mid-range game is perhaps still among the best in the game today, even at age 34.  

Maybe, just maybe, here’s how things can shape up: The starting 5 will have Rondo primarily handle the ball, where he’ll have the freedom of not one, but 2 of the best rim attackers in the NBA. Surely, the defenses will get bent when trying to handle both Wade and Jimmy trying to attack the paint. If the defense starts to shy back a bit and clog the paint, then there’s Wade and Jimmy’s midrange game, coupled with Nikola’s streaky 3 point shooting that can further stretch the floor. Today’s game heavily favors the 3 point shot, but the Bulls now have 3 play makers that can make plays for each other. My point is, don’t assume that spacing necessarily means the 3 point shot. Sure, it’s a nice tool to have at your disposal, but the real spacing comes from player movement, setting screens and getting switches for favorable match ups on the offensive end, and you can get very creative with Wade’s midrange game and Jimmy’s ability to get to the basket, made all the more scarier now that Rondo, arguably the best passer in the NBA, will be finding them open looks. Once the game progresses, the lineup can get stacked, featuring any combination of RWJ while implementing a bench with untapped potential. 

Clearly, we’re still in summer league and a ways away from the season actually starting. All of this is speculation. I wish I knew what was in store for us as Bulls fans, but we’ll just have to wait and see when the season starts. 

I don’t expect HUGE things this year. This team will probably top out at 50 wins, but the 45-48 range sounds more likely, given that we don’t know if the overall team DER will improve and we don’t know how the team’s OER will improve now that the starting 5 is virtually an entirely new team. But GarPax did in fact follow through on their word, the team is definitely younger now. And if Wade and Rondo don’t work out, both can leave after this year. But let’s say that this RWJ ‘big 3’ does find success, even if it’s an early playoff exit. 2017 features a STACKED free agent class featuring Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook, Steph Curry, and yours truly, Derrick Rose. GarPax also brought in some key players that can fit Hoiberg’s motion offense. Isiah Canaan and Denzel Valentine should benefit especially from the ball movement, but it’ll be the play of Rajon Rondo I believe that determines all of this. Doc Rivers seemed to have a good relationship with Rondo and it got them a championship. Rick Carlisle and Rondo had a relationship as stable as the Titanic, and it lead to Rondo’s messy departure from the team. But from what has been reported, Rondo and Hoiberg have already gotten off to a good start in terms of watching film sessions together. 

All I can say is, I’m all in with GarPax’s plan, even if not everyone is pleased with them. Keep in mind that GarPax did draft Jimmy Butler virtually out of thin air, drafted Niko, Dougie, Bobby and now Denzel Valentine. What I’m really interested in, however, is Felicio’s development as the team’s center of the future. He is already the strongest guy on the team, and seems to get double-doubles about as easy as Steph Curry can hit half court buzzer-beaters. BULL-ieve in this team, Bulls Nation!","Believe in GarPax!!! Alright, so before everyone starts shitting on this post and arguing, let's lay down some realities:

-GarPax has openly said that this team needs to go younger
-Forman has also addressed the issue of needing players who will fit into Hoiberg's motion offense

As of now, I believe these are the 2 glaring issues that the Bulls need to address. Let's start with the first issue, that of the Bulls needing to go younger:

The average age of the Bulls' roster during the 2015-16 season was approximately 27.56 years old (You can check the math yourself here: http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHI/2016.html). That number doesn't seem so bad, considering the Bulls had Hinrich, Dunleavy, and Gasol on the roster, all three at 35 years old. As of today, ESPN has the Bulls' roster listed as: http://espn.go.com/nba/team/roster/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls, giving us an average age of 25.64 years old. What's more is that the Bulls do not have one player at 35 currently on this year's roster, only Dwyane Wade will be 35 this season (more on that to come). No matter how you look at it, the Bulls are in fact substantially younger this season than last. This should hopefully translate to a faster team that can actually run the floor in transition, something that just wasn't very feasible with Gasol manning the middle. Check one for GarPax, looks like they followed through on this promise. 

Now the more complicated issue: how the FUCK are the Bulls supposed to work a starting five of presumably Rondo-Wade-Butler-Mirotic-Lopez if only one guy (Mirotic) is actually able to hit the 3 at a productive rate? Rondo, Wade, and Jimmy are heavy isolation players, and none are great (even decent) 3 point shooters. There's also the issue that the Rondo-Wade-Jimmy 'big 3' could implode horribly in our faces. But here's where things get interesting...

The Bulls just may feature a solid bench, perhaps even one of the premiere benches in the Eastern Conference. Bobby Portis averaged 14 PPG and 11 RPG per 36 minutes, which measures a player's typical line of production if he is to play a full game. For reference, Karl Anthony Towns, rookie of the year last year, put up about 21 and 12 per 36 minutes of action last year. If Bobby is unleashed this year, the Bulls may have found another gem to regain their title-contention status. Their bench will also have Isiah Canaan, Doug McDermott (both premiere 3 point shooters), and Denzel Valetine, who could make a run at All-Rookie First team this year if he lives up to the hype. Not to mention, the Bulls also have Taj Gibson and Cristiano Felicio at their disposal, both who could fight for a starting spot on just about any team in the league right now. In my opinion, things look good for the Bulls in regards to their 2nd and 3rd units.

The starting 5 is another story... 

I honestly don't know how the Rondo-Wade-Jimmy experiment will work. The reality is that none of us really do either. However, let's say for arguments sake that somehow this works, this is what I see happening:

RWJ should (key word, SHOULD) be a terrific perimeter defensive group. They will make it hard for the other team's backcourt to get open shots, and will most definitely create opportunities to get out in the fastbreak (Rondo and Jimmy will especially create these opportunities from all the steals they rack up). Yet, the issue of these 3 players not being able to shoot the 3 ball keeps coming into discussion. In today's NBA game, mostly from the Warriors, everyone loves the 3 pointer. Mathematically speaking, it gives your team such an advantage if you can hit the 3 at a faster rate than your opponent (a team of undersized players cruised to 73 wins utilizing the 3 to its fullest potential). What some people fail to realize is that the 3 pointer also has its drawbacks. For one, you tend to give up size, positioning and rebounding to favor the mobility of the players to get open shots (quite literally, LeBron and Cleveland outmuscled the Warriors by exposing their lack of size in the paint). And let's say the 3 pointer isn't falling in a particular game... the other team is simply going to clog the lane and dare you to keep shooting from outside. And it's here that I think the Bulls may have found a way to implement Hoiberg's motion offense perfectly with RWJ. 

Let's be absolutely fucking real here. Rajon Rondo, by all accounts, is perhaps the best 'pure' point guard in the league. His game relies heavily on finding other open players. Sure, he can have some nights where he puts up 30 points, but he's looking to set up his teammates for open shots, and at a career mark of nearly 9 assists per game, there are very few players who can navigate and control the pace of the game better than Rondo. 

I'm a huge Jimmy Butler fan. I've followed his story since he was drafted 30th overall in 2011. Seeing him go from defensive specialist to one of the best 2 way players in the league is perhaps one of the best feelings as a Bulls fan. He's not a terrific 3 point shooter (or shooter in general, but who's to say that he doesn't improve this facet of his game this offseason?), but he excels at getting to the basket, and getting to the foul line. And towards the end of the year, we saw Jimmy become more and more comfortable running the offense himself and setting up teammates for open looks. If you're reading this, I'm gonna be the first to call it: Jimmy Butler will average ~23 PPG, ~5 RPG, ~5 APG and will be in the MVP running if the Bulls finish in the top 3 of the Eastern Conference. What's more is that if him and Rondo figure things out early, you can surely expect a good amount of Rondo-Butler alley-oops this year. 

Dwyane Wade... Oh how you've tortured us Bulls fans for so long. First you flirt coming to the Bulls in 2010, only to team up with LeBron and repeatedly defeat the Bulls in the playoffs. But it's 2016, and Dwyane Wade is a Chicago Bull (well, for now at least, since he hasn't actually signed his contract yet). Does Dwyane Wade have much left in the tank? Statistics don't think so, as five thiry eight's player projection for Dwyane Wade this season has his efficiency topping off similarly to Kobe Bryant's 2014 campaign. But make no mistake, Dwyane Wade, in my humble opinion, is the 3rd greatest shooting guard in NBA history. It's an honor to have him suit up with the Bulls this season. And yes, his age and injury history have me worried a little bit. However, Wade is still one of the best in the league at getting to the rim and getting to the foul line. And, his mid-range game is perhaps still among the best in the game today, even at age 34.  

Maybe, just maybe, here’s how things can shape up: The starting 5 will have Rondo primarily handle the ball, where he’ll have the freedom of not one, but 2 of the best rim attackers in the NBA. Surely, the defenses will get bent when trying to handle both Wade and Jimmy trying to attack the paint. If the defense starts to shy back a bit and clog the paint, then there’s Wade and Jimmy’s midrange game, coupled with Nikola’s streaky 3 point shooting that can further stretch the floor. Today’s game heavily favors the 3 point shot, but the Bulls now have 3 play makers that can make plays for each other. My point is, don’t assume that spacing necessarily means the 3 point shot. Sure, it’s a nice tool to have at your disposal, but the real spacing comes from player movement, setting screens and getting switches for favorable match ups on the offensive end, and you can get very creative with Wade’s midrange game and Jimmy’s ability to get to the basket, made all the more scarier now that Rondo, arguably the best passer in the NBA, will be finding them open looks. Once the game progresses, the lineup can get stacked, featuring any combination of RWJ while implementing a bench with untapped potential. 

Clearly, we’re still in summer league and a ways away from the season actually starting. All of this is speculation. I wish I knew what was in store for us as Bulls fans, but we’ll just have to wait and see when the season starts. 

I don’t expect HUGE things this year. This team will probably top out at 50 wins, but the 45-48 range sounds more likely, given that we don’t know if the overall team DER will improve and we don’t know how the team’s OER will improve now that the starting 5 is virtually an entirely new team.

I have heard bunch of people saying, Rondo's best days are behind him.Has rondo really lost it since his Boston days?He averaged almost 12/12/6 last year. Only two players in entire NBA last year averaged 10 points 10 rebounds and 5 assists. Russell Westbrook and Rajon Rondo.

Only 4 players averaged double digit assists. WB, wall, Rondo, CP3 and Rondo. That's crazy good company to be in.

Rondo is a great facilitator and has unbelievable bbiq. 

I honestly think he will do a world of good to Jimmy, Niko, McD and Portis. As much as I love Rose, he was never a great facilitator and just above average(?) court vision, which really hurt our young players development.

I think, at that price, under those circumstances, Garpax had an excellent pickup for a very good price.

I have heard bunch of people saying, Rondo's best days are behind him.Has rondo really lost it since his Boston days?He averaged almost 12/12/6 last year. Only two players in entire NBA last year averaged 10 points 10 rebounds and 5 assists. Russell Westbrook and Rajon Rondo.

Only 4 players averaged double digit assists. WB, wall, Rondo, CP3 and Rondo. That's crazy good company to be in.

Rondo is a great facilitator and has unbelievable bbiq. 

I honestly think he will do a world of good to Jimmy, Niko, McD and Portis. As much as I love Rose, he was never a great facilitator and just above average(?) court vision, which really hurt our young players development.

I think, at that price, under those circumstances, Garpax had an excellent pickup for a very good price.

"Haven't seen anyone else do this so here it goes.


Among the highest paid players from last year, here are the best and the worst from 4 distinct salary brackets (based on % of cap)



* 28-35%

Best Value: James, Durant

Worst Value: Rose, Bryant

* 23-28%

Best Value: Westbrook, Kawhi Leonard

Worst Value: Kanter, Wes Matthews

* 20-23%

Best Value: Hayward, Draymond Green

Worst Value: Hibbert, Eric Gordon

* 17-20%

Best Value: Kyle Lowry, Al Horford, Kemba Walker

Worst Value: Pekovic, Noah




Now here are the free agents that signed **with other teams** this year in those brackets, based on 17-18 salaries and projected cap (I'll explain why below).



* 28-35%

Above max salary

* 23-28%

Durant, Horford, Wade, Howard 

* 20-23%

Barnes, Chandler 

* 17-20%

Anderson, Noah, Deng, Evan Turner, Biyombo



The reason I did this was to try to get a more honest evaluation of our free agent hits and misses.  I can't really consider players who re-signed to other teams as true free agents because few of them seriously considered other suitors even if they may have dipped their toes in the market.  Just look at how many resigned on the first day of FA (Bazemore, Conley, Batum, Drummond, Derozan, Beal, etc. etc.).  None of these could really be considered FA ""misses"" by other suitors.



Here are a couple takeaways:

* In terms of player value/contract, this perspective really makes it look like Rose and Noah dragged us down last year.  This is to say nothing of their potential, I think they both have potential to be great this year and I would have loved to have them, but what we got from them last year is nothing near what we payed for them.  Hope it works out better for the Knicks.

* The Wade signing does not look great given his age, kind of like the last Kobe contract, but there are some big differences: first, Kobe's 35% is much worse than Wades 23%, second, we have jimmy, Rolo and Rondo on pretty good contracts so we could afford to splurge on Wade short-term, still preserving our ability to add talent.

* None of the other signings look *that* bad, the floor on this year's %23-28 signees looks higher than Kanter and Matthews for the most part, the floor on the %20-23 definitely better than Hibbert/Eric Gordon, and some pretty low floor players in the %17-20 range but each one has a ceiling squarely within that value-range based on previous seasons.

* Of all of the deals this year (besides Deng and Noah who I would have taken chances on out of homerism) I think I would have liked for us to sign Barnes the most, plenty of upside, IMO, already a solid defender, when you look at his salary compared to percentage of the cap and considering how much we're spending on other starters, it's not that bad.

* FWIW only 11 of these high level signees signed to new teams and we got one of them.
