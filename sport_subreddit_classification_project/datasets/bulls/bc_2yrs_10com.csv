He also said none of the big free agents available will be interested in the Bulls (big shock there), but that there's a possibility they'd get involved if Leonard becomes available.

"According to NBADraftGod, who’s come out of pretty much nowhere this summer and broken every major news story and draft rumor despite having no sports news network base, it’s looking fairly likely that we face a scenario where Bagley is the guy that falls to 7. 

He’s a true 4 with little likelihood to move to a 5 in the NBA. However, his outside jumpshot is improving and his ball handling and athleticism are off the charts, so it’s possible he could be a Giannis type of SF later down the line. He has little feel for rim protection but his perimeter instincts on defense are quite advanced. 

Are you keen on keeping him? If so, what are your plans for the lineup moving forward? If not, what would you try to trade him for, and to who?

"With the Bulls picking 7th (and 22nd), there is a chance that all of the clear cut, legit talent within the draft is gone before the Bulls pick.

Would you go for the players projected to go high or do you take a risk and pick a high risk, high reward guy. 

I personally really like Zhaire Smith, but with WCJ, Sexton, and Trae Young on the board in this hypothetical. I feel like Smith, who has ridiculous upside, would be a stretch at seventh overall but he would definitely get picked before the bulls next pick at 22.

Bamba or MPJ would be my dream, especially if we didn't have to trade down. Bamba seems to love the organization and loves the idea of playing with Lauri and I think we all could agree that would be an outstanding front court if the bulls could secure it.

So you think the Bulls can still draft an all Star talent if they keep their picks, or if the draft goes as planned, Will the Bulls have to make trades to get a player that will help them get out of the rebuild and win some games?","Who would you take?

Pick 22 & Justin Holiday to DEN for Faried & 14

#2018 Draft:

(Disclaimer: Of course I'm not guaranteeing this is how the picks are going to fall, there's some time between now and the draft and we could potentially see a trade into the top 3. Currently going off who is projected to be the pick as it stands)

1 - PHX - Ayton

2 - SAC - Doncic 

3 - ATL - Bamba or JJJ (possible wildcard pick)

*With the #4 pick in the NBA Draft The Chicago Bulls select...*

A) [Mohammed Bamba](https://youtu.be/0T5Frwes9AA) - C - Texas

*Why Bamba?*

> Bamba might not be as well rounded as JJJ, but its difficult to ignore his freakish measurables and the potential. There's NBA stars, and then there's NBA legends, and in my opinion, Bamba's potential is the closest thing to the latter after Ayton and Doncic.

Pro comparison: Rudy Gobert

B) [Jaren Jackson Jr](https://youtu.be/A4v1sM8aomI)- C - Michigan St

*Why Jackson?*

> JJJ has the physical and the mental tools to be an elite defender in the NBA. He's the consensus best player available and the best fit for the team. I'm sure there's going to be some users who will argue that he should be ranked over Bamba, which makes this a good plan b to have.

Pro Comparison: Serge Ibaka

#Free Agency:

[Resign Zach Lavine (3 years, $60M)](https://youtu.be/qc5cmcfgfpA)

Why Lavine?

> Its more money than he's truly earned, but you're paying for the potential. Lavine had his fair share of struggles during the limited games he played in 2017, but thats was kinda expected coming off an ACL tear in a new offense. If Lavine can get back on track and improve on his consitency, this contract could end up being great value.


# 2018 Roster

**Dunn**/Grant

**Lavine**/Nwaba

**Valentine**/Zipser

**Markkanen**/Faried

**Bamba or JJJ**/Lopez

>  It's not a win now roster, but it could make a playoff push in a weak eastern conference. The plan is to be competitive enough to lure in one of the big name free agents in 2019 (Klay Thompson, Devin Booker, Kawhi Leonard, possibly kyrie or Kemba could be an option as well if the Dunn project doesnt work out) and I think with these moves, we are in position to do so with a promising young foundation with a lot of money to offer.

Marcus is a winner and comes in with an established role that'd fit a need for the team. There's even a chance he's got more development in his game if given more opportunity.

But my narrative back then is that, Bulls will have to use Jimmy to lure 2018 free agents to retool.

&nbsp;

I am glad I was wrong.

&nbsp;

Eventhough we lose Jimmy, we gained better financial and roster flexibility that  enable us to add more talent.

&nbsp;

With Lebron on the verge of getting sweeped on back-to-back finals, there's no question this is his last dance with the Cavs. Though he can stay in the east and jump in Sixers bandwagon, there's no denying the east losses a contender. Sixers are up and coming and they will be a legit contender with or without Bron.

&nbsp;

This increases the Bulls chance to get in the playoffs next season.

&nbsp;

Bulls arguably can get in the playoffs last season, if they have a healthy roster.


Now they are primed to keep the same team(Nwaba, Vonleh?) they had last season. And with a healthy roster, better chemistry(no boxing match this season bobby) and added talent(7th and 22nd picks), Bulls are going to be that up and coming team the east needs to watch for.

&nbsp;

Up and coming, because Bulls will have cap flexibility to sign a max free agent in 2019. Two max in 2021, if they can move contracts.

"If the Bulls could work out a favorable short term contract for Mario Hezonja, do you think it’s better than extending Nwaba contract or cutting other payers? Hezonja seems to be getting accustomed to the NBA and had a well improved stint in the second half of the season this year. He will be a project, but it can pay off dividends.

I feel like this scenario would be highly plausible if MPJ was selected earlier in the round and the Bulls deciding to draft a big man such as Bamba or Carter for their #7 pick.

Bulls weakest position is the SF Position. Hezonja can fill the void in the position in which the current players Holiday, Nwaba, and Valentine are a bit too undersized for. I also believe the Bulls were to draft another wing player such as Bates-Diop or Hutchison. This will move Holiday and Valentine to the SG position, which I think they are better suited to play.

In the end, we can expect this move to fill the void in the SF position, security, and depth. Hopefully, Hezonja and #22 pick will develop well under the Bulls. If not, we can use the 2020 Free Agency to fill our needs.","What do you guys think of signing Mario Hezonja to the Bulls?

"We should be able to choose from either Bamba, MPJ or Trae Young, unless the FO has other plans. That gets me really excited. I think all of these players have superstar potential, and as a team that's likely in for a few more years of rebuilding, these are the types of players we should be shooting for. 

As a team that has lost its defensive identity, **Bamba** would go a long way towards bringing that back. He would complement Markkanen really well, and if he develops his offensive game in combination with his incredible physical tools and defensive skills, he can be one of the best bigs in the league. 

I know this sub is really high on **MPJ**, and I can definitely see why. He very well could've been an option at #1 if it hadn't been for his injury. The guy can really shoot the ball, and the Durant comparisons, while that's quite a ceiling, actually seem to fit pretty well. 

On the flip side, we have **Trae Young**. A few weeks ago it looked like this sub would burn to the ground if we were to draft him, but it seems like some people are sort of warming up to the idea. Personally this kid really excites me. It's fair to think that he'll likely be a liability on defense, but his size is similar to that of several successful NBA point guards. I think it's much more important to focus on what he does bring to the table, which is Curry-esque range and elite playmaking ability. Obviously we already have Dunn which would make this scenario tricky, but that situation will sort itself out later in the rebuild. 

Anyway, this is pretty much just me rambling, so feel free to do the same in the comments. For those of you who are WCJ fans, I've actually been warming up to the idea of drafting him as well, but he seems like the ""safe"" pick, which isn't what we should be shooting for at this point in the rebuild.

I don't think Franklin classifies in the same catergory as Trae Young. Though listed 6'1, Franklin has superior length and athleticism. But Franklin doesn't shoot as efficient as the ones listed above. Still interesting measurements, as we can contrast his length and athleticism vs Trae Young's skillset. Both have comparable weight and court vision. But it would be unfair to compare Franklin's basketball IQ to Trae. The closest to Franklin's BBIQ is I think CP3.

I would put Mike Conley in the exceptions, as he's skillset is different than Trae. Though the measurements are comparable. Conley has length(almost 6'6 wingspan) and relies on his athleticism. Both of these are what impacts the game for him.


&nbsp;

**Ricky Rubio, 6-5 with 6-9 wingspan**


I didn't include Rubio, because I can't get his accurate measurement. I researched and I found that he is 6'5 with 6'9 wingspan. But I am unsure of those measurements. It's hard to get a hold of Rubio's measurements, as he didn't join the draft combine.

In addition, he's the second youngest prospect in the top 10 after JJJ and is almost a full year younger than Bamba and MPJ. Why do people think he has such a low ceiling?",14,12,Why are people so down on WCJ's upside?,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/8of1rt/why_are_people_so_down_on_wcjs_upside/

"Idk if its just me but I really do not like the idea of taking Mo Bamba with the 7 pick in this draft. I understand that it would create ""the back court of the future"" like he said but with the NBA moving less and less for big men I feel like Wendell Jr. would be a much more modern pick. Realistically shouldnt your best lineup of the future have Lauri at the 5? He couldnt play there for a whole season especially without adding some bulk but him at the 5 in a lineup with Wendell playing would be better than him and bamba 

Also before anyone gets too mad MPJ is my number one lol","Mo Bamba fit Idk if its just me but I really do not like the idea of taking Mo Bamba with the 7 pick in this draft.

"**My top 7 mock draft depicts why a certain team will draft a certain player**

&nbsp;

**1) Suns, DeAndre Ayton** - I don't think I have to explain this further. Ayton is the safest pick with the least bust probability. With his physical tools, he can impact the game already.

&nbsp;

**2) Kings, Luka Doncic** - Luka is too talented to pass up. Given Vlade's familiarity with European prospects, there's no way they can't work this out. Kings desperately need a franchise player. And though DeAaron Fox play PG, he is not the play maker Luka Doncic is. And besides Fox and Doncic, they only have Bogdan Bogdanovic to make plays. Fox, Hield and Doncic with Bogdanovic off the bench would be an interesting core for this long starving Kings.

&nbsp;

**3) Atlanta Hawks, Jaren Jackson Jr** - Hawks assistant GM Jeff Peterson [admitted](https://www.ajc.com/sports/basketball/draft-hawks-assistant-jeff-peterson-marvin-bagley-iii/sPkecnC4zLU3raLzw8iZyH/) Marvin Bagley III and John Collins have similarity. John Collins is replaceable, but not with the 3rd overall pick. Bagley has short arms and is thin to be a center. Being a tweener, I don't think Bagley could be a franchise cornerstone(which Hawks need right now) with the Hawks. The way I see it, Bagley needs WCJ in Duke to be effective. WCJ covered post defense and shot blocking for Bagley.


JJJ on the other hand is just scratching his abilities. Though Bagley is the NBA ready prospect, JJJ has higher ceiling given his versatility and age. Hawks are far away from competing, and JJJ will have a lot of time and opportunity to develop with them. Especially with Schroder running the point. Brings me back to 1998 where Nash and Dirk help each other improved.

&nbsp;

**4) Memphis Grizzlies, Marvin Bagley III** - Because their fan base still remember drafting Hasheem Thabeet, they can't afford to draft Bamba. Marvin Bagley III is a perfect complement to Marc Gasol. He also fills Grizzlies dire need on PF position. NBA ready rookie that could contribute right away. Would also provide a good foundation for Grizzlies next core, because he is under Marc Gasol his entire rookie years. Perfect fit for both parties IMO.

&nbsp;

**5) Dallas Mavericks, Mo Bamba** - Great complement for DSJ. Offensively, he's a DSJ PnR/PnP partner. Defensively, we all know he can protect the rim and block/alter shots. Will benefit a lot from having Dirk around. Will be able to extend Dirk's career, carrying most of the big man load. Mutual fit for both sides.

&nbsp;

**6) Orlando Magic, Trae Young** - It seems like Magic are rebuilding with Steve Clifford. There is something to this statement

> [“There is a difference between being able to impact a player and just coaching him,” Clifford said. “I want to be able to impact each one of these guys in the right way. If you want to gain the right type of credibility so you can have the right impact on them and the type of partnership where the two of you come to a common place on how they have to play to play well and the team can function well when they are on the floor, I have to be up to speed and an expert on their game. I’m not that yet.”](https://orlandomagicdaily.com/2018/05/30/orlando-magics-clean-slate-begins-steve-clifford/)

that tells me he will restart with a floor general. Steve Clifford had a good track record with Kemba Walker. Though Walker didn't really turn into a floor general(because he is more of a scorer), he became Charlotte's leader. Walker was basically the one who dictates the team.


Clifford is familiar with the franchise, as he is an assistant with the Magic during Dwight era. With this level of familiarity, I expect Steve Clifford have been given the keys to build the roster. This just screams a Trae Young pick IMO.

&nbsp;

Why? 


Because Trae Young and Kemba Walker has comparable measurements. And Steve Clifford already succeeded with Kemba Walker.

&nbsp;

Player|Height w/o Shoes|Height w/ Shoes|Weight|Wingspan|Standing Reach|Body Fat %|Hand Length|Hand Width 
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
[Kemba Walker](https://www.si.com/nba/2013/12/13/draft-measurements)|5-11 1/2|6-1|184|6-3 1/2|7-7 1/2|5.9|8.0|9.0

&nbsp;

Steve Clifford proved he can maximize a player talents, even with their physical limitation. Kemba Walker being a two time all-star, is a great example of that.

This is a good narrative to elevate Lebron's greatness, but a nugget that people seem to forget is that he dug this grave himself. Retaining JR(who's still solid sometimes), Tristan Thompson, Shumpert, etc., hand-picking his coach, GM, probably the ball boys too, and all the recent trade acquisitions being run past him first: these are all on Lebron. Lebron should know by now, through his tenure with the Heat, that if you are the favorite to come out of the east, all manner of ring-chasers come out of the wood work to play with you.

Could you imagine if Jordan had LeGM control over his 90's Bulls teams? He would've realized he needed a core of himself/Scottie/3-point shooting PG/Defensive Bigmen and would have dominated. However, Phil and Krause did a pretty good job of drafting talent and implementing that talent into a system around Jordan. Jordan would know who deserved to paid, and who would continue to give effort in the long haul. 

I know Jordan has been a pretty bad owner for the Hornets, but he's likely just too far from the process to get a good handle on talent recognition. But as a player, Jordan knew exactly what kind of teammates he needed(e.g. Steve Kerr).

"Hey guys,

I wrote a few breakdowns of rookies that I thought you might be interested in. Each of them has analysis/thoughts, stats, Synergy stats, and the only one without clips is Miles Bridges (working on that).

A brief about me - interned in the front office of a team helping with scouting, stats and analytics, contracts, and with coaches when they needed. Before that, was scouted for D3 but ended up at Vanderbilt where I was going to walk on before senior year (12-13)...before back spasms came the day before the open gym. Then went to law school where I focused my studies on IP/contract related work.

Trying to get back...badly, so I've been networking (and working) since graduating. Spoke with execs/personnel in almost every FO (including the Kings) and got some damn good responses on the stuff I've put out there. Heading out to Vegas during SL to watch games and meet with FO personnel. Hopefully I land a job with a team before (or at SL) and go from there.

*I know I need to keep them shorter...I'm working on it. Miles, Mikal, and Bamba are in paragraph form vs the bullet point that I use with Jackson and Huerter (and will continue to use) 

*Also, please, if you like the work, spread this around the internet - Twitter, other forums, Facebook, Instagram, etc. - and sign up for updates if you'd like!

**Next article should be on Robert Williams (and then Knox) and hopefully will have it out shortly.

>PnR Roll/Pop

Efficiency – PnR – .773 overall, 20th percentile; PnP .667PPP, 24th percentile

Although at this point Bamba is still raw in this area, I am looking forward to his progression here going forward. He shows fluidity in catching and shooting in the PnP and shows some ability in the PnR. However, because of his frame, he can still get bumped off of his spots in the PnR. As he continues to get stronger, I expect him to improve here. His high reach makes him a great lob target in the paint, as he is able to rise above almost any defender thrown at him. This also makes the possibility of an overthrow slightly lower.

Even though this was not a PnR, this clip perfectly shows how even bad passes can lead to buckets for his team because of how long and athletic he is.

Brief Summary:
Projection

I think Bamba will be able to come in and impact the game defensively the second he steps onto the court. Offensively, he will likely be relegated to 15 and in for the first year or two, but he should be able to expand his range past that going forward (he’s been hitting the college three this year and has made major improvements from his senior year in high school). All in all, I see an elite defensive big who is solid offensively, but not a key hub or focus (unless it is as a Gobert screener, who screens on almost every single play the Jazz run). One way or another, Bamba will leave his imprint on the game.","Bamba, Both Bridges, Huerter, and Justin Jackson Breakdown Hey guys,

"**Intro:**

Greetings, my name is Tyler. In this 2018 NBA draft, there are a lot of interesting prospects with many different skill sets and accomplishments. Luka Doncic is exhibiting himself as the best European prospect in history winning the EuroLeague championship, Euroleague MVP and the Final Four MVP. Mohamed Bamba has posted the longest wingspan in the history of the NBA combine. Combined with being second in the NCAA Division 1 in blocked shots per game and very solid mobility, he has the potential to be a dominant force at the NBA level. Uber-athletic double double machines Marvin Bagley and Deandre Ayton cannot be overlooked as both have athleticism that is rare in players 6'11 and taller. The mystery surrounding Michael Porter Jr with his back injury and how much that will affect him is interesting as well. He was an absolutely dominant force at the high school level. He led his team in high school to a perfect 29-0 record resulting in them winning the Washington Class 3A State Championship. Porter Jr averaged a monster 36.2 ppg and 13.6 rebounds a game.He was the number 1 player in the 2017 ESPN 100 class before Marvin Bagley reclassified. Jaren Jackson Jr. showed amazing potential in his limited minutes and touches at Michigan State. He established himself as a dominant shot blocker at the college level, and that skill looks very translatable to the NBA. He averaged 3 blocks in only 21.8 minutes of play, so his per-36-minute block rate is an absurd 4.95 blocks per 36 minutes. Combine that with a very solid 39% 3 point percentage in college, and he has the tools to be a great offensive and defensive front court player. Even with all the amazing potential of all the players in this draft, my favorite prospect in this draft is Trae Young and I am going to explain why that is.

**Passing:**

Trae Young has displayed masterful passing skills at Oklahoma combined with excellent court vision. On a subpar Oklahoma team that went 11-20 the year befor, Trae Young joined the team. With no other creators on the team Trae Young was under a lot of pressure to create for other teammates, set them up and put them in the best position to succeed while creating for himself. Trae Young averaged 8.7 assists to lead the nation in assists at points of the season with his assist total being higher than 9 per game. His turnover rate of 5.2 per a game jumps out and can cause concern. Turnovers are something that Trae has to work on at the next level. But if we compare it to other guards in this draft, his turnover rate is not as alarming as it seems. Using College Basketball Reference, I compared Trae Young's assist to turnover ratio to other top point guards. Collin Sexton averages 3.6 assist to 2.8 turnovers per a game which indicates that he has an assist to turnover ratio of 1.286 compared to Trae Young's ratio of 1.673. Even John Wall, a guard known notoriously for his passing skills posted a slightly lower assist to turnover ratio of 1.625, with far superior talent surrounding him. DeMarcus Cousins, Eric Bledsoe, and Patrick Patterson were all part of the 2009-2010 Kentucky Wildcat's team. All of them NBA players currently. Anybody on the Sooners basketball team that Trae Young played on would be lucky to be in the G league.

**Scoring:**

Trae Young, like Stephen Curry today in the NBA and in college is far more better at shooting than at getting the basketball in to the bucket. Trae Young averaged 27.4 ppg and 8.7 apg - the only person in NCAA history to lead in ppg and assists per game. He had arguably the greatest season for a freshman point guard in NCAA history and one of the great individual seasons in NCAA history. He shot a true shooting percentage of .593 which is a very big feat when you see that he was double teamed 43.7 % of his touches past half court. The next highest player is Stephen Curry at 31.4 % of his touches, which puts Trae Young up with some of the biggest scoring threats in NCAA history, which is an amazing feat, considering he was just a couple of months removed from high school with what we consider subpar teammates in the PAC 12, with many of Trae Young shot's coming off the dribble. In comparison, Collin Sexton shot a true shooting percentage of.576 and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander shot a true shooting percentage of .586 with lower usage rates and being double teamed less. One very underrated part of Trae Young game is his ability to get to the free throw line. He averaged 8.56 attempts a game shooting a very high 86.1%, meaning he makes 7.4 free throws a game. He has very underrated quickness and very good ball handling skills, so he is able to get into the lane and the paint at an effective rate. Trae has, at his disposal, a deceptive hesitation dribble than can keep his defenders on his toes. One big thing for Trae to work on is that he needs to finish at the rim at a higher percentage. He also has very few midrange attempts in college. The NBA is moving away from midrange shots, but at certain points that could be problematic. For his age he does have a very impressive floater that he can hit from all corners of the basketball court.

**Shooting:**

Trae Young is known as a knockdown shooter winning the McDonald’s All American 2017 3 point contest. He established himself as a top level shooter in the ESPN 100 class. He has the ability to knock down shots the moment he crosses half court, which is the main reason he was double teamed at such a high rate in college. He finished the season shooting 36% from 3 making 3.7 out of 10.3 attempts per game. He was shooting in the low 40% at the beginning of the year but as defenses started to really double team him and the degree of difficulty of 3 pointers attempted started to rise, he really lowered his percentages. Overall, he is a very underrated catch and shoot player. On his 58 catch and shoot 3 pointers in college, he averaged an absurd 1.4 ppp, which is about 46% on catch and shoot. On off-the-dribble 3 pointers he was in the low 30% range. His three point percentage would be much better overall if he had teammates that could run or create an offense which would allow Trae Young to have more catch and shoot opportunities. Players with really good free throw percentages tend to overall turn out to be very good shooters in the NBA. Consistent free throw shooting usually indicates better and more consistent form and he shot .861 from the line. I believe Trae Young will be able to benefit a lot from the increased spacing that is in the NBA. If he is double teamed in the NBA there are players with the talent level to make the opposing team pay for double teaming Trae. This would help Trae in catch and shoot scoring and overall efficiency. One major reason Trae Young's shot will work in the NBA is that he has a very quick one shot motion like Curry which makes his shot much harder to judge and contest, unlike someone like Jimmer Freddette who has a much slower two shot motion which does not go well for unathletic players at the NBA level.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, I think in a way Trae Young is becoming underrated in this draft. Even though he is undersized at 6'1.7 in shoes and has a 6'3 wingspan at 176 lb, in comparison, Stephen Curry measured 6'3.5 with a 6'3 wingspan and weighed 183 lb at the combine. He has a very good handle, he is excellent off the dribble, along with his shooting skills and off ball movement in college with the most important part being Trae's very fast release. Also, his passing traits are great which I think are just as important as his shooting at the next level. Even though comparing him to Stephen Curry is very bold, seeing what he has displayed, it is very hard not to compare him to Stephen Curry. Trae was just about as good as Curry in his junior year at Davidson as a freshman, even showing better passing skills than Stephen Curry in college. Trae certainly has his flaws but he has an offensive skill set that many players will never have no matter how hard they try. In a league more about spacing than ever, I believe Trae Young can shoot with the best of them. I also believe many people may miss out on Trae Young taking a positional need instead of someone that has the potential to be a once in a generation shooter.

","Why Trae Young is my Favorite Player in the 2018 NBA Draft. **Intro:**

Greetings, my name is Tyler. In this 2018 NBA draft, there are a lot of interesting prospects with many different skill sets and accomplishments. Luka Doncic is exhibiting himself as the best European prospect in history winning the EuroLeague championship, Euroleague MVP and the Final Four MVP. Mohamed Bamba has posted the longest wingspan in the history of the NBA combine. Combined with being second in the NCAA Division 1 in blocked shots per game and very solid mobility, he has the potential to be a dominant force at the NBA level. Uber-athletic double double machines Marvin Bagley and Deandre Ayton cannot be overlooked as both have athleticism that is rare in players 6'11 and taller. The mystery surrounding Michael Porter Jr with his back injury and how much that will affect him is interesting as well. He was an absolutely dominant force at the high school level. He led his team in high school to a perfect 29-0 record resulting in them winning the Washington Class 3A State Championship. Porter Jr averaged a monster 36.2 ppg and 13.6 rebounds a game.He was the number 1 player in the 2017 ESPN 100 class before Marvin Bagley reclassified. Jaren Jackson Jr. showed amazing potential in his limited minutes and touches at Michigan State. He established himself as a dominant shot blocker at the college level, and that skill looks very translatable to the NBA. He averaged 3 blocks in only 21.8 minutes of play, so his per-36-minute block rate is an absurd 4.95 blocks per 36 minutes. Combine that with a very solid 39% 3 point percentage in college, and he has the tools to be a great offensive and defensive front court player. Even with all the amazing potential of all the players in this draft, my favorite prospect in this draft is Trae Young and I am going to explain why that is.

**Passing:**

Trae Young has displayed masterful passing skills at Oklahoma combined with excellent court vision. On a subpar Oklahoma team that went 11-20 the year befor, Trae Young joined the team. With no other creators on the team Trae Young was under a lot of pressure to create for other teammates, set them up and put them in the best position to succeed while creating for himself. Trae Young averaged 8.7 assists to lead the nation in assists at points of the season with his assist total being higher than 9 per game. His turnover rate of 5.2 per a game jumps out and can cause concern. Turnovers are something that Trae has to work on at the next level. But if we compare it to other guards in this draft, his turnover rate is not as alarming as it seems. Using College Basketball Reference, I compared Trae Young's assist to turnover ratio to other top point guards. Collin Sexton averages 3.6 assist to 2.8 turnovers per a game which indicates that he has an assist to turnover ratio of 1.286 compared to Trae Young's ratio of 1.673. Even John Wall, a guard known notoriously for his passing skills posted a slightly lower assist to turnover ratio of 1.625, with far superior talent surrounding him. DeMarcus Cousins, Eric Bledsoe, and Patrick Patterson were all part of the 2009-2010 Kentucky Wildcat's team. All of them NBA players currently. Anybody on the Sooners basketball team that Trae Young played on would be lucky to be in the G league.

"With the recent news (or rumor) that the Bulls want to draft Chandler Hutchinson with the 22nd pick as a backup wing, who then earns the backup shooting guard position for next year?

His jumpshot was and still is mostly nonexistent, but he showed some ability to shoot corner threes over the course of the season. He rebounds almost as well as Denzel. He is 25 years old.

Denzel improved in all the major statistics from his rookie to sophomore season. He edges out Nwaba is most statistics except 2P%, but per 36 minutes they are mostly even on every stat. Denzel also showed crafty ability in the paint, consistently scoring with floaters. His growth this season was good to see with Hoiberg allowing him to play through his mistakes. He is 24 and has two years left on his deal. I prefer him over Nwaba because of a higher ceiling, his jump shot, and improvements in off-ball defense turning him into a good team defender.

"I think we have a lot of solid options at 22 that everyone may not be aware of, so I discussed them all here. I know some people may have different opinions than me, but I still think I have a lot of good info in here. Let me know what you think the best combinations of players we can come away with at 7 and 22 are

**Why pick Chandler Hutchison?**

I believe Chandler Hutchison will be the steal of the draft. If you’re not familiar with him, I’ll fill you in. He is a super athletic wing who played 4 years at Boise State. He’s 6’7 with a 7’1 wingspan, which is basically the same size as Mikal Bridges. He’s not the same kind of player though. He has the same tools, but Mikal is a better defender at this point. Mikal is an elite shooter, but Hutchison isn’t a sure thing on that end yet. He has made fantastic progress though, just like Mikal, in the past 3 years he’s had steady improvement

**Sophomore:** 23&#37; on .4 attempts per game from 3, 64&#37; FT shooter on 2.5 per game

**Junior:** 38&#37; on 2.2 attempts per game from 3, 67&#37; FT shooter on 5.5 per game

**Senior:** 36&#37; on 4.1 attempts per game from 3, 73&#37; FT shooter on 7.2 per game

It’s clear he’s been progressing as a shooter every single year, but did you also notice the rise in FT attempts? That’s another area he took major strides in, and that’s whats most intriguing about him as a player, his work ethic and his ability to improve

Here’s an article detailing how special and hard a worker he is ——\> [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nba.com/amp/league/article/2018/03/03/boise\-state\-chandler\-hutchison\-feature\-2018\-nba\-draft](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nba.com/amp/league/article/2018/03/03/boise-state-chandler-hutchison-feature-2018-nba-draft)

Here’s another ——\> [https://www.google.com/amp/amp.si.com/nba/2017/12/13/nba\-draft\-chandler\-hutchison\-boise\-state\-weber\-state\-damian\-lillard](https://www.google.com/amp/amp.si.com/nba/2017/12/13/nba-draft-chandler-hutchison-boise-state-weber-state-damian-lillard)

If you’re too lazy to read, I’ll give you some highlights. He works out with the same trainer who developed Damian Lillard and even Lillard raves about his improvements.

“He’s thriving playing roughly five fewer minutes a night, seemingly showcasing a new wrinkle each game. Beckner once left town for a week, leaving a graduate assistant to guide Hutchison in advanced ball handling work. “The next day he shows up, he’s already good at it,” Beckner said. “The kid’s a freak. He excels at a quicker rate and improves at a quicker rate than any other player I’ve worked with.”

“Yet his remodeling is undeniable, and he’s won over Lillard, the notorious gym rat, the All\-Star who chides college kids not even dressing for his alma mater to grind harder than him. “I think he’s even become a bigger Chandler fan, because he’s like, ‘Damn, Phil, he’s pretty good.’ Or, ‘He’s gotten better,’” Beckner said. “He saw Chandler two summers ago when that dude was skinny and just figuring it out and maybe didn’t want to work the whole time and now you just kind of see this.”

Where Hutchison is fantastic is in attacking the basket

From [https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2755370\-2018\-nba\-draft\-boise\-states\-chandler\-hutchison\-could\-be\-this\-years\-kyle\-kuzma.amp.html](https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2755370-2018-nba-draft-boise-states-chandler-hutchison-could-be-this-years-kyle-kuzma.amp.html)

“Along with his improved shooting, he continues to establish himself as one of the nation's better slashers. And at 6'7"" with impressive agility and the athleticism to soar above the rim, his attacking ability has stood out under the scouting lens. Difficult to stop when driving downhill, Hutchison also demonstrates advanced footwork off the dribble with stutter and Eurosteps to avoid and freeze defenders. He has terrific body control on the move when getting into his layups and finishes, which he can convert using either hand \(60.9 percent FG around the basket\).

Isolation drives to the basket left \(non\-jumpers\): 1.118 PPP, 88th percentile \(excellent\)

**Pick\-and\-roll drives to the basket:** 1.321 PPP, 87th percentile \(excellent\)

**Transition ball\-handler:** 1.088 PPP, 74th percentile \(very good\)

**Spot\-up drives to basket:** 1.179 PPP, 65th percentile \(very good\)

Hutchison has also been notably more efficient working out of isolation this season. On tape, it appears some of his improvement can be traced \(again\) to his footwork. He's using it to create separation, both off his first step and his last step before rising into his shot.

**2016\-17 Isolation:** .778 PPP, 40.6 percent FG \(average\)

**2017\-18 Isolation:** 1.00 PPP, 57.9 percent FG \(very good\)”

I think Hutchison is a perfect fit for us. Even if he never develops into a star, he has fantastic potential if he shoots 3s consistently, attacks closeouts, and plays good defense. He’s not Bridges on defense, but he is good on that end and has major switch\-ability due to his size and length. His work ethic is fantastic and I think he’ll do everything in his power to become a great player. Maybe an over optimistic comp, but I believe he can be a Paul George\- like player.

I’ll leave you with some highlights so you can what his game is like

44 points when his jumper was on —\> [https://youtu.be/temjJ3jaNGk](https://youtu.be/temjJ3jaNGk)

32 points doing more damage near the basket —\> [https://youtu.be/p5wzu9agI00](https://youtu.be/p5wzu9agI00)

**Why pick Khyri Thomas?**

I’ve been seeing his name a lot more around here and I’m happy about that, as he’s a guy that any team will be happy to have

As a player it’s pretty simple with him, a 6’3 guard with a 6’10 wingspan who’s a great shooter and elite defender.

He’s a proven shooter, over three years at Creighton he shot almost 41&#37; on 323 attempts

He’s a lockdown defender, Two time Big East defensive player of the year, they literally call him Khyrifense. Here’s a tweet showing how good he was against the big east top 10 scorers ——\> [https://mobile.twitter.com/JonNyatawa/status/962788403635990529](https://mobile.twitter.com/JonNyatawa/status/962788403635990529)

Here’s #Khyrifense part 2 —\> [https://youtu.be/exhk1JKQOk8](https://youtu.be/exhk1JKQOk8)

He hasn’t shown any shot creation really, but there is potential there. I already may have been over optimistic on Hutchison, but I’m gonna do it again anyway with Khyri.

Here are some strengths of his listed by The Ringer Draft Guide [http://nbadraft.theringer.com](http://nbadraft.theringer.com)

•	Knockdown spot\-up 3\-point shooter who shows flashes of dynamic play off screens and handoffs.

•	Ambidextrous at\-rim finisher who’s at his best when feeding off teammates on straight\-line drives, slashes, and cuts.

•	His quick first step, long strides, and steadily improving handle suggests there’s untapped shot\-creation potential.

•	Skilled post player who can facilitate from the block or beat up on smaller guards.

•	Puts velocity on passes, tends to make smart plays, and loves to throw long outlet passes.

I’ll also do one those mystery player comparison things

**Player A:** 15.6/4.9/2.7 on 41/35/81 on 6.6 attempts from 3

**Player B:** 15.1/4.4/2.8 on 54/41/79 on 4.6 attempts from 3

Pretty similar huh? Well I’ll reveal it now, player A is Donovan Mitchell, another 6’3 guard with 6’10 wingspan, his last year at Louisville, and player B is Khyri this past year. Mitchell is a tier above as an athlete, but Khyri is still a pretty good one, and he’s a better shooter and defender coming out than Mitchell. Now again I’m not saying he’ll be better or as good as Mitchell, but Mitchell was a surprise this year too, so I don’t think it’s \*impossible\*

Regardless of my blind optimism, Khyri will at least be a great 3 and D guard who will be able to guard 1s, 2s, and some 3s due to his length. If Zach makes no strides on defense, it would be pretty awesome to roll out Kris\-Khyri defensive lineups in 4th quarters. And even more intriguing is the potential future Kyrie\-Khyri matchups in the playoffs.

**Why pick Jalen Brunson**?

Jalen Brunson is from Illinois \(Played at Stevenson in Lincolnshire\) so having another hometown \(homestate I guess\) PG might be pretty cool. He also does have some pretty cool bulls connections already.

*the following story talks about his dad who’s been in the news for some negative stuff lately, but we’re just focusing on the player*

“In 2010, Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau hired Rick as an assistant, and the Brunsons moved to the northern suburbs of Chicago, a city that treats high school basketball like a pro sport. When Rick had a free hour after practice, he called Sandra to bring Jalen to the Berto Center to train alongside Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah.”

Also he may have pulled the most baller move of all time

“When he rocked a Michael Jordan jersey at a Wizards game, Jordan asked, “Would you like me to sign that?”“No,” Jalen replied, backing away. “You’ll mess it up.”

He’s not close to Rose in terms of excitement, but watching Brunson really gives off a Chris Paul/Steve Nash type vibe where you always feel like he’s in control and going to make the right play. He won two championships during his time at Villanova and won player of the year this past season. However, we all know great college players don’t always make great NBA players, So what’s the appeal?

First off, he’s a great shooter. Career 39&#37; shooter on 450 attempts, Career 82&#37; free throw shooter on 405 shots. He’s very strong for a PG and can post up other guards. He’s also just very skilled. As a smaller PG without great athleticism, he shot 60&#37; on 2 pointers, which is pretty impressive.

Here’s his strengths from The Stepien [https://www.thestepien.com/jalen\-brunson/](https://www.thestepien.com/jalen-brunson/)

•	Classic game\-manager under control point guard. Sense of the moment for when to get his own and when to set up his teammates. Does not force things. Currently sporting a stellar 3.89:1 A/TO ratio.

•	Smooth shooter off the catch or the dribble. Can punish defenses for sagging off in pick\-and\-roll.

•	Tight handle, good change of pace, and strong 200 pound frame allow him to get where he wants on the court.

•	Phenomenal footwork. Great at using jab steps on perimeter and using pivots and footwork in the lane to create space.

•	Uses strength and savvy to finish well around the basket. Goes into defenders bodies and draws contact. Even posts up occasionally.

•	Can body guys up on the defensive end. Fights through screens. Competes with solid feet.

Here’s his strengths from the Ringer Draft Guide [http://nbadraft.theringer.com/](http://nbadraft.theringer.com/)

•	Coaches can rely on him to steady the ship and avoid careless mistakes with his pristine feel for the game.

•	Unselfish passer who moves the ball.

•	Uses deception, change of pace, and advanced footwork, to create space to shoot or pass off the dribble, despite lacking elite agility.

•	Great shotmaker off the catch and screens, and can make defenders pay by sinking jumpers off the bounce.

•	Advanced post game could be useful for teams that invert their offense with guards playmaking inside and bigs spacing the floor.

•	Creative finisher around the rim.

•	Plays hard on defense and rebounds well for his position.

Here’s another interesting article comparing him to PGs like him who’ve found a place in the NBA like Fred Van Vleet, Yogi Ferrel, and TJ McConnell——\> [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/2018/4/2/17186882/jalen\-brunson\-fred\-vanvleet\-frank\-mason](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/2018/4/2/17186882/jalen-brunson-fred-vanvleet-frank-mason)

Basically, he’s a smart, skilled PG who has athletic limitations. I know Payne showed flashes last year, but I don’t feel too confident at this point moving forward with him and Grant as our backup PGs, so I think bringing in Brunson could be a good move as he can probably contribute off the bench right away, and we can see if his savviness translates into anything more.

**Why pick Bruce Brown?**

Bruce Brown is a 6’4 guard with a 6’8 wingspan from Miami. He’s a fantastic athlete and he has a relentless motor draft Express likened to Russel Westbrook \([http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Bruce\-Brown\-71658/](http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Bruce-Brown-71658/)\)

He’s kind of a jack\-of\-all\-trades type of player at this point. He’s tenacious on D \(see what I did there\) and can switch due to his athleticism and length, and he’s a good passer and rebounder

His line this past year: 11.4/7.1/4.0 with 1.3 steals and almost 1 block a game.

At this point he can’t shoot and he’s pretty raw scoring wise. If you’re thinking it might be a little redundant to have him and Nwaba, you may be right. Taking him would be a gamble on his elite athletic potential and relentless mentality. Fred has shown he can double as a shooting coach, so maybe he can help Brown take a leap there.

**Why pick Aaron Holiday?**

Aaron Holiday is Justin and Jrue’s brother so if you had to guess, you’d probably think he’s good at basketball. Well he is. I actually think he may be underrated as a prospect due to his brothers, some people seem to insinuate he’s only being considered because he’s related to them. Well, he’s not and \*BOLD PREDICTION ALERT\* he will end up a better player than Justin, you can @ me.

Aaron Holiday is a 6’1 PG who had a pretty prolific junior year. He averaged 20/3.7/6 on 46/43/83 \(6 attempts from 3\) and was a career 42&#37; shooter on 427 shots. Might sound similar to Brunson, but he’s not as physically limited. He has a 6’6 wingspan that helps him on the defensive end where he’s been very pesky but inconsistent. He has more shot diversity and is far quicker and more explosive. He can playmake, finish with either hand, and has a floater game. He operates the pick and roll very well too.

His scouting reports are glowing and his flaws all appear to be fixable with coaching

——\> [http://nbadraft.theringer.com/——\>](http://nbadraft.theringer.com/——>) [https://www.thestepien.com/aaron\-holiday/](https://www.thestepien.com/aaron-holiday/)

Aaron Holiday is just a really good player and I think would be an instant upgrade to our bench. If we draft a wing and Justin is pushed to our bench, they may have some built in chemistry too. He has 2 way starting PG upside too, and I think would be a fantastic add at 22. A Holiday\-Holiday\-Valentine\-Portis led bench sounds pretty intriguing.

**Why pick Shamorie Ponds?**

Don’t you miss the days of watching Derrick Rose? The explosiveness! The speed! The strength! The size! Stacy always said Too big, too strong, too fast! Would you like another point guard like that? Well Ponds can’t help you there. He’s not even close to the level of athlete Rose was, BUT he is similar in one area: Creativity in finishing. There are guys like Westbrook and Lebron who are fantastic at getting to the basket, but don’t utilize much creativity or finesse when they’re there. There’s a lot of guys like James Harden who don’t even try to score when they drive, they just hope for contact. Then there’s a dying breed, namely Derrick Rose still, Kyrie, and Steph Curry. Guys who actually try and finish around defenders with acrobatic moves and creativity. Well if you’re like me and you love layups more than dunks, you’ll like Ponds

Just watch what he did to Duke earlier this year —\> [https://youtu.be/JCz8anK\-AEc](https://youtu.be/JCz8anK-AEc)

Ponds is very quick, and you can see he utilizes a lot floaters and wrong foot layups to keep defenders off balance along with his creativity at the rim. He’s more akin to a Kemba like player than Rose, but you can see some flashes in that clip. His numbers weren’t fantastic, but much like Trae Young it’s a product of the situation he’s in and some bad decision making. He may have some two way potential also.

Here’s the article that made me fall in love with Ponds, they can give you a way more accurate picture of his game —\> [https://94feetreport.com/draft\-profile\-shamorie\-ponds\-a3c55839a779](https://94feetreport.com/draft-profile-shamorie-ponds-a3c55839a779)

If he comes out, which is a big If at this point, I believe he’ll be the 2nd best PG in the draft and a potential steal at 22. However his stock is very low right now and if he doesn’t think he’ll go in the 1st I don’t believe he’ll come out this year.

**Why pick Jontay Porter?**

He’s really just a smart basketball player. He’s really good at putting himself in the right spots on offense and defense, he makes the right plays, and has a lot of potential as a ball handler and shooter. He’s slightly turnover prone at this point because he tries to do a little too much and he needs a ton of work on his body in order to be an NBA athlete. Taking him would be the complete opposite of a typical gamble. You take him for his skill set and hope he can add athleticism along the way. He had the highest body fat &#37; at the combine so its clear he can improve his body a lot.

If you're a fan of Wendell Carter as a prospect, I think you'll be a fan on Jontay Porter also. Here's some somewhat cherry picked similarities in their scouting

*Some of Wendell’s strengths as listed by the Stepien*

•	Outside shot looks very promising. Shooting 48.6&#37; from three on 37 attempts so far, and 72.5&#37; from the stripe. Smooth and confident shot in mid\-range areas.

•	Plus feel for the game. Has a 1:1 A/TO ratio, shown the ability to pass on the move and in the high post. Projects well to “short\-roll” situations as a decision maker.

•	Good handle for a big guy. Has shown flashes of attacking closeouts and taking big guys who press up on him off the dribble. Could develop an off\-the\-dribble shot.

•	Pretty good awareness defensively. Disciplined about rotating to the rim and challenging shots. Makes up for his relatively slow feet with smart positioning.

•	Does the little things on offense well. Good screener for a young big guy, knows how to play high low, seals his man when guard penetrates his way. Handle and smarts will allow him to function in dribble handoff sets.

*Some of Jontay’s strengths as listed by the Stepien*

•	High\-level shooter for a big man. Has a quick and compact release, and is comfortable shooting in pick\-and\-pop or spot\-up situations. Shooting 37.7&#37; from three on an encouraging 8.1 3PA/40 and 76.5&#37; at the line. Projects to be a true shooting 5 in the NBA.

•	Elite court vision and passing. Great at kicking out of doubles in the post, decisive and smart in the way he swings the ball around the perimeter. Will be a dynamic passer in “short\-roll” situations in the NBA.

•	Fantastic handle for a big guy. Comfortable attacking closeouts and putting the ball on the deck in transition. His shooting, passing, and dribbling combination make him a difficult guard in pick\-and\-pop situations.

•	Extremely smart help defender. Always in the right position making backline rotations. Gets a lot of “point\-of\-release” blocks because he is in the right place.

•	Gets himself involved in the action offensively. A good screen setter with a good sense of angles and is always looking to find someone to screen, or advance the offense in some way.

Here’s full scouting reports if you wanna read more about him —\> [https://www.thestepien.com/jontay\-porter/—\>](https://www.thestepien.com/jontay-porter/—>) [http://nbadraft.theringer.com/](http://nbadraft.theringer.com/)

Here’s someone who broke down his fit with the lakers, but it’s still full of a lot of good info that can apply to us —\> [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.silverscreenandroll.com/platform/amp/2018/5/15/17329644/la\-lakers\-draft\-profile\-missouri\-jontay\-porter](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.silverscreenandroll.com/platform/amp/2018/5/15/17329644/la-lakers-draft-profile-missouri-jontay-porter)

Ideally, he’d be a guy who can protect the rim, hold up on switches, and stretch the floor. My dream would also be for him to become a good enough ball handler to where he runs PnR with Lauri. He’s just a really skilled player and seems to be a good teammate and with development he may end up being the center we need.

**Why pick Melvin Frazier?**

He is the best defender in this draft. He is 6’5 with a monster 7’2 wingspan and crazy athleticism. Luckily, Draft Express \(the best scouting website before they were bought by ESPN, put behind a paywall, and relegated to writing articles with far less detail than usual\) was still able to put out videos on what type of player Frazier is on offense and defense

Melvin Frazier Offense ——\> [https://youtu.be/uBje1tZTWUs](https://youtu.be/uBje1tZTWUs)

Melvin Frazier defense ——\> [https://youtu.be/McCVdpx1DFI](https://youtu.be/McCVdpx1DFI)

His shot is not a sure bet yet, but his defensive capabilities are undeniable and having him to throw at our future competition would be extremely valuable, and he still has a lot of room to grow on offense.

**Why pick Mitchell Robinson?**

You’re feeling pretty lucky that’s why. You’ll need to be because we have no idea whether he’ll be a great player or a complete bust, and that’s what comes with guys you haven’t seen in college. Overall, he’s a super athletic center who blocks shots, rebounds, and from what he’s said has a jump shot. Here are some of his high school scouting notes from draft Express.

**Strengths**

⁃	Great combination of height, length, reach and athleticism for a center prospect. Measured 7'0 in shoes, with a 7'3 ½ wingspan and a 9'2 standing reach.

⁃	Not bulky or strong right now, but has wide shoulders that look like they can add weight over time. Lower body isn't bad either

⁃	Moves extremely well. Fluid. Terrific rim\-runner. Quick off his feet. Pogo stick type leaper. Gets up for lob finishes with ease. Great potential as a finisher off two feet. Covers ground exceptionally well

⁃	Very good hands, Has a budding skill\-level that can be harnessed into something productive over time. Shooting stroke looks decent. Ball comes out of hand cleanly with nice rotation. Throws in mid\-range and turnaround jumpers. Shows flashes of finishing with both hands.

⁃	Has a bit of a handle and some footwork. Doesn't really know what he's doing but has some skill

⁃	Averaged 20 rebounds per\-40 minutes in the EYBL, best in the competition's history. 8 offensive rebounds per\-40 also #1 in EYBL history.

⁃	Quick off his feet as a shot blocker. Led the EYBL in both blocks per\-game and per\-40. Second best shot\-blocker in EYBL history after Nerlens Noel.

⁃	Length and ability to cover ground gives him tremendous potential as a pick and roll defender

⁃	Average feel isn't that much of a detriment considering his expected role. Doesn't overthink things. Just goes out and makes plays

**Weaknesses**

⁃	Has high hips and a bit of an awkward frame. Has a ways to go to maximize his frame

⁃	Skill\-level is a work in progress in five on five settings. Shows flashes in practice but is a ways away from translating that to game competition.

⁃	Doesn't really know how to play. Awareness, fundamentals, IQ all have a long ways to go.

⁃	Gets lost off the ball defensively. Gives up deep post position without resistance. Gets overpowered by stronger players on a regular basis.

⁃	Foul prone. Will likely have some trouble staying on the court early on until he learns how to play without fouling

⁃	Gets rebounds off his tools, doesn't really box out.

⁃	Doesn't always appear to have the most serious approach. Laid\-back demeanor

⁃	A year old for his class  

So he’s really boom or bust. Best rebounder in EYBL history? Sounds pretty great. But he didn’t really box out and got it off his tools? Yikes. Doesn’t over think things, just goes out and makes plays? Cool. Doesn’t know how to play, IQ, awareness, and fundamentals all have a long way to go? Not so cool.

Here’s a hard guy to figure out. If you watch an interview with him, you’ll notice he pretty much gives one word answers and as short a reply as possible. This interview in particular is odd —\> [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9G0JrtkWreIHe](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9G0JrtkWreIHe) answers succinctly, but sometimes it appears he doesn’t even understand the question. Then there was the whole debacle on why he didn’t play college basketball, which you can read more about here —\> [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/college\-basketball/2017/8/2/16083402/mitchell\-robinson\-western\-kentucky\-transfer\-nba\-draftOne](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/college-basketball/2017/8/2/16083402/mitchell-robinson-western-kentucky-transfer-nba-draftOne) day he was at Western Kentucky and practicing, and he just decided pack up all his stuff and go home without telling anyone. They didn’t know until he didn’t show up for practice, and after checking his dorm they found it empty.

So is he just kind of dumb? I don’t know, because in the interview he stated he started playing basketball because he realized it was the only way he would get to college, and that he liked math and science. He also expresses his interest in computer science, which he does again at the end of this interview —\> [https://youtu.be/FRcA4QLyGUQ](https://youtu.be/FRcA4QLyGUQ) he’s still so young, he could be a smart kid who’s just awkward and doesn’t really know how to handle social situations, like interviews or letting his coaches know he’s headed home, but I can’t really be sure.

So overall, if you believe in his potential and that we can develop him into a great player, he would the perfect two way compliment to Lauri in our front court. he could also be another Javale McGee where he never quite plays up to his tools.

**Why pick Bruno Fernando?**

Bruno Fernando is another project, although probably a safer one because we’ve seen him in college. He is a 6’10 center with a 7’4 wingspan, and crazy athleticism. He covers a ton of ground on the floor, has great defensive range, and has an NBA ready body. He also has a really dope name.

Here’s one play that displays his athleticism—\> [https://youtu.be/\-eZqcBYPOtAHere’s](https://youtu.be/-eZqcBYPOtAHere’s) another —\> [https://youtu.be/odhuwWMahHc](https://youtu.be/odhuwWMahHc)

Here’s some shortened tape if you’d like to see how he is in a game Vs Michigan State —\> [https://youtu.be/mPeUY\-4W8MAVs](https://youtu.be/mPeUY-4W8MAVs) Nebraska —\> [https://youtu.be/anZ7dIkfjH4](https://youtu.be/anZ7dIkfjH4)

Fernando’s ceiling is a guy who can be a dominant presence protecting the rim and out guarding on the perimeter, as well as a rim runner on offense. He has showed flashes of touch around the post too, and his jump shot mechanics are pretty solid. He shot 74&#37; from the free throw line in college and there’s video \( [https://mobile.twitter.com/draftexpress/status/996966869633503232](https://mobile.twitter.com/draftexpress/status/996966869633503232) \)of him knocking down open jumpers at the combine, so he may have some shooting touch.

As I’ve said before, all we really need is a big man who can protect the rim, hold up on switches, and knockdown jumpers \(this part is more of a luxury but would be awesome\) and Fernando has serious potential to be that type of player.

**Why pick Keita Bates Diop?**

Keita Bates Diop, or KBD as I have affectionately never called him, is a 6’8 forward with a giant 7’3 wingspan. He’s a 3 and D wing with some scoring upside, although he’ll likely just be a shooter who can take advantage of mismatches in the post. He also moves well off ball and is a good cutter.

This past year he won Big Ten POY and averaged 20/8.7/1.6 on 48/36/79 with about 5 attempts from 3 per game.

His defensive versatility is his main selling point, and he’ll likely be able to play either forward spot, and maybe some small ball center on rare occasion. If you wanna read more in depth about it, here’s a good discussion about his defensive abilities ——\> [https://94feetreport.com/keita\-bates\-diop\-the\-next\-prototype\-8768092b870a](https://94feetreport.com/keita-bates-diop-the-next-prototype-8768092b870a)

I think he would be a nice solid pick, someone we can slot in at the 3 who can play good defense and stretch the floor, the only concern to have when picking him is that he may be at his best as a 4 in the NBA. If the bulls believe that, they should pass on him in favor of one of the other 3 and D guys, but if they’re confident he’ll be a SF then he’d be a great fit for us.

**Why pick Afernee Simons?**

I’m sure everyone here has already heard about Simons, but he’s a combo guard who could potentially come out of high school straight into the NBA. Simons is a great athlete with 3 level scoring potential and defensive potential due to his length. So what’s not to like? Well mostly the fact that he’s a high schooler with a high school body. Strength and physical development will be a big issue for a guy who already had trouble dealing with physicality and contact in high school, and he’s still figuring which guard position suits him best. If we draft Simons, he probably won’t be able to contribute for a few years

Good article on him and his strengths \+ weaknesses —\> [https://www.thestepien.com/2018/03/16/anfernee\-simons\-wrong\-initiator/](https://www.thestepien.com/2018/03/16/anfernee-simons-wrong-initiator/)

Good video breakdown —\> [https://youtu.be/9xAzcz4f08E](https://youtu.be/9xAzcz4f08E)

Simons, much like Robinson, is a total gamble. He could be the steal of the draft, maybe if we saw him in college he would be in the convo for #1 next year? Or maybe if we saw him in college he would have been completely exposed? There’s no way to know.

We do have the 7th pick, so even though we’re a rebuilding team, the 22nd can be treated at somewhat of a luxury. It would bolster our team for whoever we choose to work out, but it’s not going to derail us if they don’t. If the FO are confident they can develop him, his potential is worthy of investing in.

**Why pick Elie Okobo?**

I don’t think there’s been much, if any, talk about Okobo on this sub. I don’t think many people have even heard of him at this point, so I’ll introduce you. Elie Okobo is a 20 year old French guard and probably the second best European prospect in the draft.

Here’s a little blurb from ESPN that sums up his game

“Okobo has attracted significant attention this season from NBA scouts, not just due to his productivity but also his size, 6\-8 wingspan and scoring instincts. He's a fluid athlete who plays above the rim regularly, changes speeds smoothly in the open floor, is a prolific pick\-and\-roll player who can find the open man and has proven to be a capable shot\-maker, pulling up off the dribble from long vantage points.”

The ringer draft guide lists his strengths as:

•	Impressive shooter off the dribble. He uses step\-backs, pull\-ups, and sidesteps to get his shot off. It’s like he’s mimicking James Harden.

•	Good spot\-up shooter who has potential to hit shots off screens if he focuses on mastering his footwork.

•	Active off\-ball cutter. He grew up playing two\-guard, and it shows with his movement relocating, running through screens, and cutting.

•	Skilled at\-rim finisher who has touch, uses either hand, and can make difficult wrong\-footed layups against length and athleticism.

•	He’s a fairly explosive leaper in the open floor. He’ll sometimes surprise you with big dunks driving in traffic.

•	Improved ball handler who changes speeds, uses spin moves and Eurosteps, and shows good feel and pace in the pick\-and\-roll.

•	Solid passer who makes basic reads and has progressed at advanced ones like cross\-court kickouts.

•	Flashes good defensive potential when he’s engaged. He has long arms and the quickness to contain dribble penetration.

He’s a similar player to Afernee Simons, although I would say he’s better at this point because he plays in a professional league. He’s also still in the process of figuring out what guard position he’ll end up at, he’s trying to be a point guard but he still needs to shore up some areas of his game.

Okobo has a ton of potential, an intriguing skill set, and a great physical profile. If GarPax are considering drafting the highest upside player at 22, I think Okobo should be ahead of Simons and Robinson. He has as much potential as them, and will likely be able to contribute earlier than them.

If you’d like to read more in depth about him, here’s a really great article —\> [https://www.thestepien.com/2018/02/15/hiding\-plain\-sight\-elie\-okobo/](https://www.thestepien.com/2018/02/15/hiding-plain-sight-elie-okobo/)

**Why pick Jacob Evans?**

Jacob is a nice 3 and D wing who should have a solid career and could fit right in nicely at SF. He’s a pretty solid shooter at 38&#37; on 462 attempts and 76&#37; career FT shooter. He’s a solid defender too. He’s about 6’6 with a 6’9 wingspan, solid size to go with solid athleticism. Key word: solid. Nothing about him really jumps off the page, he’s just a good player. He’s not a lockdown 1 v 1 defender, but within a team concept he’s very good at rotations and communicating, and he’s effective at switching

Here’s a good article detailing this strength —\> [https://www.thestepien.com/2018/03/09/biggest\-evaluation\-inefficiency\-draft\-team\-defense/](https://www.thestepien.com/2018/03/09/biggest-evaluation-inefficiency-draft-team-defense/)

He’s really comfortable in embracing his role and seems to be a smart player all around, here’s an interview where he shows some of that —\> [https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/video/jacob\-evans\-i\-can\-fit\-any\-offense](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/video/jacob-evans-i-can-fit-any-offense)

He can fill a need for us right away and even if we pick him over some higher upside guys, I don’t think we’d regret it looking back in a few years

**Why pick Josh Okogie?**

Josh Okogie would be a pick in the same vein as Bruce Brown, except he can shoot. He’s more of a scorer though than a do it all type guy. He’s 6’4 with a massive 7 foot wingspan which gives him a lot of defensive versatility

Here’s his strengths and weaknesses from the Ringer draft guide:

**Strengths**

•	Has the versatility to switch onto multiple positions given his excellent length, muscular frame, and great agility.

•	Strong help defender who hustles, stays engaged, invades passing lanes, and blocks shots from the weak side.

•	Plus rebounder for his position.

•	Good shooting potential if he raises his release point and speeds up his gather; as is, his shot is susceptible to closeouts by NBA athletes.

•	Has shown the ability to score off the bounce with one\-dribble pull\-ups or step\-backs; if those fall in the NBA, driving lanes will open.

•	Intelligent off\-ball cutter; he’ll be at his best in a non\-feature role.

**Weaknesses**•	Low shooting release.

•	Needs to get better at finishing tough below\-the\-rim layups; he drew a lot of fouls in college, but may not get the benefit of the whistle in the NBA.

•	Average passer.

•	Lacks an advanced handle and doesn’t change directions with the agility necessary to run pick\-and\-roll at a high level.

Another scouting report —\> [https://www.thestepien.com/josh\-okogie/](https://www.thestepien.com/josh-okogie/)

Overall, Okogie is a good, strong athlete with great tools and a lot scoring potential. He needs to refine pretty much his entire offensive game, but he has a lot of potential to be a very effective two way player that will be useful off our bench and can play alongside Dunn when we need to lock down.

**Why not pick Dzanan Musa?** He’s one of the most popular names that comes up when discussing who to take at 22. I think taking him would be a mistake for a few reasons.

The first is that his overall skill set doesn’t warrant a 1st round selection in my eyes. He doesn’t have any NBA ready traits outside of his shooting. He’s not that great of a shooter either, he can make big shots, but his overall shot selection is terrible. Due to that, he’s a lifetime 31&#37; shooter on 558 attempts.

Maybe his efficiency goes up as he adapts to more of role player role, but that’s my 2nd concern. I don’t believe he’ll ever settle into just being a role player. He is really reckless on the court and is just a straight gunner, there’s a lot of Mirotic in his game where he pulls up randomly from way beyond the arc for no reason, he feels he has a green light at all times. Dunn and Lavine already have somewhat of a power struggle going on, throwing another alpha dog with even less talent than them into the mix will only make things worse.

The third reason I don’t wanna draft him is because of his defense. He is tall enough for SF but he’ll probably end up at SG. He doesn’t have the strength to handle wing players, and he really doesn’t have the lateral quickness to handle anyone on defense. He plays hunched over and I think it hurts his defensive abilities.

Overall, I think he’ll be an inefficient chucker who plays bad defense and doesn’t fill a need for us. I would steer clear of him.

Here’s a breakdown video on him if you wanna see what his game is like, draft Express and others do have far higher opinions of him than I do —\> [https://youtu.be/\-uMBgJ5mLQs](https://youtu.be/-uMBgJ5mLQs)

**Why not pick Grayson Allen?** Grayson Allen is a pretty good athlete and shooter. He’s not a good defender. He’s also a dirty player who’s been too scared to come into the NBA despite having a chance to be drafted every year he’s played in college, and he throws tantrums when things don’t go his way. No thanks.

[https://youtu.be/tcEq7xhxD4g](https://youtu.be/tcEq7xhxD4g)

**Why not pick Kevin Huerter?**

Kevin Huerter is a 6’7 SG who’s a great shooter with average length. I wasn’t sure whether to include him or not in this, but his stock has been rising and he’s been talked about more so I figured I’d throw him in. He is a great shooter and one of the best, most pure ones in the draft and I think he has a chance to be a solid Korver/Redick type player, I just don’t think he’s good enough to pick at 22 or that he fills a need for us. I’ve named other guys who could be 2 guards, but they all have defensive capabilities which can help compensate for Zach’s troubles on that end when we need to sub him out. Huerter can’t fill that need, and ultimately I think we have a lot of better options. Here’s a breakdown of what type of player he is from the Ringer draft guide if you wanna know more about him

**Strengths**•	Excellent spot\-up shooter with deep range. No one in the draft is better at hitting off\-balance jumpers off screens.

•	Comfortable hitting one\-two dribble pull\-ups or step\-backs from deep.

•	He quickly attacks closeouts rather than holding the ball, is aggressive on straight\-line drives, and finishes with either hand inside.

•	Solid passer either off the dribble or when facilitating on the perimeter. He displays a high basketball IQ.

•	Plays hard on defense with good length, instincts, and focus. He’s not afraid to contest a shot even if it means being posterized.

**Weaknesses**

•	Needs to quicken his shooting form. He brings the ball far out away from his body, which gives defenders an extra beat to contest his release.

•	Lean frame and lack of quickness could make him a defensive liability unless he gets a lot stronger and develops better fundamentals.

•	Takes too many risks as a passer by throwing the ball into traffic.","Making the case for our options at 22 (Long post) I think we have a lot of solid options at 22 that everyone may not be aware of, so I discussed them all here. I know some people may have different opinions than me, but I still think I have a lot of good info in here. Let me know what you think the best combinations of players we can come away with at 7 and 22 are

**Why pick Chandler Hutchison?**

I believe Chandler Hutchison will be the steal of the draft. If you’re not familiar with him, I’ll fill you in. He is a super athletic wing who played 4 years at Boise State. He’s 6’7 with a 7’1 wingspan, which is basically the same size as Mikal Bridges. He’s not the same kind of player though. He has the same tools, but Mikal is a better defender at this point. Mikal is an elite shooter, but Hutchison isn’t a sure thing on that end yet. He has made fantastic progress though, just like Mikal, in the past 3 years he’s had steady improvement

**Sophomore:** 23&#37; on .4 attempts per game from 3, 64&#37; FT shooter on 2.5 per game

**Junior:** 38&#37; on 2.2 attempts per game from 3, 67&#37; FT shooter on 5.5 per game

**Senior:** 36&#37; on 4.1 attempts per game from 3, 73&#37; FT shooter on 7.2 per game

It’s clear he’s been progressing as a shooter every single year, but did you also notice the rise in FT attempts? That’s another area he took major strides in, and that’s whats most intriguing about him as a player, his work ethic and his ability to improve

Here’s an article detailing how special and hard a worker he is ——\> [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nba.com/amp/league/article/2018/03/03/boise\-state\-chandler\-hutchison\-feature\-2018\-nba\-draft](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nba.com/amp/league/article/2018/03/03/boise-state-chandler-hutchison-feature-2018-nba-draft)

Here’s another ——\> [https://www.google.com/amp/amp.si.com/nba/2017/12/13/nba\-draft\-chandler\-hutchison\-boise\-state\-weber\-state\-damian\-lillard](https://www.google.com/amp/amp.si.com/nba/2017/12/13/nba-draft-chandler-hutchison-boise-state-weber-state-damian-lillard)

If you’re too lazy to read, I’ll give you some highlights. He works out with the same trainer who developed Damian Lillard and even Lillard raves about his improvements.

“He’s thriving playing roughly five fewer minutes a night, seemingly showcasing a new wrinkle each game. Beckner once left town for a week, leaving a graduate assistant to guide Hutchison in advanced ball handling work. “The next day he shows up, he’s already good at it,” Beckner said. “The kid’s a freak. He excels at a quicker rate and improves at a quicker rate than any other player I’ve worked with.”

“Yet his remodeling is undeniable, and he’s won over Lillard, the notorious gym rat, the All\-Star who chides college kids not even dressing for his alma mater to grind harder than him. “I think he’s even become a bigger Chandler fan, because he’s like, ‘Damn, Phil, he’s pretty good.’ Or, ‘He’s gotten better,’” Beckner said. “He saw Chandler two summers ago when that dude was skinny and just figuring it out and maybe didn’t want to work the whole time and now you just kind of see this.”

Where Hutchison is fantastic is in attacking the basket

From [https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2755370\-2018\-nba\-draft\-boise\-states\-chandler\-hutchison\-could\-be\-this\-years\-kyle\-kuzma.amp.html](https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2755370-2018-nba-draft-boise-states-chandler-hutchison-could-be-this-years-kyle-kuzma.amp.html)

“Along with his improved shooting, he continues to establish himself as one of the nation's better slashers. And at 6'7"" with impressive agility and the athleticism to soar above the rim, his attacking ability has stood out under the scouting lens. Difficult to stop when driving downhill, Hutchison also demonstrates advanced footwork off the dribble with stutter and Eurosteps to avoid and freeze defenders. He has terrific body control on the move when getting into his layups and finishes, which he can convert using either hand \(60.9 percent FG around the basket\).

Isolation drives to the basket left \(non\-jumpers\): 1.118 PPP, 88th percentile \(excellent\)

**Pick\-and\-roll drives to the basket:** 1.321 PPP, 87th percentile \(excellent\)

**Transition ball\-handler:** 1.088 PPP, 74th percentile \(very good\)

**Spot\-up drives to basket:** 1.179 PPP, 65th percentile \(very good\)

Hutchison has also been notably more efficient working out of isolation this season. On tape, it appears some of his improvement can be traced \(again\) to his footwork. He's using it to create separation, both off his first step and his last step before rising into his shot.

**2016\-17 Isolation:** .778 PPP, 40.6 percent FG \(average\)

**2017\-18 Isolation:** 1.00 PPP, 57.9 percent FG \(very good\)”

I think Hutchison is a perfect fit for us. Even if he never develops into a star, he has fantastic potential if he shoots 3s consistently, attacks closeouts, and plays good defense. He’s not Bridges on defense, but he is good on that end and has major switch\-ability due to his size and length. His work ethic is fantastic and I think he’ll do everything in his power to become a great player. Maybe an over optimistic comp, but I believe he can be a Paul George\- like player.

I’ll leave you with some highlights so you can what his game is like

44 points when his jumper was on —\> [https://youtu.be/temjJ3jaNGk](https://youtu.be/temjJ3jaNGk)

32 points doing more damage near the basket —\> [https://youtu.be/p5wzu9agI00](https://youtu.be/p5wzu9agI00)

**Why pick Khyri Thomas?**

I’ve been seeing his name a lot more around here and I’m happy about that, as he’s a guy that any team will be happy to have

As a player it’s pretty simple with him, a 6’3 guard with a 6’10 wingspan who’s a great shooter and elite defender.

He’s a proven shooter, over three years at Creighton he shot almost 41&#37; on 323 attempts

He’s a lockdown defender, Two time Big East defensive player of the year, they literally call him Khyrifense. Here’s a tweet showing how good he was against the big east top 10 scorers ——\> [https://mobile.twitter.com/JonNyatawa/status/962788403635990529](https://mobile.twitter.com/JonNyatawa/status/962788403635990529)

Here’s a fanmade defensive mixtape, #Khyrifense —\> [https://youtu.be/L51xuwgcc\-k](https://youtu.be/L51xuwgcc-k)

Here’s #Khyrifense part 2 —\> [https://youtu.be/exhk1JKQOk8](https://youtu.be/exhk1JKQOk8)

He hasn’t shown any shot creation really, but there is potential there. I already may have been over optimistic on Hutchison, but I’m gonna do it again anyway with Khyri.

Here are some strengths of his listed by The Ringer Draft Guide [http://nbadraft.theringer.com](http://nbadraft.theringer.com)

•	Knockdown spot\-up 3\-point shooter who shows flashes of dynamic play off screens and handoffs.

•	Ambidextrous at\-rim finisher who’s at his best when feeding off teammates on straight\-line drives, slashes, and cuts.

•	His quick first step, long strides, and steadily improving handle suggests there’s untapped shot\-creation potential.

•	Skilled post player who can facilitate from the block or beat up on smaller guards.

•	Puts velocity on passes, tends to make smart plays, and loves to throw long outlet passes.

I’ll also do one those mystery player comparison things

**Player A:** 15.6/4.9/2.7 on 41/35/81 on 6.6 attempts from 3

**Player B:** 15.1/4.4/2.8 on 54/41/79 on 4.6 attempts from 3

Pretty similar huh? Well I’ll reveal it now, player A is Donovan Mitchell, another 6’3 guard with 6’10 wingspan, his last year at Louisville, and player B is Khyri this past year. Mitchell is a tier above as an athlete, but Khyri is still a pretty good one, and he’s a better shooter and defender coming out than Mitchell. Now again I’m not saying he’ll be better or as good as Mitchell, but Mitchell was a surprise this year too, so I don’t think it’s \*impossible\*

Regardless of my blind optimism, Khyri will at least be a great 3 and D guard who will be able to guard 1s, 2s, and some 3s due to his length. If Zach makes no strides on defense, it would be pretty awesome to roll out Kris\-Khyri defensive lineups in 4th quarters. And even more intriguing is the potential future Kyrie\-Khyri matchups in the playoffs.

**Why pick Jalen Brunson**?

Jalen Brunson is from Illinois \(Played at Stevenson in Lincolnshire\) so having another hometown \(homestate I guess\) PG might be pretty cool. He also does have some pretty cool bulls connections already.

*the following story talks about his dad who’s been in the news for some negative stuff lately, but we’re just focusing on the player*

“In 2010, Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau hired Rick as an assistant, and the Brunsons moved to the northern suburbs of Chicago, a city that treats high school basketball like a pro sport. When Rick had a free hour after practice, he called Sandra to bring Jalen to the Berto Center to train alongside Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah.”

Also he may have pulled the most baller move of all time

“When he rocked a Michael Jordan jersey at a Wizards game, Jordan asked, “Would you like me to sign that?”“No,” Jalen replied, backing away. “You’ll mess it up.”

He’s not close to Rose in terms of excitement, but watching Brunson really gives off a Chris Paul/Steve Nash type vibe where you always feel like he’s in control and going to make the right play. He won two championships during his time at Villanova and won player of the year this past season. However, we all know great college players don’t always make great NBA players, So what’s the appeal?

First off, he’s a great shooter. Career 39&#37; shooter on 450 attempts, Career 82&#37; free throw shooter on 405 shots. He’s very strong for a PG and can post up other guards. He’s also just very skilled. As a smaller PG without great athleticism, he shot 60&#37; on 2 pointers, which is pretty impressive.

Here’s his strengths from The Stepien [https://www.thestepien.com/jalen\-brunson/](https://www.thestepien.com/jalen-brunson/)

•	Classic game\-manager under control point guard. Sense of the moment for when to get his own and when to set up his teammates. Does not force things. Currently sporting a stellar 3.89:1 A/TO ratio.

•	Smooth shooter off the catch or the dribble. Can punish defenses for sagging off in pick\-and\-roll.

•	Tight handle, good change of pace, and strong 200 pound frame allow him to get where he wants on the court.

•	Phenomenal footwork. Great at using jab steps on perimeter and using pivots and footwork in the lane to create space.

•	Uses strength and savvy to finish well around the basket. Goes into defenders bodies and draws contact. Even posts up occasionally.

•	Can body guys up on the defensive end. Fights through screens. Competes with solid feet.

Here’s his strengths from the Ringer Draft Guide [http://nbadraft.theringer.com/](http://nbadraft.theringer.com/)

•	Coaches can rely on him to steady the ship and avoid careless mistakes with his pristine feel for the game.

•	Unselfish passer who moves the ball.

•	Uses deception, change of pace, and advanced footwork, to create space to shoot or pass off the dribble, despite lacking elite agility.

•	Great shotmaker off the catch and screens, and can make defenders pay by sinking jumpers off the bounce.

•	Advanced post game could be useful for teams that invert their offense with guards playmaking inside and bigs spacing the floor.

•	Creative finisher around the rim.

•	Plays hard on defense and rebounds well for his position.

Here’s another interesting article comparing him to PGs like him who’ve found a place in the NBA like Fred Van Vleet, Yogi Ferrel, and TJ McConnell——\> [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/2018/4/2/17186882/jalen\-brunson\-fred\-vanvleet\-frank\-mason](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/2018/4/2/17186882/jalen-brunson-fred-vanvleet-frank-mason)

Basically, he’s a smart, skilled PG who has athletic limitations. I know Payne showed flashes last year, but I don’t feel too confident at this point moving forward with him and Grant as our backup PGs, so I think bringing in Brunson could be a good move as he can probably contribute off the bench right away, and we can see if his savviness translates into anything more.

**Why pick Bruce Brown?**

Bruce Brown is a 6’4 guard with a 6’8 wingspan from Miami. He’s a fantastic athlete and he has a relentless motor draft Express likened to Russel Westbrook \([http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Bruce\-Brown\-71658/](http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Bruce-Brown-71658/)\)

He’s kind of a jack\-of\-all\-trades type of player at this point. He’s tenacious on D \(see what I did there\) and can switch due to his athleticism and length, and he’s a good passer and rebounder

His line this past year: 11.4/7.1/4.0 with 1.3 steals and almost 1 block a game.

At this point he can’t shoot and he’s pretty raw scoring wise. If you’re thinking it might be a little redundant to have him and Nwaba, you may be right. Taking him would be a gamble on his elite athletic potential and relentless mentality. Fred has shown he can double as a shooting coach, so maybe he can help Brown take a leap there.

**Why pick Aaron Holiday?**

Aaron Holiday is Justin and Jrue’s brother so if you had to guess, you’d probably think he’s good at basketball. Well he is. I actually think he may be underrated as a prospect due to his brothers, some people seem to insinuate he’s only being considered because he’s related to them. Well, he’s not and \*BOLD PREDICTION ALERT\* he will end up a better player than Justin, you can @ me.

Aaron Holiday is a 6’1 PG who had a pretty prolific junior year. He averaged 20/3.7/6 on 46/43/83 \(6 attempts from 3\) and was a career 42&#37; shooter on 427 shots. Might sound similar to Brunson, but he’s not as physically limited. He has a 6’6 wingspan that helps him on the defensive end where he’s been very pesky but inconsistent. He has more shot diversity and is far quicker and more explosive. He can playmake, finish with either hand, and has a floater game. He operates the pick and roll very well too.

His scouting reports are glowing and his flaws all appear to be fixable with coaching

——\> [http://nbadraft.theringer.com/——\>](http://nbadraft.theringer.com/——>) [https://www.thestepien.com/aaron\-holiday/](https://www.thestepien.com/aaron-holiday/)

Aaron Holiday is just a really good player and I think would be an instant upgrade to our bench. If we draft a wing and Justin is pushed to our bench, they may have some built in chemistry too. He has 2 way starting PG upside too, and I think would be a fantastic add at 22. A Holiday\-Holiday\-Valentine\-Portis led bench sounds pretty intriguing.

**Why pick Shamorie Ponds?**

Don’t you miss the days of watching Derrick Rose? The explosiveness! The speed! The strength! The size! Stacy always said Too big, too strong, too fast! Would you like another point guard like that? Well Ponds can’t help you there. He’s not even close to the level of athlete Rose was, BUT he is similar in one area: Creativity in finishing. There are guys like Westbrook and Lebron who are fantastic at getting to the basket, but don’t utilize much creativity or finesse when they’re there. There’s a lot of guys like James Harden who don’t even try to score when they drive, they just hope for contact. Then there’s a dying breed, namely Derrick Rose still, Kyrie, and Steph Curry. Guys who actually try and finish around defenders with acrobatic moves and creativity. Well if you’re like me and you love layups more than dunks, you’ll like Ponds

Just watch what he did to Duke earlier this year —\> [https://youtu.be/JCz8anK\-AEc](https://youtu.be/JCz8anK-AEc)

Ponds is very quick, and you can see he utilizes a lot floaters and wrong foot layups to keep defenders off balance along with his creativity at the rim. He’s more akin to a Kemba like player than Rose, but you can see some flashes in that clip. His numbers weren’t fantastic, but much like Trae Young it’s a product of the situation he’s in and some bad decision making. He may have some two way potential also.

Here’s the article that made me fall in love with Ponds, they can give you a way more accurate picture of his game —\> [https://94feetreport.com/draft\-profile\-shamorie\-ponds\-a3c55839a779](https://94feetreport.com/draft-profile-shamorie-ponds-a3c55839a779)

If he comes out, which is a big If at this point, I believe he’ll be the 2nd best PG in the draft and a potential steal at 22. However his stock is very low right now and if he doesn’t think he’ll go in the 1st I don’t believe he’ll come out this year.

**Why pick Jontay Porter?**

He’s really just a smart basketball player. He’s really good at putting himself in the right spots on offense and defense, he makes the right plays, and has a lot of potential as a ball handler and shooter. He’s slightly turnover prone at this point because he tries to do a little too much and he needs a ton of work on his body in order to be an NBA athlete. Taking him would be the complete opposite of a typical gamble. You take him for his skill set and hope he can add athleticism along the way. He had the highest body fat &#37; at the combine so its clear he can improve his body a lot.

If you're a fan of Wendell Carter as a prospect, I think you'll be a fan on Jontay Porter also. Here's some somewhat cherry picked similarities in their scouting

*Some of Wendell’s strengths as listed by the Stepien*

•	Outside shot looks very promising. Shooting 48.6&#37; from three on 37 attempts so far, and 72.5&#37; from the stripe. Smooth and confident shot in mid\-range areas.

•	Plus feel for the game. Has a 1:1 A/TO ratio, shown the ability to pass on the move and in the high post. Projects well to “short\-roll” situations as a decision maker.

•	Good handle for a big guy. Has shown flashes of attacking closeouts and taking big guys who press up on him off the dribble. Could develop an off\-the\-dribble shot.

•	Pretty good awareness defensively. Disciplined about rotating to the rim and challenging shots. Makes up for his relatively slow feet with smart positioning.

•	Does the little things on offense well. Good screener for a young big guy, knows how to play high low, seals his man when guard penetrates his way. Handle and smarts will allow him to function in dribble handoff sets.

*Some of Jontay’s strengths as listed by the Stepien*

•	High\-level shooter for a big man. Has a quick and compact release, and is comfortable shooting in pick\-and\-pop or spot\-up situations. Shooting 37.7&#37; from three on an encouraging 8.1 3PA/40 and 76.5&#37; at the line. Projects to be a true shooting 5 in the NBA.

•	Elite court vision and passing. Great at kicking out of doubles in the post, decisive and smart in the way he swings the ball around the perimeter. Will be a dynamic passer in “short\-roll” situations in the NBA.

•	Fantastic handle for a big guy. Comfortable attacking closeouts and putting the ball on the deck in transition. His shooting, passing, and dribbling combination make him a difficult guard in pick\-and\-pop situations.

•	Extremely smart help defender. Always in the right position making backline rotations. Gets a lot of “point\-of\-release” blocks because he is in the right place.

•	Gets himself involved in the action offensively. A good screen setter with a good sense of angles and is always looking to find someone to screen, or advance the offense in some way.

Here’s full scouting reports if you wanna read more about him —\> [https://www.thestepien.com/jontay\-porter/—\>](https://www.thestepien.com/jontay-porter/—>) [http://nbadraft.theringer.com/](http://nbadraft.theringer.com/)

Here’s someone who broke down his fit with the lakers, but it’s still full of a lot of good info that can apply to us —\> [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.silverscreenandroll.com/platform/amp/2018/5/15/17329644/la\-lakers\-draft\-profile\-missouri\-jontay\-porter](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.silverscreenandroll.com/platform/amp/2018/5/15/17329644/la-lakers-draft-profile-missouri-jontay-porter)

Ideally, he’d be a guy who can protect the rim, hold up on switches, and stretch the floor. My dream would also be for him to become a good enough ball handler to where he runs PnR with Lauri. He’s just a really skilled player and seems to be a good teammate and with development he may end up being the center we need.

**Why pick Melvin Frazier?**

He is the best defender in this draft. He is 6’5 with a monster 7’2 wingspan and crazy athleticism. Luckily, Draft Express \(the best scouting website before they were bought by ESPN, put behind a paywall, and relegated to writing articles with far less detail than usual\) was still able to put out videos on what type of player Frazier is on offense and defense

Melvin Frazier Offense ——\> [https://youtu.be/uBje1tZTWUs](https://youtu.be/uBje1tZTWUs)

Melvin Frazier defense ——\> [https://youtu.be/McCVdpx1DFI](https://youtu.be/McCVdpx1DFI)

His shot is not a sure bet yet, but his defensive capabilities are undeniable and having him to throw at our future competition would be extremely valuable, and he still has a lot of room to grow on offense.

**Why pick Mitchell Robinson?**

You’re feeling pretty lucky that’s why. You’ll need to be because we have no idea whether he’ll be a great player or a complete bust, and that’s what comes with guys you haven’t seen in college. Overall, he’s a super athletic center who blocks shots, rebounds, and from what he’s said has a jump shot. Here are some of his high school scouting notes from draft Express.

**Strengths**

⁃	Great combination of height, length, reach and athleticism for a center prospect. Measured 7'0 in shoes, with a 7'3 ½ wingspan and a 9'2 standing reach.

⁃	Not bulky or strong right now, but has wide shoulders that look like they can add weight over time. Lower body isn't bad either

⁃	Moves extremely well. Fluid. Terrific rim\-runner. Quick off his feet. Pogo stick type leaper. Gets up for lob finishes with ease. Great potential as a finisher off two feet. Covers ground exceptionally well

⁃	Very good hands, Has a budding skill\-level that can be harnessed into something productive over time. Shooting stroke looks decent. Ball comes out of hand cleanly with nice rotation. Throws in mid\-range and turnaround jumpers. Shows flashes of finishing with both hands.

⁃	Has a bit of a handle and some footwork. Doesn't really know what he's doing but has some skill

⁃	Averaged 20 rebounds per\-40 minutes in the EYBL, best in the competition's history. 8 offensive rebounds per\-40 also #1 in EYBL history.

⁃	Quick off his feet as a shot blocker. Led the EYBL in both blocks per\-game and per\-40. Second best shot\-blocker in EYBL history after Nerlens Noel.

⁃	Length and ability to cover ground gives him tremendous potential as a pick and roll defender

⁃	Average feel isn't that much of a detriment considering his expected role. Doesn't overthink things. Just goes out and makes plays

**Weaknesses**

⁃	Has high hips and a bit of an awkward frame. Has a ways to go to maximize his frame

⁃	Skill\-level is a work in progress in five on five settings. Shows flashes in practice but is a ways away from translating that to game competition.

⁃	Doesn't really know how to play. Awareness, fundamentals, IQ all have a long ways to go.

⁃	Gets lost off the ball defensively. Gives up deep post position without resistance. Gets overpowered by stronger players on a regular basis.

⁃	Foul prone. Will likely have some trouble staying on the court early on until he learns how to play without fouling

⁃	Gets rebounds off his tools, doesn't really box out.

⁃	Doesn't always appear to have the most serious approach. Laid\-back demeanor

⁃	A year old for his class  

So he’s really boom or bust. Best rebounder in EYBL history? Sounds pretty great. But he didn’t really box out and got it off his tools? Yikes. Doesn’t over think things, just goes out and makes plays? Cool. Doesn’t know how to play, IQ, awareness, and fundamentals all have a long way to go? Not so cool.

Here’s a hard guy to figure out. If you watch an interview with him, you’ll notice he pretty much gives one word answers and as short a reply as possible. This interview in particular is odd —\> [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9G0JrtkWreIHe](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9G0JrtkWreIHe) answers succinctly, but sometimes it appears he doesn’t even understand the question. Then there was the whole debacle on why he didn’t play college basketball, which you can read more about here —\> [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/college\-basketball/2017/8/2/16083402/mitchell\-robinson\-western\-kentucky\-transfer\-nba\-draftOne](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/college-basketball/2017/8/2/16083402/mitchell-robinson-western-kentucky-transfer-nba-draftOne) day he was at Western Kentucky and practicing, and he just decided pack up all his stuff and go home without telling anyone. They didn’t know until he didn’t show up for practice, and after checking his dorm they found it empty.

So is he just kind of dumb? I don’t know, because in the interview he stated he started playing basketball because he realized it was the only way he would get to college, and that he liked math and science. He also expresses his interest in computer science, which he does again at the end of this interview —\> [https://youtu.be/FRcA4QLyGUQ](https://youtu.be/FRcA4QLyGUQ) he’s still so young, he could be a smart kid who’s just awkward and doesn’t really know how to handle social situations, like interviews or letting his coaches know he’s headed home, but I can’t really be sure.

So overall, if you believe in his potential and that we can develop him into a great player, he would the perfect two way compliment to Lauri in our front court. he could also be another Javale McGee where he never quite plays up to his tools.

**Why pick Bruno Fernando?**

Bruno Fernando is another project, although probably a safer one because we’ve seen him in college. He is a 6’10 center with a 7’4 wingspan, and crazy athleticism. He covers a ton of ground on the floor, has great defensive range, and has an NBA ready body. He also has a really dope name.

Here’s one play that displays his athleticism—\> [https://youtu.be/\-eZqcBYPOtAHere’s](https://youtu.be/-eZqcBYPOtAHere’s) another —\> [https://youtu.be/odhuwWMahHc](https://youtu.be/odhuwWMahHc)

Here’s some shortened tape if you’d like to see how he is in a game Vs Michigan State —\> [https://youtu.be/mPeUY\-4W8MAVs](https://youtu.be/mPeUY-4W8MAVs) Nebraska —\> [https://youtu.be/anZ7dIkfjH4](https://youtu.be/anZ7dIkfjH4)

Fernando’s ceiling is a guy who can be a dominant presence protecting the rim and out guarding on the perimeter, as well as a rim runner on offense. He has showed flashes of touch around the post too, and his jump shot mechanics are pretty solid. He shot 74&#37; from the free throw line in college and there’s video \( [https://mobile.twitter.com/draftexpress/status/996966869633503232](https://mobile.twitter.com/draftexpress/status/996966869633503232) \)of him knocking down open jumpers at the combine, so he may have some shooting touch.

As I’ve said before, all we really need is a big man who can protect the rim, hold up on switches, and knockdown jumpers \(this part is more of a luxury but would be awesome\) and Fernando has serious potential to be that type of player.

**Why pick Keita Bates Diop?**

Keita Bates Diop, or KBD as I have affectionately never called him, is a 6’8 forward with a giant 7’3 wingspan. He’s a 3 and D wing with some scoring upside, although he’ll likely just be a shooter who can take advantage of mismatches in the post. He also moves well off ball and is a good cutter.

This past year he won Big Ten POY and averaged 20/8.7/1.6 on 48/36/79 with about 5 attempts from 3 per game.

His defensive versatility is his main selling point, and he’ll likely be able to play either forward spot, and maybe some small ball center on rare occasion. If you wanna read more in depth about it, here’s a good discussion about his defensive abilities ——\> [https://94feetreport.com/keita\-bates\-diop\-the\-next\-prototype\-8768092b870a](https://94feetreport.com/keita-bates-diop-the-next-prototype-8768092b870a)

I think he would be a nice solid pick, someone we can slot in at the 3 who can play good defense and stretch the floor, the only concern to have when picking him is that he may be at his best as a 4 in the NBA. If the bulls believe that, they should pass on him in favor of one of the other 3 and D guys, but if they’re confident he’ll be a SF then he’d be a great fit for us.

**Why pick Afernee Simons?**

I’m sure everyone here has already heard about Simons, but he’s a combo guard who could potentially come out of high school straight into the NBA. Simons is a great athlete with 3 level scoring potential and defensive potential due to his length. So what’s not to like? Well mostly the fact that he’s a high schooler with a high school body. Strength and physical development will be a big issue for a guy who already had trouble dealing with physicality and contact in high school, and he’s still figuring which guard position suits him best. If we draft Simons, he probably won’t be able to contribute for a few years

Good article on him and his strengths \+ weaknesses —\> [https://www.thestepien.com/2018/03/16/anfernee\-simons\-wrong\-initiator/](https://www.thestepien.com/2018/03/16/anfernee-simons-wrong-initiator/)

Good video breakdown —\> [https://youtu.be/9xAzcz4f08E](https://youtu.be/9xAzcz4f08E)

Simons, much like Robinson, is a total gamble. He could be the steal of the draft, maybe if we saw him in college he would be in the convo for #1 next year? Or maybe if we saw him in college he would have been completely exposed? There’s no way to know.

We do have the 7th pick, so even though we’re a rebuilding team, the 22nd can be treated at somewhat of a luxury. It would bolster our team for whoever we choose to work out, but it’s not going to derail us if they don’t. If the FO are confident they can develop him, his potential is worthy of investing in.

**Why pick Elie Okobo?**

I don’t think there’s been much, if any, talk about Okobo on this sub. I don’t think many people have even heard of him at this point, so I’ll introduce you. Elie Okobo is a 20 year old French guard and probably the second best European prospect in the draft.

Here’s a little blurb from ESPN that sums up his game

“Okobo has attracted significant attention this season from NBA scouts, not just due to his productivity but also his size, 6\-8 wingspan and scoring instincts. He's a fluid athlete who plays above the rim regularly, changes speeds smoothly in the open floor, is a prolific pick\-and\-roll player who can find the open man and has proven to be a capable shot\-maker, pulling up off the dribble from long vantage points.”

The ringer draft guide lists his strengths as:

•	Impressive shooter off the dribble. He uses step\-backs, pull\-ups, and sidesteps to get his shot off. It’s like he’s mimicking James Harden.

•	Good spot\-up shooter who has potential to hit shots off screens if he focuses on mastering his footwork.

•	Active off\-ball cutter. He grew up playing two\-guard, and it shows with his movement relocating, running through screens, and cutting.

•	Skilled at\-rim finisher who has touch, uses either hand, and can make difficult wrong\-footed layups against length and athleticism.

•	He’s a fairly explosive leaper in the open floor. He’ll sometimes surprise you with big dunks driving in traffic.

•	Improved ball handler who changes speeds, uses spin moves and Eurosteps, and shows good feel and pace in the pick\-and\-roll.

•	Solid passer who makes basic reads and has progressed at advanced ones like cross\-court kickouts.

•	Flashes good defensive potential when he’s engaged. He has long arms and the quickness to contain dribble penetration.

He’s a similar player to Afernee Simons, although I would say he’s better at this point because he plays in a professional league. He’s also still in the process of figuring out what guard position he’ll end up at, he’s trying to be a point guard but he still needs to shore up some areas of his game.

Okobo has a ton of potential, an intriguing skill set, and a great physical profile. If GarPax are considering drafting the highest upside player at 22, I think Okobo should be ahead of Simons and Robinson. He has as much potential as them, and will likely be able to contribute earlier than them.

If you’d like to read more in depth about him, here’s a really great article —\> [https://www.thestepien.com/2018/02/15/hiding\-plain\-sight\-elie\-okobo/](https://www.thestepien.com/2018/02/15/hiding-plain-sight-elie-okobo/)

**Why pick Jacob Evans?**

Jacob is a nice 3 and D wing who should have a solid career and could fit right in nicely at SF. He’s a pretty solid shooter at 38&#37; on 462 attempts and 76&#37; career FT shooter. He’s a solid defender too. He’s about 6’6 with a 6’9 wingspan, solid size to go with solid athleticism. Key word: solid. Nothing about him really jumps off the page, he’s just a good player. He’s not a lockdown 1 v 1 defender, but within a team concept he’s very good at rotations and communicating, and he’s effective at switching

Here’s a good article detailing this strength —\> [https://www.thestepien.com/2018/03/09/biggest\-evaluation\-inefficiency\-draft\-team\-defense/](https://www.thestepien.com/2018/03/09/biggest-evaluation-inefficiency-draft-team-defense/)

He’s really comfortable in embracing his role and seems to be a smart player all around, here’s an interview where he shows some of that —\> [https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/video/jacob\-evans\-i\-can\-fit\-any\-offense](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/video/jacob-evans-i-can-fit-any-offense)

He can fill a need for us right away and even if we pick him over some higher upside guys, I don’t think we’d regret it looking back in a few years

**Why pick Josh Okogie?**

Josh Okogie would be a pick in the same vein as Bruce Brown, except he can shoot. He’s more of a scorer though than a do it all type guy. He’s 6’4 with a massive 7 foot wingspan which gives him a lot of defensive versatility

Here’s his strengths and weaknesses from the Ringer draft guide:

**Strengths**

•	Has the versatility to switch onto multiple positions given his excellent length, muscular frame, and great agility.

•	Strong help defender who hustles, stays engaged, invades passing lanes, and blocks shots from the weak side.

•	Plus rebounder for his position.

•	Good shooting potential if he raises his release point and speeds up his gather; as is, his shot is susceptible to closeouts by NBA athletes.

•	Has shown the ability to score off the bounce with one\-dribble pull\-ups or step\-backs; if those fall in the NBA, driving lanes will open.

•	Intelligent off\-ball cutter; he’ll be at his best in a non\-feature role.

**Weaknesses**•	Low shooting release.

•	Needs to get better at finishing tough below\-the\-rim layups; he drew a lot of fouls in college, but may not get the benefit of the whistle in the NBA.

•	Average passer.

•	Lacks an advanced handle and doesn’t change directions with the agility necessary to run pick\-and\-roll at a high level.

Another scouting report —\> [https://www.thestepien.com/josh\-okogie/](https://www.thestepien.com/josh-okogie/)

Overall, Okogie is a good, strong athlete with great tools and a lot scoring potential. He needs to refine pretty much his entire offensive game, but he has a lot of potential to be a very effective two way player that will be useful off our bench and can play alongside Dunn when we need to lock down.

**Why not pick Dzanan Musa?** He’s one of the most popular names that comes up when discussing who to take at 22. I think taking him would be a mistake for a few reasons.

The first is that his overall skill set doesn’t warrant a 1st round selection in my eyes. He doesn’t have any NBA ready traits outside of his shooting. He’s not that great of a shooter either, he can make big shots, but his overall shot selection is terrible. Due to that, he’s a lifetime 31&#37; shooter on 558 attempts.

Maybe his efficiency goes up as he adapts to more of role player role, but that’s my 2nd concern. I don’t believe he’ll ever settle into just being a role player. He is really reckless on the court and is just a straight gunner, there’s a lot of Mirotic in his game where he pulls up randomly from way beyond the arc for no reason, he feels he has a green light at all times. Dunn and Lavine already have somewhat of a power struggle going on, throwing another alpha dog with even less talent than them into the mix will only make things worse.

The third reason I don’t wanna draft him is because of his defense. He is tall enough for SF but he’ll probably end up at SG. He doesn’t have the strength to handle wing players, and he really doesn’t have the lateral quickness to handle anyone on defense. He plays hunched over and I think it hurts his defensive abilities.

Overall, I think he’ll be an inefficient chucker who plays bad defense and doesn’t fill a need for us. I would steer clear of him.

Here’s a breakdown video on him if you wanna see what his game is like, draft Express and others do have far higher opinions of him than I do —\> [https://youtu.be/\-uMBgJ5mLQs](https://youtu.be/-uMBgJ5mLQs)

**Why not pick Grayson Allen?** Grayson Allen is a pretty good athlete and shooter. He’s not a good defender. He’s also a dirty player who’s been too scared to come into the NBA despite having a chance to be drafted every year he’s played in college, and he throws tantrums when things don’t go his way. No thanks.

[https://youtu.be/tcEq7xhxD4g](https://youtu.be/tcEq7xhxD4g)

**Why not pick Kevin Huerter?**

Kevin Huerter is a 6’7 SG who’s a great shooter with average length. I wasn’t sure whether to include him or not in this, but his stock has been rising and he’s been talked about more so I figured I’d throw him in. He is a great shooter and one of the best, most pure ones in the draft and I think he has a chance to be a solid Korver/Redick type player, I just don’t think he’s good enough to pick at 22 or that he fills a need for us. I’ve named other guys who could be 2 guards, but they all have defensive capabilities which can help compensate for Zach’s troubles on that end when we need to sub him out. Huerter can’t fill that need, and ultimately I think we have a lot of better options. Here’s a breakdown of what type of player he is from the Ringer draft guide if you wanna know more about him

**Strengths**•	Excellent spot\-up shooter with deep range. No one in the draft is better at hitting off\-balance jumpers off screens.

•	Comfortable hitting one\-two dribble pull\-ups or step\-backs from deep.

•	He quickly attacks closeouts rather than holding the ball, is aggressive on straight\-line drives, and finishes with either hand inside.

•	Solid passer either off the dribble or when facilitating on the perimeter. He displays a high basketball IQ.

•	Plays hard on defense with good length, instincts, and focus. He’s not afraid to contest a shot even if it means being posterized.

**Weaknesses**

•	Needs to quicken his shooting form. He brings the ball far out away from his body, which gives defenders an extra beat to contest his release.

•	Lean frame and lack of quickness could make him a defensive liability unless he gets a lot stronger and develops better fundamentals.

•	Takes too many risks as a passer by throwing the ball into traffic.",36,163,Making the case for our options at 22 (Long post),https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/8km1v6/making_the_case_for_our_options_at_22_long_post/

"So guys now that some hours have passed after a disappointing lottery for us I decided to make a post to explore all the scenarios that could happen in the lottery for the Bulls.

I think we still have some decent chance and the situation is not as grim as a lot of us (me included) felt right after the lottery so let's tackle down all of them.

So to popular believe there are 6 top prospect in this draft (or at least there are 6 guys we would be definitely happy to get) and they are, in no particular order,: Ayton, Doncic, Jackson Jr, Bagley, Bamba and MPJ.

Then there is a second tier wich include solid role player and high risk high reward picks: Mikal & Miles Bridges and Wendell Carter belong to the former in my opinion while Trae Young and Collin Sexton to the latter.

With our pick we found ourselves in between among those 2 group so any team above us picking a player from the second group would lead us to get the last from the first.

I would like to start right away with the scenario a lot of people on this sub believe would be the worst one for us: Orlando doesn't draft Trae Young but the last of the first group.

I get why a lot of people don't like this scenario (I feel the same) but even in this situation there are 2 picks that the bulls could do: they could choose the safer road and pick Mikal Bridges wich is a great fit for the team and could very well be an Otto porter kind of player.

It's definitely not the kind of generational talent that can change the course of a franchise but is the kind of player you need to have to win championship nontheless.

The other pick is the most high risk high rewar one: picking Trae Young. I know there are a lot of cons on this move and I will let other people do that work, it is not an ideal solution but it could work out: for all the possibilities of Trae becoming the next Flynn or Jimmer Fredette there is also a chance he could become the next Curry (how much? I don't know and no one does but it is possible) it is true that we already have dunn and lavine, in my opinion a backcourt composed of Trae Young and Dunn could work Dunn has the frame to stick with most of the 2 in the NBA and he would take the toughest assignment on defense of every match up.

We could also deploy 2 platoon of Dunn Lavine and Young Nwaba always having a great defenser alongside a (supposed) great scorer.

Drafting young has 1 more pros: as we all know learning to play PG in the NBA takes time, time spent losing without the need to bench our best players and putting us in a good position to get a decent pick in the next draft (wich I would like to remind all of the sub includes the like of RJ ""canadian god"" Barret and Zion Williamson).

What I just presented to you is our worst case scenario and, in my opinion, is not as bad as it seemed straight out of the lottery.

The better case scenarios are connecter with someone picking a player from the 2 tier group.

The only chance imo is Orlando drafting Young

IF that happens there are 3 guys in my opinion that could be there for us and I will list them from the most likely to the least.

MPJ: the player this sub wanted all along we have to hope is back injury is gone and that he can prove to be the player he was projected to be.

Mo Bamba: Basically Rudy Gobert 2.0 I like him a lot but I wonder if in the modern NBA we can afford to close game with 2 7 footer on the floor but Bamba looks more agile than Gobert so that gives me hope.

Bagley: he is a mistery honestly, it is really difficult to understand how much or how low the teams are rating him.
He showed no rim protection whatsoever in the NCAA so pairing him with Markannen (and lavine) could kill our defense but if he is there for the taking we should go for him (he is definetly another High Risk High Reward prospect).

We will not get Doncic we will not get Ayton other teams will, shitty teams in my opinion who didn't nothing to deserve the luck bestowed over them, but that doesn't mean we are fucked there are a lot of good possibilities ahead for our team let's hope whoever we end up pciking will be the best version of himself.
Stay strong Bulls!

P.S. sorry in advance for any mistakes I have made writing this down english is not my first language.","Bulls scenarios after the draft So guys now that some hours have passed after a disappointing lottery for us I decided to make a post to explore all the scenarios that could happen in the lottery for the Bulls.

I think we still have some decent chance and the situation is not as grim as a lot of us (me included) felt right after the lottery so let's tackle down all of them.

So to popular believe there are 6 top prospect in this draft (or at least there are 6 guys we would be definitely happy to get) and they are, in no particular order,: Ayton, Doncic, Jackson Jr, Bagley, Bamba and MPJ.

Then there is a second tier wich include solid role player and high risk high reward picks: Mikal & Miles Bridges and Wendell Carter belong to the former in my opinion while Trae Young and Collin Sexton to the latter.

With our pick we found ourselves in between among those 2 group so any team above us picking a player from the second group would lead us to get the last from the first.

I would like to start right away with the scenario a lot of people on this sub believe would be the worst one for us: Orlando doesn't draft Trae Young but the last of the first group.

I get why a lot of people don't like this scenario (I feel the same) but even in this situation there are 2 picks that the bulls could do: they could choose the safer road and pick Mikal Bridges wich is a great fit for the team and could very well be an Otto porter kind of player.

It's definitely not the kind of generational talent that can change the course of a franchise but is the kind of player you need to have to win championship nontheless.

The other pick is the most high risk high rewar one: picking Trae Young.

"First off, I'm no expert. I'm a simple man. After knowing we'd picked Lauri, I went to watch his vids playing at Arizona. From there, I fell in love with him. So judging from my liking, I would be happy if the Bulls pick Mikal Bridges at 7th.

Of course, as a Bulls fan, whoever they picked would also get my full support. It's just my simple opinion. I hope to see more of what Mikal can do aside from what he has done in college, just like what Lauri has shown in the Bulls jersey.","Are the people that are high on MPJ now also the same persons that had doubted Lauri on draft day?

"Here is how i view the draft board using the tiered approach:  
T1: Ayton  
T2: Jackson/Bagley/Doncic/MPJ  
T3: Mik Bridges/Carter/Bamba/Young  
T4: Sexton/Knox/Mil Bridges/Robert Williams/Zhaire Smith  
  
I don’t intend this as a thread to argue over which players belong in which tier.  I know some have Doncic in T1, Bamba in T2 and Porter and Sexton in T3. I wanted to share this to take a step back and look at how we might still be drafting a very meaningful player. This class doesn’t have any surefire superstars, but the top 11 all could end up being very productive starters if not All Stars themselves.
  
Takeaway: The best we could hope for is someone from T2 to drop to #7.  Realistically, I think the only player capable of dropping 2 slots is MPJ because of his injury history. Best case scenario is that he falls and we feel confident that his injury hasn’t hurt his athleticism/longevity and we nab him.  
  
Takeaway: If we aren’t confident in MPJs recovery, there are still very good players in T3 I would be happy to select in Mikal Bridges and Wendell Carter.  
  
Takeaway: Worst case scenario (in my mind) is if Ayton/Jackson/Bagley/Doncic/Bridges/Carter go top 6 and we don’t feel good about MPJ.  We are then looking at boom or bust in rolling the dice on any of MPJ/Bamba/Young. Still not a terrible spot to be in as we are still able to grab a boom or bust player, but our rebuild would depend highly upon long odds of that player realizing their potential.  
  
Conclusion: I still feel pretty good sitting at #7 of getting another good piece to the team., I feel my worst case scenario is pretty unlikely of happening (maybe 8-10%) due to teams ahead of us drafting somewhat on fit.  MPJ getting a clean bill of health negates the risk of us sitting in a tough spot, so root for that!","My take on the #7 Here is how i view the draft board using the tiered approach:

"Because why **THE FUCK** not???

 I want MPJ as much as everybody else on the sub, but if he's not there at 7 (which I am confident he won't considering how talented he is), I wouldn't mind taking a shot at Trae Young. If the draft shakes up how most analysts see it, Young would be the only player left at 7 who has superstar potential. Yes, there is also great bust potential with him, but what do we have to lose? Swing for the damn fences! Trust in Hoiberg's ability to develop young talent! If Young pans out, that pick and roll with Lauri would be absolutely LETHAL. 

He doesn't deserve the immense hate he is receiving and is a victim of the herd mentality you often find on Reddit. People are irrationally hating on the kid, zeroing on his weaknesses while ignoring his massive potential. Contrastingly, guys like Wendell Carter and Mikal Bridges have weaknesses as well but they are given a pass. I say FUCK THE NOISE, and shoot for the stars.

"The NBA draft lottery will be held tomorrow at 7:30 pm. We will see what this entire season has gotten us, pick-wise. The lottery is in Chicago, so hopefully Adam will bless us with a Top 3 pick.
Here are the % chances the Bulls have for each pick:

1st: 5.3

2nd:	6.0

3rd: 7.0

6th: 44.0

7th: 33.1

8th: 4.5	

9th: 0.1

 The scenarios I see playing out tomorrow:

**A. We land the 6th pick, as expected.**

This is fine, assuming the top 5 goes Ayton/Doncic/JJJ/Bagley/Trae, we will have the choice between MPJ or Mo Bamba. MPJ has injury concerns, and also does not bring much to the table besides scoring. Sure he is big, but he has little experience playing against college competition. His defensive prowess and all around game must develop for him to warrant a 6th overall pick. If he only develops his scoring, he must be able to consistently produce. His absolute ceiling is Kevin Durant, but I wouldn't expect him to become a generational scorer just yet.

Mo Bamba is an incredible athlete, however there have been questions surrounding how his offensive game will translate to the NBA, and if he will be confident stepping outside to hit jumpers. Right now I would put his floor at Clint Capela, a lob-catching rim protector. His ceiling is a floor-spacing Rudy Gobert. If he became a 35% 3pt shooter that would be terrific, but for now teams are looking at his defensive upside. 

**B. A team jumps ahead of us and we slide to 7.**

This would leave us with one of the two mentioned above, if the top 5 go Ayton/Doncic/JJJ/Bagley/Trae. Worst case scenario, Trae Young drops and the top 6 go some variation of Ayton/Doncic/JJJ/Bagley/Bamba/MPJ. This would leave us with the Tier 3 (imo) talent like Wendell Carter Jr, and the Bridges. Trae Young is a Tier 2 Talent for me, but he is way too boom or bust for me to be comfortable with the pick, especially with our PG position being relatively secure. 

Mikal Bridges is the best talent available here. He has shown the ability to shoot the ball, finish, and defend at a high level. He might only work out to become a solid 3 and D player, but he will have a long career if his skills translate. I can definitely see him developing into the poorest man's Kawhi Leonard.

**C. We luck into the top 3.**

Hooray! Our young players actually showed great promise, winning us some games we shouldn't've, and we were rewarded for it! Now we pick from the cream of the crop. If we manage to land #1, we are picking Ayton no doubt. DeAndre Ayton has all the tools to be a rim protector, he just lacks the instincts and motor. However, his offensive game has drawn comparisons to Karl-Anthony Towns, a young big who just averaged 21/12/2 in a terrible system which did not adhere to his strengths (Sorry Thibs). Ayton can develop into a terrific player, but no one knows how some players' skill sets will change. In fact, KAT was touted for his defense coming out of Kentucky. DeAndre Ayton is the next great offensive big, and we would be foolish to pass on him at #1 for his defensive concerns. His ceiling is Patrick Ewing, if he can overcome his defensive struggles.

Our two biggest needs are SF and C. Luka Doncic is said to be capable of playing 1-3, however is mainly on-ball. If we are sitting at #2 with Ayton off the board, I understand we don't pick according to needs and just take the best player available. I haven't done an extensive amount of research into Doncic, however I do know Kris Dunn and Zach LaVine don't thrive off the ball. His athleticism has also been questioned. I might seem totally down on Doncic, but his BBIQ is amazing and he is dominating the second-best league in the world. He could develop into a star, but I personally feel his ceiling is limited. (If you would like to correct me, feel free to comment or PM). His ceiling is James Harden, a player who uses craftiness instead of explosiveness to dominate the game.

If we land the 3rd overall pick, we take Doncic or Ayton without hesitation if they are still available. If they both are off the board, I believe the best pick here is Jaren Jackson Jr. He is 18, and turns 19 in September. He has shown the ability to hit the 3 well and protect the rim. His main trouble has been fouling when contesting shots, and his low play time. He is an advanced stats god, but that doesn't mean that will expand to 36 real minutes of NBA game time. He needs major development to be able to stay focused and keep his man in front, but the payoff will be massive. His shooting mechanics are sound, and thankfully the Bulls FO have shown the ability to develop players' perimeter games. The Ringer's draft guide has compared him to Myles Turner, which seems accurate. Myles doesn't have the strongest post game, and is mainly used to space the floor and protect the rim. I see JJJ having much more offensive potential than Myles Turner, putting his absolute ceiling at Kevin Garnett, a great defender with a terrific post game.


Obviously the best case scenario would be the first overall pick, but anything could happen, and having a high pick doesn't guarantee you a good player. Let's all place our trust in Adam Silver to secure our pick, and more into Garpax to make the right choice. Go Bulls!","Lottery is Tomorrow!

"Hey y’all, I’m some guy and this is my pre-lottery 1st round mock draft:

1. Phoenix Suns ~ Luka Dončić - SF/PG
(Sun’s new head coach speaks very highly of him)

2. Memphis Grizzlies ~ DeAndre Ayton - PF/C
(Ayton will get his wish of playing the 4 next to Gasol... DeAndre also resembles a Grizzly Bear)

3. Dallas Mavericks ~ Marvin Bagley III - PF/C
(Dirk’s replacement)

4. Atlanta Hawks ~ Trae Young - PG
(Schroeder having off-court issues; Trae could be insurance with superstar potential.

5. Orlando Magic ~ Mohamed Bamba - C
(Create a lengthy defensive identity with last years pick Isaac. I could also see them trading down or taking a chance on Sexton) 

6. Chicago Bulls* ~ Michael Porter Jr - SF/PF
(Destiny. Fits need and highest potential.) 

7. Sacramento Kings ~ Jaren Jackson Jr - PF/C
(Highest potential and has lots of time to develop)

8. Cleveland Cavilers ~ Collin Sexton - PG
(Fits need and could set the tone for post-LeBron era)

9. New York Knicks ~ Miles Bridges - SF/PF
(They need a hype man and Miles can spark that electricity) 

10. Philadelphia 76ers ~ Mikal Bridges - SF/SG
(Perfect fit for the now win part of the process) 

11. Charlotte Hornets ~ Wendell Carter Jr - C
(BPA and it’s always nice to have a backup plan when D Howard is your starter)

12. Los Angeles Clippers ~ Shai Gilgeous-Alexander - PG/SG
(Nice fit next to Lou)

13. Los Angeles Clippers ~ Kevin Knox - SF/PF
(Chemistry with previous pick plus time to develop under similar player mold, Tobias Harris) 

14. Denver Nuggets ~ Robert Williams - C
(Jokic could use a defensive counterpart)

15. Washington Wizards ~ Mitchell Robinson - C
(Gortat is aging and has team chemistry issues. Can’t hurt to take a risk on Mitchell. 

16. Phoenix Suns ~ Džanan Musa - SF
(European Fever)

17. Milwaukee Bucks ~ Lonnie Walker IV - SG
(OJ Mayo 2.0)

18. San Antonio Spurs ~ Zhaire Smith - SG/SF
(Popovichs new post Kawhi-project. Texas native.)

19. Atlanta Hawks ~ Anfernee Simons - SG
(Could be a lethal scoring backcourt duo with Trae. lots of time to develop)

20. Minnesota Timberwolves ~ Khyri Thomas - SG
(Defensive monster that Thibs would adore. Former teammate of last years 1st pick Justin Patton)

21. Utah Jazz ~ Chandler Hutchinson - SF/PF
(This years Kyle Kuzma? I don’t really have a reason for this pick)

22. Chicago Bulls* ~ Jontay Porter - PF/C
(The Porter’s are family driven which will boost morale bringing out the best out of each Porter. Doesn’t fit a position need which gives him the time needed to develop his game.)
  
23. Indiana Pacers ~ Jalen Brunson - PG
(Brings winning spirit and has chance to start right away)

24. Portland Trailblazers ~ Troy Brown - SG/SF
(Former Duck stays in state and provides solid defensive compliment to Lillard/McCollum duo)

25. Los Angelos Lakers ~ Gary Trent Jr - SG
(Perfect role player for the young core in place) 

26. Philadelphia 76ers ~ Donte DiVincenzo - SG
(76ers land a younger more athletic JJ Redick. Joins teammate Mikal)

27. Boston Celtics ~ Shake Milton - SG/PG
(Swiss Army Knife kind of player)

28. Golden State Warriors ~ Keita Bates-Diop - SF/PF
(BPA. His game makes me think of Iggy mixed with Draymond... just to a much lesser skilled extent)

29. Brooklyn Nets ~ Malik Newman - SG
(Someone that really impressed me during March Madness)

30. Atlanta Hawks ~ Omari Spellman - PF/C
(Already got two small guys; get the best remaining big man who plays in modern fashion of spreading the floor) 


  For the Bulls, Another guy that popped up recently into my awareness is Jarred Vanderbilt after reading something about D’aaron fox saying he’s the best rebounder he’s ever played with. Of the small sample size I saw of him, I can’t help but get a Dennis Rodman vibe and wouldn’t mind trading say J Holiday for a second rounder. Not seeing this guy on any other mock drafts so perhaps there’s red flags I don’t know about.

"How would you all feel about Avery Bradley on a two or three year deal, at around 10 to 12 million a year with a player option? Would you like him as a backup shooting guard over resigning David Nwaba (my guess would be about 4-6 million a year)? 

Here's the run down on Avery Bradley: still 27 years old but has many years of playoff experience, can play both guard spots, elite defensive player (two time All defensive team), averages over a steal a game, good 3 point shooter (38% with detroit last year), can play call, good touch around the rim, plays above his size. 
David Nwaba is only two years younger, cannot shoot as well, less experience, and is a restricted free agent. I like David a lot and would generally be fine with him, but for a little more money we could have a young veteran off the bench with as many intangibles as Nwaba in Bradley. He would be a good mentor for all of our young guards as well. The only concern I have with Bradley is his injury history, but he's never had a major injury so its not too alarming. In a bench role his minutes would be lessened which would help. What do you all think? Let me know!

"Entering this season, five coaches in the league have full control of their team.

* Gregg Popovich \(San Antonio Spurs\): head coach and president of basketball operations
* Doc Rivers \(Los Angeles Clippers\): head coach and general manager
* Mike Budenholzer \(Atlanta Hawks\): head coach and president of basketball operations
* Stan Van Gundy \(Detroit Pistons\): head coach and president of basketball operations
* Tom Thibodeau \(Minnesota Timberwolves\): head coach and president of basketball operations

With the recent firing of Stan Van Gundy, two coaches who have full control of the team, have been stripped of their job these last few months. The other one would be Mike Budenholzer, after splitting up with the Hawks.

Doc Rivers who previously have full control of the Clippers, got demoted to being just a coach now.

Two things are common with Pistons, Clippers and Hawks. They have bloated contracts and they under achieved. Thibs is in the same situation, with a first round exit and pending Jimmy Butler and Karl Anthony Towns extensions. Thibs situation in Minnesota hinges on expiring contracts of Jimmy Butler, Jeff Teague and Taj Gibson. The Wolves has so much to prove next season.

Pop on the other hand have Aldridge, Manu and Parker expiring, with Kawhi silently demanding a trade, is in the verge of losing all his keys players. Would Pop still be up for a rebuild? My guess is he would hang it up, if he loses Kawhi.

Bulls FO and ownership has been tagged cheap, while the team they assembled have been overachieving since 2010\(except for 2016\-2017\). Two season ago, Bulls could have been the first eight seed to sweep the top seed, unfortunately Rajon Rondo injury happened. And just this season, a supposedly tank team have been winning against top competition.

We all know that Thibs and FO doesn't have a good relationship. But I can't blame the ownership in sticking with GarPax, because they have done a good job in staying in the game. I really appreciate that our FO wasn't controlled by it's coach\(Thibs was popular that time\) and it's superstar\(Jimmy\). Though much of the fan base hates GarPaxDorf, I think we were lucky to have the tasks splitted up\(basketball operations would be Pax, contract transactions obviously Gar and coaching in Fred\), rather than controlled by a single person.","Is this the end of the era of coaches who have full control of their franchises?

"These are the top 10 players on my draft board that I would have if I were in the Bulls front office. I did an analysis (not a ranking) piece already on the players we could take with the [pels pick](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/89nwir/a_look_at_some_of_the_prospects_we_can_take_with/?ref=share&ref_source=link), since draft odds have been finalized I thought I would now do one for the top prospects along with a ranking element. I realize that a key piece of these rankings is addressing specific reasons why I chose a certain player over the other, so at the end of the post, I've addressed specific matchups that I thought might be more questionable/arguable. I just want to stress, that these are just my opinions, I'm not an expert in any sense, I'm just a fan.

**1. Deandre Ayton**- Ayton has all the tools and indications that he could be an All-NBA level player. On offensive, he has an excellent post up game and can finish around the rim incredibly well. He has a decent shot that will can get him an elite Joel Embiid type face up game, and will allow him to stretch the floor. He can pass out of the post when pressured by defenses. He has excellent athleticism and speed for a center and can be a nightmare in transition for other teams to guard. Defensively, it's been very clear that he's had issues. He simply wasn't a great rim protector in college despite having all the physical tools to be one and just in terms of bball iq he didn't seem to have a good feel for defensive instincts such as when to help and how to shut down players who attack the rim. On the other hand, he's an excellent rebounder, and he has the speed and agility to switch onto smaller players and hold his own. The tools to be a great rim protector are there, with the proper guidance he could become a prototypical elite defensive big in the league with the ability to shut down dribble penetration and switch pick and rolls to guard smaller players, this is however a big if. Overall, his potential and all around game is too good to pass up, if the Bulls end up with number 1 pick, I take would take Ayton. 

**2. Luka Doncic**- Can realistically play positions 1-3. Hes a transcendent playmaker who runs the pick and roll incredibly well and makes the right basketball play more often than not. For a 6'8"" guy hes a fantastic ball handler, so while he lacks elite burst his craftiness and ball handling help him get to the rim, where he can finish incredibly well with a variety of moves. He projects as a good shooter, hes a good free throw shooter, can pull up from 3, step back, or make defenders pay for going under screens although his shooting percentages from outside have drawn some concerns. On the other hand, the questions about his athleticism and speed are legitimate, there is a concern that those factors could keep him from living up to the expectations of a top 2 pick and put a cap on his potential. This also limits him defensively as hes sometimes unable to stay with faster more explosive players, although in general I think knocks against his defense have him overstated. Overall, his incredible playmaking ability, craftiness, and overall maturity gives him a high ceiling and he comes into the NBA with a high floor as well having played professionally for years.

**3. Jaren Jackson Jr.**- Arguably the best defensive big in the NCAA this year. JJJ has incredible feel for the game on the defensive end and knows just when to help, how to angle his body and long arms to block and alter shots. He's also incredibly effective for a center when switched onto guards and wings. Like with a lot of bigs, defensives won't be able to punish him by forcing switches, he has the agility to stay with faster players and the timing to still alter shots from behind if does get beat. He also has the ability to shoot the ball decently from 3, which makes him a threat in pick and pop situations and paired with markkanen opens up the lane for all sorts of hoiball possibilities. The downside is that offensively, theres not much else hes great at. Hes an ok finisher around the rim, his shot creates the potential for a face up game although his body and skill has not caught up. He can be a good rim runner and pick and roll guy but not much else. It will take a while for him to develop offensively. His defensive abilities and the potential to anchor an elite defensive in the NBA put him at the 3 spot for me. 

**4. Mo Bamba**- Bamba would have the largest wingspan in the NBA day one and this is primarily where his potential lies. Bamba has shown at the college level, albeit not as amazingly as expected but still incredibly well, the ability to be a perennial DPOY candidate with his rim protection. He also does other things well, such as pass out of the post, finish around the rim out of pick and rolls, and spacing the floor with a still in progress jumpshot that looks like it could translate to the NBA. He has the agility and quickness to stick with smaller and faster players when forced to switch. On the other hand, there are some factors that create some bust potential here. He isn't a fantastic rebounder for his size, he lacks the strength and toughness down low to battle bigger stronger centers, and his post up game is a work in progress which makes his offensive upside suspect. 

**5. Michael Porter Jr**- One of the biggest question marks in this years draft as he missed most of the season with a back injury and had an underwhelming return, averaging only 10 ppg in two games on poor shooting numbers. There are some things we do know about Porter from his high school days. He's an excellent shooter, who can pull up from 3, knock down shots from mid range, and finish at the rim. He also handles the ball well in the open court, which combined with his size, makes him incredibly dangerous in transition. He's has great athleticism for his size and has the agility and length to be a great perimeter defender. On the other hand, the back injury is a major concern, its questionable how much of the poor return from injury was just rust and how much was health related, and whether it will be a long term issue going forward. Offensively, he lacks the craftiness from a ball handling perspective to get to the rim in half court offense consistently and settles for jumpers way too often in these situations leading to inefficient and ill-advised shots. His ability to be a great defender so far has also been theoretical, his physical tools have not translated to good defense. Overall, Porter has incredible upside, but he also has some of the biggest questions about his game and health.

**6. Marvin Bagley III**- Incredible athleticism, matched with incredible speed for a big man. Offensively, he has incredible upside, he can handle the ball in the open court, he can finish around the rim, he can post up, face up, can be a lethal roll man, has great speed in transition which makes him incredibly dangerous in those situations. His jumper is questionable, but he has shown the ability to stretch the floor and has a shot to work with. He's also an interesting prospect defensively, he wont be a great rim protector, but he is a good help defender, can challenge shots at the rim and has great agility to switch onto guards and wings and stay in front of them, overall however he simply won't be a permanent NBA 5, as his body and rim protection is too lacking. This is where the primary issue with Bagley is, the fit is incredibly difficult to figure out, he likely can't play the 3 at a high level due to lack of shot creation from the perimeter and questionable ability to consistently guard great perimeter players. He can't play the 5, and at the 4 he may not be a good enough shooter in this NBA. Not to mention we already have a 4 going forward who has the same positional limitations. If he does fall to us and the other players are off the board, his potential is simply too high to overlook him at this point. 

**7. Wendell Carter Jr.**- Carter imo has been one of the more underrated prospects in the draft. He's the most well rounded center in the draft. Offensively, he can post up, face up, space the floor from 3 at a decent level for a center, he's a good finisher around the rim, and he's an effective roll man. His most intriguing offensive feature is his passing ability, hes the best big man passer in the draft, this opens up a lot of possibilities with our roster, as we would have 5 shooters on the floor, and a center who can create for others, leaving the lane wide open for cuts, and plenty of off-ball movement towards the rim. Defensively, hes a solid rebounder, has the strength and build to guard stronger centers and is long enough and has good instincts to be a solid rim protector. His main downsides are related to athleticism, he's not a great athlete and can't play above the rim much which puts a cap on his potential as a player on both ends of the floor. 

**8. Mikal Bridges**- The best 3 and D prospect in the draft with elite perimeter shooting skills, elite perimeter defense and the defensive versatility to guard positions 1-4 and interrupt passing lanes. He's good at attacking closeouts when defenders overplay him as a shooter and can finish at the rim well. He's incredibly efficient, and plays within the offensive. On the other hand, he's not a good shot creator, his handle has a ways to go and his scoring has not been very multifaceted. He excels as a spot up shooter and got a lot of shots in transition, but didn't score in many other ways. His offensive versatility is what arguably makes him a higher floor lower ceiling prospect.

**9. Trae Young**- One of the best offensive guards in the NCAA this year. He's a great passer and runs the pick and roll well which bodes well for an NBA career. His shooting vaults his upside into an elite category, he can pull up from anywhere, come off screens to knock down shots and has a good floater game going to the rim. He's also a fantastic and crafty ball handler which could offset his lack of size and burst. On the other hand, he struggles mightily defensively, he's undersized and doesn't have the ability to stay with good offensive players, he'll have to be hidden on that end of the floor for his career. Outside of a floater, hes not a great finisher and relied a lot on drawing fouls to rack up points. His overall size, physical tools and decision making make him a very very high risk player, but at this point in the draft if the other 8 players are off the board, he's who I take just for the upside. 

**10. Miles Bridges**- Bridges projects as a good role player with interesting upside. Offensively, he's incredibly athletic and has a lot of burst and explosiveness that allows him to finish around the rim well. He's also a good shooter and can knock down shots from the perimeter at a decent clip. He's incredibly crafty attacking closeouts and this allows him to get to the rim despite good ball handling. On the other hand, he does struggle with ball handling and shot creation which limits his potential, he's not an elite shooter, and often settles for midrange jumpshots instead of consistently driving all the way to the rim. He's not a great passer and his defensive hasn't been anything impressive. 

**Prospect Matchups**

**Doncic vs Ayton**- For me this matchup came down to upside, given Ayton's physical tools and all around potential, he just seems like a safer and more high upside pick at the number 1 spot than Doncic does. I can see both players being All-NBA level players but with Ayton it seems more likely with his talent than Doncic who could fizzle out as a great floor general but not a talented scoring threat.

**Bamba vs. JJJ**- Both highly rated prospects for their defense, and that was the basis of my decision. I think JJJ has shown a much more innate feel for the game in terms of defensive timing and intensity. Bamba has great potential on that end due to his wingspan, but JJJ averaged more blocks per 40 mins than Bamba and is the safer pick imo whereas Bamba's defensive instincts and intensity in the post make him a riskier pick.

**Carter vs. Mikal**- I understand the allure of taking a 3 and D player as soon as that group of elite 6 prospects is off the board, however, I think Carter is the higher ceiling player. I worry about Mikal's versatility offensively and to me he projects very much like an Otto Porter type player that doesn't quite have the shot creation or ball handling to be more than a roleplayer. Carter has shown more versatility but was held back by Bagley's dominance. He has a decent shot for a center, has a post up/face up game and projects as a good rim protector. I also think the value of a passing big man is highly underrated. Big men who can create such as Jokic/Horford open up lanes to the rim that allow for all sorts of interesting actions and techniques to exploit defenses. ","My 2018 Draft Board and Top 10 Prospect Analysis These are the top 10 players on my draft board that I would have if I were in the Bulls front office. I did an analysis (not a ranking) piece already on the players we could take with the [pels pick](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/89nwir/a_look_at_some_of_the_prospects_we_can_take_with/?ref=share&ref_source=link), since draft odds have been finalized I thought I would now do one for the top prospects along with a ranking element. I realize that a key piece of these rankings is addressing specific reasons why I chose a certain player over the other, so at the end of the post, I've addressed specific matchups that I thought might be more questionable/arguable. I just want to stress, that these are just my opinions, I'm not an expert in any sense, I'm just a fan.

**1. Deandre Ayton**- Ayton has all the tools and indications that he could be an All-NBA level player. On offensive, he has an excellent post up game and can finish around the rim incredibly well. He has a decent shot that will can get him an elite Joel Embiid type face up game, and will allow him to stretch the floor. He can pass out of the post when pressured by defenses. He has excellent athleticism and speed for a center and can be a nightmare in transition for other teams to guard. Defensively, it's been very clear that he's had issues. He simply wasn't a great rim protector in college despite having all the physical tools to be one and just in terms of bball iq he didn't seem to have a good feel for defensive instincts such as when to help and how to shut down players who attack the rim. On the other hand, he's an excellent rebounder, and he has the speed and agility to switch onto smaller players and hold his own. The tools to be a great rim protector are there, with the proper guidance he could become a prototypical elite defensive big in the league with the ability to shut down dribble penetration and switch pick and rolls to guard smaller players, this is however a big if. Overall, his potential and all around game is too good to pass up, if the Bulls end up with number 1 pick, I take would take Ayton. 

**2. Luka Doncic**- Can realistically play positions 1-3. Hes a transcendent playmaker who runs the pick and roll incredibly well and makes the right basketball play more often than not. For a 6'8"" guy hes a fantastic ball handler, so while he lacks elite burst his craftiness and ball handling help him get to the rim, where he can finish incredibly well with a variety of moves. He projects as a good shooter, hes a good free throw shooter, can pull up from 3, step back, or make defenders pay for going under screens although his shooting percentages from outside have drawn some concerns. On the other hand, the questions about his athleticism and speed are legitimate, there is a concern that those factors could keep him from living up to the expectations of a top 2 pick and put a cap on his potential. This also limits him defensively as hes sometimes unable to stay with faster more explosive players, although in general I think knocks against his defense have him overstated. Overall, his incredible playmaking ability, craftiness, and overall maturity gives him a high ceiling and he comes into the NBA with a high floor as well having played professionally for years.

**3. Jaren Jackson Jr.**- Arguably the best defensive big in the NCAA this year. JJJ has incredible feel for the game on the defensive end and knows just when to help, how to angle his body and long arms to block and alter shots. He's also incredibly effective for a center when switched onto guards and wings. Like with a lot of bigs, defensives won't be able to punish him by forcing switches, he has the agility to stay with faster players and the timing to still alter shots from behind if does get beat. He also has the ability to shoot the ball decently from 3, which makes him a threat in pick and pop situations and paired with markkanen opens up the lane for all sorts of hoiball possibilities. The downside is that offensively, theres not much else hes great at. Hes an ok finisher around the rim, his shot creates the potential for a face up game although his body and skill has not caught up. He can be a good rim runner and pick and roll guy but not much else. It will take a while for him to develop offensively. His defensive abilities and the potential to anchor an elite defensive in the NBA put him at the 3 spot for me. 

**4. Mo Bamba**- Bamba would have the largest wingspan in the NBA day one and this is primarily where his potential lies. Bamba has shown at the college level, albeit not as amazingly as expected but still incredibly well, the ability to be a perennial DPOY candidate with his rim protection. He also does other things well, such as pass out of the post, finish around the rim out of pick and rolls, and spacing the floor with a still in progress jumpshot that looks like it could translate to the NBA. He has the agility and quickness to stick with smaller and faster players when forced to switch. On the other hand, there are some factors that create some bust potential here. He isn't a fantastic rebounder for his size, he lacks the strength and toughness down low to battle bigger stronger centers, and his post up game is a work in progress which makes his offensive upside suspect.

He's has great athleticism for his size and has the agility and length to be a great perimeter defender. On the other hand, the back injury is a major concern, its questionable how much of the poor return from injury was just rust and how much was health related, and whether it will be a long term issue going forward. Offensively, he lacks the craftiness from a ball handling perspective to get to the rim in half court offense consistently and settles for jumpers way too often in these situations leading to inefficient and ill-advised shots. His ability to be a great defender so far has also been theoretical, his physical tools have not translated to good defense. Overall, Porter has incredible upside, but he also has some of the biggest questions about his game and health.

**6. Marvin Bagley III**- Incredible athleticism, matched with incredible speed for a big man. Offensively, he has incredible upside, he can handle the ball in the open court, he can finish around the rim, he can post up, face up, can be a lethal roll man, has great speed in transition which makes him incredibly dangerous in those situations.

"I know we have a chance to land De Andre by striking big in lottery odds. But what if we are stuck at 6th and Cavs 25th pick \(via LAL\) is available for Luol Deng, would you trade Bulls #6, Pels #22 and Cavs 25th pick for De Andre Ayton?

I love Luol and he would fit the team, given we draft Ayton and we need a SF. Aside from that, him mentoring this young team is something he does well. Though a bit slower, he still play defense too.

We owe felicio ~ 24 million over the next 3 years. So we can just get all that done in 1 year plus an extra 1st in this draft or maybe next years draft. Both drafts are loaded with talent.

"What do you guys think of Jabari Parker as a free agent target this offseason? He brings a lot of positives with a couple of negatives (what player doesn't?).

On the positive side of things, he is young, having just turned 23, can play either the small ball 4 or small forward position. That positional flexibility is super helpful as it means that the Bulls could target a wing (MPJ, Mikal or Miles Bridges) or a center (Mo Bamba, Wendell Carter, Jr.) without really worrying about how Parker would fit the roster. Jabari has improved as a 3-point shooter over his short career, hitting 38.1% from behind the arc in 31 games this season. He also attacks the rim and is a pretty good rebounder and decent distributor. With his injury history (2 ACL tears in the past 3 seasons), he would be an affordable option that can fit the Bulls's cap space. Also, he is a Chicago guy, having attended Simeon High School.

On the downside, see the above note about 2 ACL tears in the past 3 seasons. There were encouraging signs of his play this year after returning from the most recent ACL injury but it remains to be seen if he can be that 20 pts/6 reb/3 ast player he was in 2016-17. If the Bulls do get Parker and draft Michael Porter, Jr., that would force Lauri to the center position. That could be a good or a bad thing as I, for one, am not quite sure where Lauri fits long-term yet.

"Hello Bulls fans, as a die hard basketball fan who grew up in Istanbul, I want to share my thoughts with you about some european players and bball and discuss our Bulls’ future. 

Before I start, I would like to tell about my background a bit. Football(soccer) is like a religion in turkey and you have to support a club. Same clubs have many teams in different sports, which causes so much debt so, many teams are unable to grow and can’t be succeeded. I am a Galatasaray fan, basically the biggest football club but a normal european bball club. I’ve always been into basketball but our rivals Fenerbahce are one of the biggest teams in Europe and last year Bogdanovic led them to Euroleague championship. As I’ve already said there is just no Draft and no way to grow and get succeeded like Fener and that always drove me crazy. One day my father bought a Bulls cap randomly, so i got curious about it and started searching, learning and watching NBA basketball with D Rose’s buzzer against the Cavs. That was the first time I watched a whole NBA game and I was full of thrill and excitement after the game. That guy D Rose became my favorite. His pokerface is still fresh in my mind. NBA was so different from turkish league. Faster, more clever and intelligent. Only bad thing was the lack of enthusiasm of the audience(which i still think so) and it got me more interested day by day to the NBA and since that day I am a Bulls fan.

First of all I would like to talk about some young prospects, which you all curious about. I have seen every Doncic game of this year in Euroleague and I can easily say that he has the tools to be a really good nba player. He hits some rare shots, has the vision and is a good scorer. He is somewhat cluth as well. He has good handles and has some ankle-breakers (you can watch them on yt) But besides the hype, hes feet are incredibly slow and has no footwork. Shortly he lacks athleticism, which is very important in todays nba. He is the leader of Madrid for sure but in playoffs he was not responding to that role until yesterday he scored 17. His potential to go crazy is the real deal but he is inconsistent and sometimes just throws unnecessary shots even in Euroleague. In my opinion he is overrated and i see his ceiling somwhat like MIP Turkoglu but he could be a multiple time all-star as well. *go MPJ!* We shouldn’t draft him IMO.

Cedi Osman is a hustler. He is a real gym rat and works his ass of all the time. When I saw him play for the first time three years  ago I thought he could be a all-star level player but he hasn’t got such tools to be a allstar tbh. Even though, he is a really good defender for todays nba even as a rookie bcs sometimes players just watch other instead of defending which makes me literally crazy and Cedi just never gives up. He is so energetic and if he can improve his jumpshot and ft I think he will be a really good 6th/7th man. I think he could average  10/12-4-4-2 for multiple years if he gets the opportunity. *go MPJ!*

Furkan Korkmaz is just 20 years old and has a long career ahead. When he signed with Philly I was so happy for him. I still think that his ceiling is higher than Cedi. IMO he can be a good starter for NBA if he works real hard. He really has to bulk up. This year he was really unlucky he was injured for 3 months and after that he lost his confidence. He always tried to prove himself which made him take bad decisions and be fussy because he was getting very little minutes. I see him averaging 13/14-3-3 for multiple years. But in a worst case scenario he comes back to turkey. (the gap is huge for him, he will be good or awful. but for cedi i think he can stay in the nba unlike furkan in a worst case scenario.) *MPJ!*

My season review for our Bulls is really optimistic. I’m not going to say that i am really happy with our 6th pick because after the run until Niko came back i really thought that we were going to the 1st. But i’m glad that we get 6, at some point even the fucking knicks were ahead of us and we were in the range of 8-10. Still we can win the lottery. A hope keeps a human alive. But if the lottery fucks us up and we get something like 8, we should trade up with the Bullicans pick. The importance of the 1st rounds are understood but the chance of drafting a starter/allstar is very slim with the Pels pick. I know we aint expecting that but we dont need more role players anymore, we have such good core and our bench made us get so many w’s this year so it would be more sensible and rational and we can draft another possible franchise player with 3-6. Getting good players is always a thing to be happy but the main thing is finding the core player. Lauri is going to be a really good player for sure but i dont think he can carry us to the finals as we expect. We need a Simmons/Embiid/Booker/Mitchell type of scorer, an elite nba player. Mpj is the great fit for that. but If we get the first we should go with Ayton. He really is a monster. 

My fav player of this year was Lauri. Not like other Bulls fans, i knew that he was gonna succeed bcs i watched him at euros and he was smooth and pure. He should bulk up and work on his post play. He is a shoot first player and i like that but he can kill players under the rim with his skills and athleticism. A stretch big is what we really needed and I’ve already missed him play ahaha. My expectations for next season: 18.4ppg 8.4rpg 2.2apg 1bpg. He has to block.

Dunn was one of my favs this year. He can be the leader of our team. Good hustler, good character, good player. I dont think he can be a all star. But after his rookie season he really proved me wrong. If he can add himself a reliable 3pt shot he can be deadly. He just need a above average 3pt like 35%. He is already an all defensive player. This summer is crucial for him to get a jumpshot. His athletic abilities are really good as well. 2 of my favorite plays of this year was his dunk on Olynyk and when he said Fuck him after a game winner hahah:). My expectations for next season: 14.5ppg 4.9rpg 7.7apg 2.4spg with 36% 3pt.

LaVine was my biggest disappointment of the season. Don’t get me wrong, he was not bad but his fg% according to his shot selection was really poor. Dude looked like he didnt know when to shoot. But he still showed some real talent after a big injury and we should give him a 16-19m contract  at max. His poster in sacramento was magical. My expectations for next season: 20ppg 3.8rpg 3.7apg with 45% fg.

Zel’s floaters are the real deal haha. He was really good this year I think. I liked his game and he will improve himself even more this year. He passes the ball very well unlike fucking Grant. He has to be our backup pg and he should work more on his assists.(passing) We need a veteran and Robez is perfect for that role. He is a good teammate and i really like him. Nwaba is a good hustler and if he gets a reliable 3pt he can be really effective and the last but not least I like Holiday.

If everything goes well, we draft MPJ, he becomes a really good nba player, we can be a championship contender in 4 or 5 years after the gsw dynasty. Next year I dont have big expectations and i dont think we will get a playoff spot. But the future is bright. Next year will be another improvement year. After than, beep beep!

ps: sorry for grammer mistakes, i reaaaally want to hear your opinions and discuss about our future. Have a nice day!

-----**Making Gains**------

-**Denzel Valentine (Age 24)**:



Year | MPG | PPG | RPG | APG | SPLITS FG/3P/FT
----|---|---|---|---|---------------
16-17 | 17.1 | 5.1 | 2.6 | 1.1 | 35.4/35.1/77.8%
17-18 | 27.2 | 10.2 | 5.1 | 3.2 | 41.7/38.6/74.5%



Pretty unremarkable first year with some hot scoring flashes, but the game seemed to slow down for him a LOT this year, along with development of his weirdly consistent floater. Played well at the PG the few times he had to aside from doing well at the 2 spot, but his numbers have jumped up nicely and you'd hope to continue to see improvement, particularly with working on his AST/TO ratio. (Note: Zel's TO's went from 0.9 to 1.3 while tripling his assist avg, which is great).

**-Kris Dunn (Age 24)**



Year | MPG | PPG | RPG | APG | SPLITS FG/3P/FT
----|---|---|---|---|---------------
16-17 | 17.1 | 3.8 | 2.1 | 2.4 | 37.7/28.8/61.0%
17-18 | 29.3 | 13.4 | 4.3 | 6.0 | 42.9/32.1/73.0%




Probably the most obvious ""big gainer"" over the offseason and during this regular season. He managed to work through most of his bad habits, developed a really nice mid-range shot and is gaining confidence with his 3PT shot. His defense has been top notch pretty much all year (minus a few foul trouble spots) and I expect him to round out his game this summer to maximize his versatility. Kris also went from 1 TO and 1 STL per game in 16-17 to 2.9 TO and 2 STL per game this season. Taking care of the ball will be a priority.)

**-Bobby Portis (Age 23)**



Year | MPG | PPG | RPG | APG | SPLITS FG/3P/FT
----|---|---|---|---|---------------
15-16 | 17.8 | 7.0 | 5.4 | 0.8 | 42.7/30.8/72.7%
16-17 | 15.6 | 6.8 | 4.6 | 0.5 | 48.8/33.3/66.1%
17-18 | 22.5 | 13.2 | 6.8 | 1.7 | 47.1/35.9/76.9%

God, I love Bobby. He brings energy and intensity every night while still being under control. His 3Pt shot is steadily improving and he's a beast on the boards. It's great to see his assists going up with his increase in minutes even though he's become the first option on the second unit. I trust Bobby's work ethic to work his ass off this summer and get that 3Pt percentage even higher and throw some extra post moves to make him a real headache. 

**-David Nwaba (Age 25)**



Year | MPG | PPG | RPG | APG | SPLITS FG/3P/FT | GP
----|---|---|---|---|---------------|--
16-17 | 20.0 | 6.0 | 3.2 | 0.7 | 58.0/20.0/64.1% | 20
17-18 | 23.5 | 7.9 | 4.7 | 1.5 | 47.8/34.6/65.5% | 70

I included ""Games Played"" into this table to avoid any sample size confusion. Obviously a lot of what David brings to the court doesn't show up on the stat sheet, but he's an unbelievably athletic dude who works his ass off. He loves driving the baseline and later in the season started looking more comfortable pulling up. With his athleticism/speed, if he can develop any type of reliable jumpshot (mid-range or 3Pt) he's going to be a nuisance for anyone to guard. 

**-Cam Payne (Age 23)**


Year | MPG | PPG | RPG | APG | SPLITS FG/3P/FT | GP
----|---|---|---|---|---------------|--
16-17 | 14.9 | 4.9 | 1.5 | 1.4 | 33.3/32.4/25.0% | 25
17-18 | 23.3 | 8.8 | 2.8 | 4.5 | 40.5/38.5/75.0% | 31

So, I think we all expected Cam to come back and look worse than he did.. but all in all he had a pretty good end to the season. I honestly think it's still too early to decide one way or the other on Cam, but it least wasn't a total regression or stagnation. Speaking of which...




**-----Regression and Stagnation Station-----**

**-Paul Zipser (Age 24)**



Year | MPG | PPG | RPG | APG | SPLITS FG/3P/FT
----|---|---|---|---|---------------
16-17 | 19.2 | 5.5 | 2.4 | 0.8 | 39.8/33.3/77.5%
17-18 | 15.3 | 4.0 | 2.4 | 0.9 | 34.6/33.6/76.0%

Zip stayed just about the same on everything while managing to look a lot worse. I'm not sure what the culprit is to his lack of improvement in any facet of his game, but he looks more and more like a lost cause every day.


**-Jerian Grant (Age 25)**


Year | MPG | PPG | RPG | APG | SPLITS FG/3P/FT
----|---|---|---|---|---------------
15-16  | 16.6 | 5.6 | 1.9 | 2.3 | 39.4/22.0/78.0%
16-17 | 16.3 | 5.9 | 1.8 | 1.9 | 42.5/36.6/89.0%
17-18 | 22.8 | 8.4 | 2.3 | 4.6 | 41.6/32.6/74.5%

Grant was one of the reasons this season felt so long. His assist numbers have come up a bit along with his minutes, but especially considering how much time he was given to show improvement over the course of the season (See: Kris Dunn) I feel like Jerian isn't a serviceable 2nd unit PG. The only thing I could see trying out is throwing Grant at the 2 on the second unit, but I'm not convinced of that either since that will most likely where Denzel finds a home. 

**-Cristiano Felicio (Age 25)**


Year | MPG | PPG | RPG | APG | SPLITS FG/3P/FT
----|---|---|---|---|---------------
15-16 | 10.3 | 3.4 | 3.3 | 0.8 | 55.6/none/71.4%
16-17 | 15.8 | 4.8 | 4.7 | 0.6 | 57.9/none/64.5%
17-18 | 17.8 | 5.6 | 4.2 | 1.0 | 59.1/none/66.7%

Looking like he's gonna take the money and run, Felicio showed basically zero improvement the entire year, save for maybe a few nice moments late in the season. If I'm forced to say something nice... I guess he at least knows enough not to shoot 3's?

","Statistical analysis of current Bulls players' improvement over the last few years After the post the other day about which Bulls players were going to improve the most in the offseason it prompted me to put together some basic stats of the Bulls younger core and see who has already improved and where.

Year | MPG | PPG | RPG | APG | SPLITS FG/3P/FT
----|---|---|---|---|---------------
16-17 | 17.1 | 5.1 | 2.6 | 1.1 | 35.4/35.1/77.8%
17-18 | 27.2 | 10.2 | 5.1 | 3.2 | 41.7/38.6/74.5%



Pretty unremarkable first year with some hot scoring flashes, but the game seemed to slow down for him a LOT this year, along with development of his weirdly consistent floater. Played well at the PG the few times he had to aside from doing well at the 2 spot, but his numbers have jumped up nicely and you'd hope to continue to see improvement, particularly with working on his AST/TO ratio. (Note: Zel's TO's went from 0.9 to 1.3 while tripling his assist avg, which is great).

**-Kris Dunn (Age 24)**



Year | MPG | PPG | RPG | APG | SPLITS FG/3P/FT
----|---|---|---|---|---------------
16-17 | 17.1 | 3.8 | 2.1 | 2.4 | 37.7/28.8/61.0%
17-18 | 29.3 | 13.4 | 4.3 | 6.0 | 42.9/32.1/73.0%




Probably the most obvious ""big gainer"" over the offseason and during this regular season. He managed to work through most of his bad habits, developed a really nice mid-range shot and is gaining confidence with his 3PT shot. His defense has been top notch pretty much all year (minus a few foul trouble spots) and I expect him to round out his game this summer to maximize his versatility. Kris also went from 1 TO and 1 STL per game in 16-17 to 2.9 TO and 2 STL per game this season. Taking care of the ball will be a priority.)

**-Bobby Portis (Age 23)**



Year | MPG | PPG | RPG | APG | SPLITS FG/3P/FT
----|---|---|---|---|---------------
15-16 | 17.8 | 7.0 | 5.4 | 0.8 | 42.7/30.8/72.7%
16-17 | 15.6 | 6.8 | 4.6 | 0.5 | 48.8/33.3/66.1%
17-18 | 22.5 | 13.2 | 6.8 | 1.7 | 47.1/35.9/76.9%

God, I love Bobby. He brings energy and intensity every night while still being under control. His 3Pt shot is steadily improving and he's a beast on the boards. It's great to see his assists going up with his increase in minutes even though he's become the first option on the second unit. I trust Bobby's work ethic to work his ass off this summer and get that 3Pt percentage even higher and throw some extra post moves to make him a real headache. 

**-David Nwaba (Age 25)**



Year | MPG | PPG | RPG | APG | SPLITS FG/3P/FT | GP
----|---|---|---|---|---------------|--
16-17 | 20.0 | 6.0 | 3.2 | 0.7 | 58.0/20.0/64.1% | 20
17-18 | 23.5 | 7.9 | 4.7 | 1.5 | 47.8/34.6/65.5% | 70

I included ""Games Played"" into this table to avoid any sample size confusion. Obviously a lot of what David brings to the court doesn't show up on the stat sheet, but he's an unbelievably athletic dude who works his ass off. He loves driving the baseline and later in the season started looking more comfortable pulling up. With his athleticism/speed, if he can develop any type of reliable jumpshot (mid-range or 3Pt) he's going to be a nuisance for anyone to guard. 

**-Cam Payne (Age 23)**


Year | MPG | PPG | RPG | APG | SPLITS FG/3P/FT | GP
----|---|---|---|---|---------------|--
16-17 | 14.9 | 4.9 | 1.5 | 1.4 | 33.3/32.4/25.0% | 25
17-18 | 23.3 | 8.8 | 2.8 | 4.5 | 40.5/38.5/75.0% | 31

So, I think we all expected Cam to come back and look worse than he did.. but all in all he had a pretty good end to the season. I honestly think it's still too early to decide one way or the other on Cam, but it least wasn't a total regression or stagnation. Speaking of which...




**-----Regression and Stagnation Station-----**

**-Paul Zipser (Age 24)**



Year | MPG | PPG | RPG | APG | SPLITS FG/3P/FT
----|---|---|---|---|---------------
16-17 | 19.2 | 5.5 | 2.4 | 0.8 | 39.8/33.3/77.5%
17-18 | 15.3 | 4.0 | 2.4 | 0.9 | 34.6/33.6/76.0%

Zip stayed just about the same on everything while managing to look a lot worse. I'm not sure what the culprit is to his lack of improvement in any facet of his game, but he looks more and more like a lost cause every day.


**-Jerian Grant (Age 25)**


Year | MPG | PPG | RPG | APG | SPLITS FG/3P/FT
----|---|---|---|---|---------------
15-16  | 16.6 | 5.6 | 1.9 | 2.3 | 39.4/22.0/78.0%
16-17 | 16.3 | 5.9 | 1.8 | 1.9 | 42.5/36.6/89.0%
17-18 | 22.8 | 8.4 | 2.3 | 4.6 | 41.6/32.6/74.5%

Grant was one of the reasons this season felt so long. His assist numbers have come up a bit along with his minutes, but especially considering how much time he was given to show improvement over the course of the season (See: Kris Dunn) I feel like Jerian isn't a serviceable 2nd unit PG. The only thing I could see trying out is throwing Grant at the 2 on the second unit, but I'm not convinced of that either since that will most likely where Denzel finds a home. 

**-Cristiano Felicio (Age 25)**


Year | MPG | PPG | RPG | APG | SPLITS FG/3P/FT
----|---|---|---|---|---------------
15-16 | 10.3 | 3.4 | 3.3 | 0.8 | 55.6/none/71.4%
16-17 | 15.8 | 4.8 | 4.7 | 0.6 | 57.9/none/64.5%
17-18 | 17.8 | 5.6 | 4.2 | 1.0 | 59.1/none/66.7%

Looking like he's gonna take the money and run, Felicio showed basically zero improvement the entire year, save for maybe a few nice moments late in the season. If I'm forced to say something nice... I guess he at least knows enough not to shoot 3's?

"**Lauri Markkanen**- I am so incredibly excited about lauri going forward. His potential is incredible and I really think we have a future all star in him. This summer he obviously needs to put on weight, and i think this is gonna open up so many opportunities for him, he'll be a more effective driver as he can finish through contact more easily and won't get cut off by defenders as much. He'll be able to face up and post up and hit that turnaround jumper more as he wont get bodied when receiving the ball in the post, im really excited to see what he does next season. 

*Some coaching notes for hoiberg for markkanen*: he needs more opportunities to handle the ball in the open court. His handle is not good enough to break down defenders on the perimeter, but he has looked downright scary when handling in transition ie. the kanter dunk, or this nifty sequence against the pacers (https://youtu.be/ET94RDrjqw0?t=29s). I also think he needs to be played like a guard off the ball more. Most of his 3 point opportunities have come from pick and pop, I think if they run off ball screens for him like a klay thompson, that could produce some really interesting results especially given how good he is at attacking closeouts and this could produce some more committed closeouts which are easier to attack. 

**Kris Dunn**- I think Dunn's ceiling is a fringe all star which isn't bad if we buy into markkanen and lavine being go to options on this team. I really liked his ability to pass and just keep the ball moving and push the tempo in transition. In that sense he fits hoiberg's offense fairly well although in every other way, there are issues. His handle has also looked really solid, and if he makes a commitment to get to the rim more, he can definitely do that. It was also nice seeing his shot improve, although as the season went on, it kind of regressed. In that sense, his scoring style is not advantageous to hoiberg's style. He takes too many midrange shots and doesnt convert them at a high enough clip for it to efficient, he cant finish at the rim well, and the shot is still developing. Pax pretty much hit the nail on the head in terms of what he needs to improve this summer, finishing, and shooting. If he does that, and becomes less erratic in clutch situations, we have a great pg going forward, if not, he may not fit what we're trying to accomplish on this team.

**Zach Lavine**- Lavine was a huge question mark this season. First of all, for fans who think he could end up somewhere else this season, i very highly doubt that, if i had to guess, i think garpax pay him the max if they have to. Going into his game, it was not all that great as he shot below 40% from the field, and sometimes looked like he couldn't buy a bucket. He also struggled a lot with off-ball defense and straight up looked lost on that end sometimes. That said at times, he showed incredible shotmaking ability, solid finishing ability, and even good on ball defense. If the bad overall shooting was a result of recovery from the acl injury, then sure he looks like he could have all star potential. If not, he really worries me going forward, on both ends of the floor. I also think we're running into a butler situation here, at times lavine straight up threw out the gameplan and just jacked up bad shot after bad shot, i really think if hes not willing to buy in to the gameplan and hoiberg isn't ready to give him some tough love, we are in for more conflict here. Overall, lavine is kind of what we expected, all the upside is still there, the athleticism, quickness, smooth shooting stroke. What isnt there is the defense and the willingness to play within the flow of the offense. 

*For coaching notes*: More tough love, make him play within the offense. Get him off the ball more, he looks great in catch and shoot situations, and getting him a head of steam going to the basket before receiving the ball could be really beneficial. 

**Bobby Portis**- He's really starting to look like a keeper as a sparkplug off the bench. He's developed every aspect of his game, his 3 point shot is getting better, hes become a really solid post player. He won't ever be a rim protector but it seems like he can play decent one on one defense against NBA bigs and brings intensity every game. 

**Fred Hoiberg**- We've finally got to see what Hoiberg can do with an roster built for his offense. The results have definitely been impressive, he looks like a solid coach from an X's and O's perspective, if he lets jim boylen do his job on the defensive end, we could be in a solid coaching situation going forward. That said, the issues with assertiveness and getting players to buy in seems to still be there. He hasn't done much about lavine's trigger happy style of play and him and dunn sometimes taking over games for themselves. I figured with young players, he could get them to buy in before they became stars so that commitment to his plan is there in the future, but some players already seem to have their own idea of what they want to be. I don't know what the solution to the problem is and whether its damning enough for us to question fred as our coach going forward. We'll know more next season when everyone gets enough games and reps i suppose. ","My end of season notes/opinions **Lauri Markkanen**- I am so incredibly excited about lauri going forward.

"This season has been a hell of an emotional rollercoaster. The tank looked like it was on its last wheels several times, every win streak infuriating the fanbase more and more. When all hope was seemingly gone a few teams and players came to the aid of our dying tank. We will never forget the debts and services of said men. This is a post honoring these brave allies. 

First Team Tank Allies:
• Bogdan Bogdanovic - Bogdan, aka Serbian Klay Thompson, contributed multiple game winners to the kings season. Him and Fox easily won the Kings four or five late season games by themselves, destroying their chances at getting a top five pick. Bogdan slander is now forbidden on our sub

•De’aaron Fox- Somehow managed to be even more clutch then Bogdanovic. Fox routinely  bailed out needless Bulls victories by hitting insane game winners for the Kings.  Without Fox, the bulls aren’t picking sixth and likely missing out on the”Star” prospects. 

•Allen Crabbe - Dude showed the hell up for his B-Day match against us, the same game Sean Kilpatrick was trying to kill the tank . Crabbe knew how essential those Nets loses were for the Bulls and decided to put up a career high. It was his birthday, he’ll kill the Cavs draft pick if he wants too.

•Entire staff of the Houston Rockets -  The title favorites couldn’t have rested their stars at a better time this season. They managed to do the Bulls job for them and outtank the Kings, finalizing the tie for the sixth pick.  Being one of the luckiest outcomes this season, I feel it’s fair to root for them to go deep in the playoffs 
 
Edit: •Lauri’s Baby - If the Helsinki edition of teen mom didn’t happen, the Bulls would for sure be picking somewhere between 8 and 10.  Maybe the kid is named “Tank.”","Allies of The tank This season has been a hell of an emotional rollercoaster.

&nbsp;

He just declared yesterday, he's 6'10"" ~260lbs and a 7'3"" wingspan.

&nbsp;

He can shoot the three decently, really good interior defense, good mid-range, and really nice footwork. Also, he has an insane IQ, shows he can be coached, and has a ton of motivation and crazy heart/competitiveness.

&nbsp;

The only thing I can see as a downfall is he's not the fastest guy on the court and could work on his passing but he showed very nice glimpses at Duke.

&nbsp;

If it wasn't for Bagley reclassifying to Duke, I believe Wendell Carter Jr. could've made a case for a top-4 pick. Even WITH Bagley he still averaged 14 pts and 9 rebs. Easily could've eclipsed the 20pt, 10reb without Bagley.

I know trading future picks is extremely unpopular for rebuilding teams, but...

"I took a look at the cap situation for next season and noticed that we only have about $36 million in roster salary for 2019-2020.

Remaining cap space: $55,011,189


We don't exactly know Lavine's contract extension so I obviously assumed it, not sure if I low balled or went too high? We can hold off signing Bobby and Cam until after free agency since we have their bird rights. We'll probably let go of Zip, Grant, and let Rolo and Holiday walk which means we'll have around $56,687,924 of cap space for free agency. Not only is this enough for 2 max contracts, but everyone on the roster would be theoretically hitting their primes.

"Few weeks ago I posted this idea of eliminating the incentive for tanking to /r/nba, but didn't get too many comments on the post (most of the comments were about my mental health...). So as a bulls fan, after cheering Markkanen to win and Bulls to lose, I thought I'd ask this sub's opinion.

The idea is simple. What if no team would be allowed to keep its own draft pick? Teams would be forced to switch or trade away their picks. If you were left with your own pick, you'd pick last. Would teams have to make their moves before the season starts or the end of trade deadline, I don't know.

Most likely you'd get about same level teams switching picks with each other, but no tanking anymore. Well, not at the same rate as today anyways. There might be some cases where tanking would still be beneficial (for getting more desirable first round play off opponent or making some team to pass the team whose pick you own).

What do you think (...about my mental health)?

"Last game of the season, draft position on the line, and the Bulls once again came up clutch to lose big to the Pistons. That solidified the 7th lottery spot for us, but then the Kings were able to beat the Rockets to give us the best draft position we could have possibly finished with going into the night. The Bulls will finish the season tied for 6th in the lottery standings, with almost double the odds for a top 3 pick than we had coming out of the all-star break. The Pelicans prevented it from being an absolutely perfect night by winning their game and entering a 4 way tie for the 20-23 picks. It sucks a bit, but there's no way I could be upset with last night with how well things went for our first pick.

&nbsp;

No more games this season so this will be the last tank watch post. I loved writing these every day and reading all the comments that were written. Having /r/chicagobulls  band together to cheer for the tank turned what could have been a really rough season into a really fun experience. I'm expecting a much more competitive Bulls team after the offseason, so I don't expect we'll be cheering for a tank again next season. Let's hope for some luck in the lottery, a really promising draft pick or two, and come back next season with a winning team! It's been an honor tanking with you all.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

**2 games good for tank; 0 games bad for the tank**

**1 game good for Pelicans pick; 1 game bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Nets (28-54) 97

Celtics(55-27) 110

If we had won our game, this would have been bad for the tank, tying us with the Nets for 7th. Luckily, we lost so this game had no bearing on our draft picks. 

**Doesn't end up affecting tank**

&nbsp;

Knicks (29-53) 110

Cavaliers(50-32) 98

Same as the Nets, this game didn't end up affecting us since we lost our game. Cavaliers starters (except Osman) only played for 10 minutes each, so the Knicks took a 2nd quarter lead against the Cavs bench that they never gave back. Really sucks for the Knicks who fall behind the Nets here to finish in sole possession of 9th.

**Doesn't end up affecting tank**

&nbsp;

Raptors(59-23) 109

Heat (44-38) 116

This one had no affect on our picks. Heat are able to beat the Raptors to avoid playing them in the first round of the playoffs. They will instead be playing the red hot 76ers though. 

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

Wizards(43-39) 92

Magic (25-57) 101

Another game that didn't affect the Bulls at all. Wizards just needed a win to play the injured Celtics team, but are once again unable to beat a tank. They fall into the 8th seed in the East and will play the Raptors because of it. Magic get a really rough win for them, putting them in 5th place in the lottery standings instead of tied for 3rd. Just an all around bad night for both teams.

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

Bucks (44-38) 95

76ers (52-30) 130

76ers pounded the Bucks early, finishing the first half with 80 points. They end the season on a 16 games winning streak and the 3 seed. They will play the Heat, while the Bucks will finish with the 7 seed and go against the Celtics.

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

Pistons(39-43) 119

Bulls (27-55) 87

No Griffin, no Drummond, no problem. Even without their best players, the Pistons were able to go on a really nice run early and then never gave up the lead. Tolliver went on a tear in the first quarter and then Kennard, Moreland, and others kept it going. The loss was a wonderful one for the Bulls who were able to move into a tie for the 6th lottery spot because of it. We now have a much more real chance of winning the lottery, and still a better pick if the lottery fails. Going into the last 3 games I wasn't even sure if we would finish tied for 8th. But with some clutch losses and a bit of help from the other tanks (especially Nets, love you guys) we were able to tie for that 6th spot.

Lauri had yet another great game, scoring 20 points on his usual shortened minutes. Outside of Lauri we just shot very poorly in this one, and never really threatened because of it. It'll be interesting to see what players from this lineup will still be on the team after this offseason. 

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Nuggets(46-36) 106

Wolves (47-35) 112

The Pelicans won, so neither of these teams ended up catching them for the Bulls. What a game though, Timberwolves ahead by between 1-10 for pretty much the whole game before the Nuggets send it to overtime, and then the Wolves able to pull out the win in the end. Jimmy was amazing as usual with a team leading 31 points. I'm really happy for Jimmy, Taj and the Wolves, but also sad for the Nuggets. They were a really good team this year and won 6 straight games just to force this one-game playoff. Jokic had 35 points to lead the Nuggets but it wasn't enough as they miss the playoffs again.

**Doesn't end up affecting Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Spurs (47-35) 98

Pelicans(48-34) 122

Spurs kept it close for a while, but by halftime the Pelicans had taken the game. Davis didn't even have the best night, but pretty much every single other player on the Pelicans shot over 50%. This win moves the Pelicans over the Spurs and Timberwolves and tied with the Pacers, Jazz, and Thunder in playoff record. This means that instead of a coin flip for 18-19th, the Pelicans will be getting a coin flip for 20-23rd. This isn't the best outcome, but we'll have to see what's available here once draft day comes.

**Bad for Pelicans pick x2**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (22-60) 123

Thunder (48-34) 137

Thunder are able to at least tie the Pelicans to end the season. If they had lost this game, the Pelicans pick tiebreaker would have been for 21-23rd pick, but we have a slightly better situation with a 4 way tie for 20-23rd instead.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Lakers (35-47) 115

Clippers(42-40) 100

This was a meaningless game both for the Bulls and for both teams involved.

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

Jazz (48-34) 93

Blazers(49-33) 102

Unfortunately the Pelicans won and were able to catch the Jazz in record. The Trail Blazers stay ahead and lock up the 3 seed in the playoffs and will now be playing the Pelicans in the first round. Jazz will finish tied with the Pelicans so we will have to hope for the best tiebreaker results tomorrow.

**Neutral for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Rockets(65-17) 83

Kings (27-55) 96

What an amazing game for the Bulls. Rockets pulled almost all of their good players so it was actually a pretty easy win for the Kings. After the Bulls loss I didn't want to get too hopeful, but the Kings just kept playing well all game and then put it pretty much out of hand in the 3rd. This gives us an even better chance when the lottery rolls around, and gives us a 50/50 shot at the 6th pick if that doesn't work out.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Future events affecting our picks** 

&nbsp;

* April 13th (tomorrow) there will be coin flip tiebreakers to decide draft order for teams that finished with the same regular season record. Bulls are tied with the Kings and will split the combined 6th and 7th place lottery chances evenly (unless its an odd number, then the coin flip decides who gets that 1 extra lottery chance). The tiebreaker will decide who gets the 6th pick if both teams do not win the lottery. Pelicans are in a 4 way tie with the Thunder, Pacers, and Jazz. The tiebreaker will decide who gets the 20-23rd picks. 

&nbsp;

* ~~April 14th the playoffs start. Playoff results don't affect the draft order except one exception: The NBA champs pick last. Cheer for whoever you want in the playoffs, but for the Bulls we cannot have the Pelicans winning the whole thing.~~

~~Edit: Thinking about it more, there actually are other ways that the playoffs could help our draft pick. If a team below the Pelicans were to win the finals, that team would move down to last pick, and move the Pelicans up 1 spot. So teams that would help the Bulls by winning would be the Wizards, Bucks, Heat, Timberwolves, Spurs, and then to a slightly lesser extent the Pacers, Jazz, and Thunder. So if one of these teams are able to make a run, let's be rooting for them in the finals.~~

******Ignore everything above with the playoff stuff, it's all wrong. The NBA finals champ does not pick last, it is still based on regular season record no matter who wins. Apologies for spreading wrong information, I must have gotten some bad info myself when I was looking up the draft details a while ago.

&nbsp;

* May 15th is the NBA Lottery. Our odds for a top 3 pick are 18.3% with our odds for the top pick at 5.3% (according to tankathon). It will be happening in Chicago so at least we'll have the home court advantage.

* June 21st is the NBA Draft. It's the day we finally get to see what our reward was for tanking the whole year. I know we all have very strong opinions when it comes to the top prospects (very much including me), but let's all remember that whoever we get is going to be a top ten talent that will likely be a big part of the Bulls for years to come.

"Last day of the season today, and still a good amount that can move around when it comes to our draft picks. Most important of all today, the Bulls need to finish with a loss to the Pistons. Winning would likely tie the Knicks and Nets and significantly hurt our lottery chances and possibly move our pick back to 8 or 9. After all of our tanking this year, we have to finish strong today. We could possibly tie the Kings for 6th, but they would have to beat the Rockets for that to happen.

As far as the Pelicans pick, we are mostly going to need them to lose to the Spurs. That would put them in the 8th seed and likely tied for the 18th pick. In case they win, we're going to also need the Thunder to win their game too. Tomorrow I'll wrap up the games happening today and that will be the last tank watch of the season. Let's hope by then we're all celebrating the results of today.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

**0 games good for tank; 0 games bad for the tank**

**1 game good for Pelicans pick; 1 game bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Hornets(35-46) 119

Pacers (48-33) 93

Pacers could have clinched a better record than the Pelicans with a win here, but now the Pels could tie them with a win today. This is bad because now the Pelicans pick can be as late as 23, when a win here would have kept it at 22 at worst.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

76ers (50-30) 121

Hawks(24-57) 113

76ers keep rolling and the Hawks stay tied for the 3rd lottery spot, good night for both teams.

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

Celtics (54-26) 101

Wizards(42-38) 113

Wizards get a win against the team they might be playing in the first round. Depends on tomorrow to see what the matchups are going to be.

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

Suns (20-61) 124

Mavs (24-57) 97

Mavericks able to get a clutch loss against the Suns, who were probably not at the top of their tanking game considering they already clinched the top spot. Mavericks will end tied for 3rd now.

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

Warriors(58-23) 79

Jazz (47-33) 119

Jazz get the Bulls a really nice win here to stay in front of the Pelicans. Now they just need a win or a Pelicans loss to finish ahead of the Pelicans in the West.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Rockets(64-16) 105

Lakers (34-46) 99

Rockets coasting to the end of the season, we gotta hope they rest a good amount of players tomorrow so the Kings can get a win against them.

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games** 

&nbsp;

Nets (28-53) vs Celtics (54-27)

Spread: Nets -1.0

If the Bulls lose then this game doesn't matter. If we win, however, a Nets win here would keep them behind us in the lottery standings instead of tied with us. If we were to win, being tied with the least amount of teams is better for lottery odds, and also better for our odds of still getting the 7th pick if we lose the lottery. 

**Go Nets!**

&nbsp;

Knicks (28-53) vs Cavaliers (50-31)

Spread: Cavaliers -14.5

This is basically identical to the Nets game, doesn't matter unless we win. If we won and somehow the Nets and Knicks both pulled upsets, we would keep our sole possession of 7th. Let's just hope that we lose and don't have to depend on two unlikely upsets.

**Go Knicks!**

&nbsp;

Raptors (59-22) vs Heat (43-38)

Spread: Heat -4.0

If the Raptors win this is likely a preview of the first round playoff matchup. Neither team affects the Bulls though so root for whoever you'd like.

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

Wizards (43-38) vs Magic (24-57)

Spread: Wizards -5.5

Magic need to lose to tie the Hawks and Mavericks, and the Wizards playoff seeding depends on this game as well. None of it affects the Bulls, but a big game for both teams.

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

Bucks (44-37) vs 76ers (51-30) 

Spread: 76ers -6.5

This could be a preview of the first round matchup in the East. I'm not sure of the tiebreaker situation, but the two teams are currently 1 game ahead of the teams chasing them. Depending on those tiebreakers there could be some movement seeding wise.

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

Pistons (38-43) vs Bulls (27-54)

Spread: Pistons -3.5

We were able to get 2 straight losses to the Nets to get down to 7th, but to hold our position we need one more strong night of tanking. Pistons are better, but definitely not an automatic win. They are as inconsistent as it gets, and we really have to hope we're catching them on a good night or we could play well enough to win. A loss get us at least 7th, possibly 6th. A win most likely gets us in a 3 way tie for 7th with a possibility of that turning into a 2 way tie or sole possession depending on how the Nets and Knicks games go. Just one more game, lets tank this!

**Go Pistons!**

&nbsp;

Nuggets (46-35) vs Timberwolves (46-35) 

Spread: Timberwolves -3.5

Huge game, as the winner gets into the playoffs and the loser goes home. Best case scenario is that the Pelicans lose their game and then the winner of this game is tied with the Pelicans for the worst record in the West. Seeding doesn't actually matter for draft order, just regular season record, so we just need that Pelicans loss and then there will be a coin flip to decide 18th and 19th pick. 

**Both teams affect Pelicans pick the same**

&nbsp;

Spurs (47-34) vs Pelicans (47-34) 

Spread: Pelicans -3.5

Depending on the results of today, the Pelicans pick could end up as high as 18 or as low as 23. This is the biggest deciding factor of that, with a loss guaranteeing a top 20 pick. With so many teams close in record in the West, both teams will be fighting hard for the win. I'm not sure on the Spurs tiebreakers, but the Pelicans could finish 4th or 8th in the West depending on this game and others. 

**Go Spurs!**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (22-59) vs Thunder (47-34) 

Spread: Thunder 16.5

Whether the Pelicans win or lose, we need the Thunder to close out the season with a win to help our pick. If the Pelicans win, we need the Thunder to win to make it a 4 way tie (Pelicans, Thunder, Pacers, loser of Jazz vs Blazers) for the 20th pick instead of a 3 way tie for the 21st pick. If the Pelicans lose, we need the Thunder to be ahead of them so that it is just a 2 way tie (Pelicans and winner of Nuggets vs Wolves) for 18th pick instead of a 3 way tie for 18th pick. 

**Go Thunder!**

&nbsp;

Lakers (34-47) vs Clippers (42-39) 

Spread: Clippers -2.5

Both teams are out of the playoffs and also already have their lottery spots decided. Neither team is affected at all by the outcome.

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

Jazz (48-33) vs Trail Blazers (48-33) 

Spread: Trail Blazers -3.5

Both teams are 1 game ahead of the Pelicans in the West, so we pretty much just need the Pelicans to lose so that they don't catch one of them. Like I said earlier, the Pelicans winning would tie them with the loser of this game, making it a coin flip between 3 or 4 teams to figure out who gets what pick. Winner of this game also gets the 3 seed in the West so it should be a good one.

**Both teams affect Pelicans pick the same**

&nbsp;

Rockets (65-16) vs Kings (26-55) 

Spread: Rockets -3.5

If the Bulls lose to the Pistons, this game becomes an opportunity for the Bulls to tie the Kings for the 6th lottery spot. Rockets just played last night and also had an injury to Luc Mbah a Mou, so I would expect them to be resting a lot of their guys. Even without their best players they are still a very tough team so it won't be easy for the Kings to get this win. As long as the Bulls lose our game I'm happy, but this would be some nice icing on the cake.

**Go Kings!**

"What do you guys think of them? I’m sure it’s been discussed already but there’s a big game tomorrow for them against the Nuggets, with the winner making the playoffs and the loser going home.

"There's plenty of very talented players that are projected to go later on in the first round or possibly even in the second round. Some players that come to mind are:



Jalen Brunson - Gets criticized for his lack of athleticism, but has gone on to win just about every college basketball award known to man. Obviously college ball success doesn't directly correlate to NBA success, but I feel like we could get some great value if we pick Jalen around 20-30. He would make a fine backup PG that we desperately need, and he always has the possibility to break out.



Kieta Bates-Diop: He has struggled with Free throws, but was an efficient scorer and also played some good defense. He is going super late currently on Tankathon (pick 28) and would love that value. I don't think he'll go that late but getting him late would be great value and we could hopefully develop him alongside Denzel and another SF we take with our current picks.



Devonte' Graham: He led Kansas the final 4 averaging 17.3 points and 7.2 assists. His biggest knock is probably his age because he is a senior. Old age is usually frowned upon, but I feel as he could become a great leader for some of our young guys and would love to have him as our back up PG. He is currently projected to go around the beginning of the second round, so we probably wouldn't have to give too much away for this pick.

What other guys would you be interested in trading some players for? I'm not suggesting we trade away our current picks or any really important players, but players like Grant, Holiday, etc. could possibly get us a late pick(s) with more upside. Who do you think would be good trade partners?

"When the spotlight was at its brightest, the Bulls were able to lose two clutch games in a row to the Nets to take full control of the 7th lottery spot. We still have to lose tomorrow against the Pistons to solidify the 7th spot, but we're almost there. It wasn't a perfect night, with the Pelicans clinching the playoffs and the Kings losing to stay ahead of us, but all things considered I'm pretty happy with how last night went.

With only two days left in the season, there are only two games that mean anything to the Bulls tonight. The Pacers can clinch a better record than the Pelicans with a win tonight, and the Jazz can stay a game ahead of the Pelicans if they can beat the Warriors. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

**1 (much more important) game good for tank; 2 games bad for the tank**

**4 games good for Pelicans pick; 1 (much more important) game bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Raptors(58-22) 108

Pistons (38-42) 98

It's nice to see the Pistons play so well in the first half against one of the best teams before the Raptors took the game back. We need a really strong game from the Pistons tomorrow so we don't pick up a win to ruin our progress.

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

Bulls (27-53) 105

Nets (27-53) 114

We kept it dangerously close for pretty much the whole game, but the Nets kept the lead for almost the whole game to get us a loss we needed desperately. Huge thanks to Crabbe for playing lights out. Kilpatrick was able to lead our team in scoring again, but luckily it wasn't enough to win. Lauri had a bit of a disappointing game shooting, but he's been so hot lately that an off night was bound to happen.

This loss puts us in sole possession of 7th place. Not only is that a huge spot to move up in the top ten, but it also almost doubles our lottery chances from just a few days ago. 7th is likely where we will end up if we can just manage to get one more loss tomorrow against the Pistons (might not be too easy). We could tie for 6th if the Kings beat the Rockets, but that's not likely enough to count on. If we did win the last game, it would put us in a 3 way tie for 7th with the Nets and Knicks (unless one or both of them won). If that were to happen we would still have a 1 in 3 chance at the 7th pick, but it would hurt our lottery chances significantly. We're almost done with our tank this year, just one more huge game to go.

**Good for tank x2**

&nbsp;

Thunder(46-34) 115

Heat (43-37) 93

Thunder get a win that is very good for us, keeping them tied with the Pelicans in the West. The Pelicans clinched the playoffs, so now we need the Thunder to win their last game (vs Grizzlies) to either take the lead or stay tied with the Pelicans. 

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Cavs (49-31) 123

Knicks(28-52) 109

Knicks did a pretty good job going on some runs to keep the game close, but the Cavaliers went on several runs to keep the lead for the majority of the game. If we lose tomorrow than we have nothing to worry about with the Knicks, but they can still tie us now if we win and they lose. They are currently tied for the 8th pick with the Nets now.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Magic (24-56) 86

Bucks (43-37) 102

Bucks go on a 4th quarter run to take the game. Bucks are now the 6th seed in the East and the Magic are in a 3 way tie for 3rd in the lottery standings.

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies(22-58) 94

Wolves (45-35) 113

This game isn't quite as good for the Bulls since the Pelicans won to clinch the playoffs. It is still good though because if the Spurs can beat the Pelicans tomorrow, the winner of Nuggets vs Timberwolves will tie the Pelicans for the 8th seed in the playoffs. 

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Kings (26-54) 85

Spurs (46-34) 98

This one was a frustrating game for us. The Kings were ahead for the whole game, with a lead as high as 14 in the second half. The Spurs were able to win it in the end by outscoring the Kings 38-19 in the 4th quarter. A Kings win would have been amazing to tie us for 6th, but it was a long shot in the first place with the last 2 Kings games being against the Spurs and Rockets. Spurs win is still good for us though because they stay tied with the Pelicans in the West. If they are able to beat the Pelicans tomorrow they will take the lead over them and could possibly put our pick as high as 18.

**Bad for tank, Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Blazers (48-32) 82

Nuggets(45-35) 88

Just like the Timberwolves game, this would have been a lot better if the Pelicans had lost their game tonight. This creates a play-in game for the last seed in the playoffs between the Timberwolves and Nuggets. Winner of that game can tie the Pelicans for the 18th pick if the Spurs can beat the Pelicans tomorrow.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Pelicans (46-34) 113

Clippers (42-38) 100

Clippers kept the game close in the first half, but just got destroyed in the 3rd quarter to lose the game. This takes away our chance for the Pelicans to miss the playoffs and get the 14th pick. However, the Pelicans pick can be as low as 18th if they lose to the Spurs tomorrow. That loss would tie them with the winner of Wolves vs Nuggets, and possibly the Thunder if they lost. If the Pelicans win tomorrow the pick would be somewhere between 20-24.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games** 

&nbsp;

Hornets (35-46) vs Pacers (48-33)

Spread: Pacers -6.0

Pacers are 1 game ahead of the Pelicans with 1 game left for each of them. Pacers win today would ensure that the Pelicans pick will be in the top 23. Pacers are playing pretty well and I like their chances here.

**Go Pacers!**

&nbsp;

76ers (50-30) vs Hawks (24-57)

Spread: 76ers -9.5

This game doesn't affect us. 76ers are going for their 15th win in a row, and the Hawks are battling for 3rd in the lottery standings. Likely they both get what they want.

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

Celtics (54-26) vs Wizards (42-38)

Spread: Wizards -6.5

Doesn't affect the Bulls, but a loss here would give the Wizards the 8th seed in the East I believe. Crazy how far they've fallen, wish we didn't play them during this bad stretch they're having.

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

Suns (20-61) vs Mavericks (24-57)

Spread: No line yet

Doesn't affect the Bulls. Suns already locked up the top lottery spot but the Mavericks are tied for 3rd with the Magic and Hawks. They look like the most likely to lose that tie with a tough game here.

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

Warriors (58-23) vs Jazz (47-33) 

Spread: Jazz -7.0

Jazz are just 0.5 games ahead of the Pelicans now, and need to win tonight and tomorrow to ensure they stay ahead of them. If the Jazz lose this game they will be tied with the Pelicans (and Thunder and Spurs) for the 19th pick. That would put the Jazz in danger of ending the season tied with the Pelicans, or possibly even behind them. Jazz staying ahead of the Pelicans is very important for our pick, need them to win tonight.

**Go Jazz!**

&nbsp;

Rockets (64-16) vs Lakers (34-46)

Spread: No line yet

Doesn't affect the Bulls. Rockets locked up the top seed a while ago, Lakers just figuring out if they have the 10th or 11th lottery spot.

"Now hear me out... what if we could trade both our first round picks for kawhi Leonard? I think it would make sense for both teams he obviously doesn’t wanna play their anymore and he’s a fantastic player and he’s still really young and would instantly make the bulls a much better team and I think the spurs would actually take that deal being a small market team it’s hard to get stars to come there and they could get two top 15 picks and start rebuilding for their future!

Then the bulls starting lineup would be 

PG Dunn
SG lavine 
SF leonard 
PF markkanen 
C Lopez 

That would be a playoff caliber starting lineup in my opinion prolly 6-8th seed in the east? 

What do y’all think?","Here’s my thoughts on the bulls draft strategy this year let me know what you think! Now hear me out... what if we could trade both our first round picks for kawhi Leonard?

"Another good day for the Bulls yesterday. The two teams that were most important for us, the Pacers and Jazz, both got wins to keep their leads over the Pelicans. The Magic lost and can now no longer be caught, but that was going to happen sooner or later anyways. 

Today is another huge day, with all of the important tanks playing today, plus many of the important Pelicans pick teams too. We have our second game against the Nets, in which we can move into sole possession of the 7th lottery spot with a loss. Knicks have their first of two games against the Cavaliers, where they can give us more cushion if they win. Kings can tie us if they beat the Spurs, but the Spurs win would be good for the Pelicans pick too. If the Pelicans win their game today against the Clippers, they clinch the playoffs. Even if they make the playoffs, we can still get that pick as low as 18 if the right playoff teams can win for us.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

**0 games good for tank; 1 game bad for the tank**

**2 games good for Pelicans pick; 0 games bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Pacers (48-33) 123

Hornets(35-46) 117

This Pacers win ensures that the Pelicans can not end with a better record than them, they could tie if the Pelicans win out and Pacers lose their last game, but even that would just end in a coin flip for who gets the better pick.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Mavs (24-56) 97

76ers(49-30) 109

This one didn't matter to us at all, but it ties the Mavericks with the Hawks for the 3rd lottery spot. Also is the 14th win in a row for the 76ers, looking really good going into the playoffs.

**Doesn't affect either pick**

&nbsp;

Hawks (23-57) 112

Celtics (54-25) 106

Hawks were down almost the whole game but bad a crazy 4th quarter comeback to win it. Not sure their fans are going to like it though with it letting the Mavs tie them for 

**Doesn't affect either pick**

&nbsp;

Pistons (38-41) 117

Grizzlies(21-58) 130

This doesn't affect any of our picks directly, but it's very worrying to see the Pistons get beat so easily by the Grizzlies when we are depending on them to beat us in the last game. Whether we win or lose today against the Nets, the last game vs the Pistons could mean the difference between a lot of lottery chances and a few draft spots.

**Doesn't affect either pick**

&nbsp;

Magic (24-55) 101

Raptors(57-22) 112

The Magic would have had to win out against 3 playoff teams in a row for us to catch them, so don't lose too much sleep over them being out of reach now. The only tanks that are factors now are the Knicks, Nets, and Kings.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Jazz (46-33) 112

Lakers(34-45) 97

Jazz clinch the playoffs with this win over the Lakers, and more importantly they stay in front of the Pelicans in the West. The lead is still just one game, so we still need some more wins from the Jazz to secure their place above the Pelicans for sure.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Warriors(57-23) 117

Suns (20-60) 100

Warriors find it in them to beat the Suns after losing their game to the Pelicans last night.

**Doesn't affect either pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games** 

&nbsp;

Raptors (58-22) vs Pistons (38-42)

Spread: No line yet

Neither team will affect the Bulls, but it would be nice to see the Pistons have a good showing before they play us in the last game.

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

Bulls (27-53) vs Nets (27-53)

Spread: Nets -7.0

We were able to lose the first one, and if we can manage to lose to them again, we will be in sole possession of the 7th lottery spot. From where we were just a week ago, that would be a huge jump in lottery odds, and (failing the lottery) a pretty significant few spots in the top ten. While a loss would give us 7th, a win would put us back tied with the Knicks for 8th/9th with about half the lottery chances we would have if we lost. This is absolutely huge and we desperately need to lose it.

**Go Nets!**

&nbsp;

Thunder (46-34) vs Heat (43-37)

Spread: Thunder -2.5

Thunder are still tied with the Pelicans right now, and a win for them here is very important. Whether the Pelicans make the playoffs or not, we need the Thunder to win to keep as much ahead of the Pelicans as possible.

**Go Thunder!**

&nbsp;

Cavaliers (49-31) vs Knicks (28-52)

Spread: No line yet

Knicks have their last two games against the Cavaliers, and hopefully they can squeeze a win out of them here or in the next one. If the Bulls lose out like we hope, the Knicks games don't really matter, but if the Bulls were able to win one of their last two, they would be tied with the Knicks for 7th or 8th. A win here would be a nice relief to have so we can at least stay in front of the Knicks if we win.

**Go Knicks!**

&nbsp;

Magic (24-56) vs Bucks (43-37) 

Spread: No line yet

Magic can't be caught by the Bulls anymore and the Bucks can't catch the Pelicans anymore. Take your pick in this one.

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (22-58) vs Timberwolves (45-35)

Spread: No line yet

Timberwolves need to win this game if they are going to have a chance at forcing the Pelicans out of the playoffs. They also need to win for their own sake of making the playoffs so let's hope they can take the Grizzlies down

**Go Timberwolves!**

&nbsp;

Kings (26-54) vs Spurs (46-34)

Spread: Spurs -13.5

This one is tough because it features two crucial teams to each of our picks. The Kings get the edge because moving up with our own pick is more valuable than with the Pelicans pick. Also a little because the Spurs can beat the Pelicans tomorrow to catch them even if they lose here. A Kings win would be amazing, because combined with a Bulls loss it would put us tied for the 6th lottery spot with them. Spurs win would not be too bad either, with them still tied with the Pelicans in the playoffs.

**Go Kings!**

&nbsp;

Trail Blazers (48-32) vs Nuggets (45-35)

Spread: Nuggets -4.0

For there to be any chance for the Pelicans to miss the playoffs, we need the Nuggets and Timberwolves to finish strong. We can afford either the Nuggets OR Timberwolves to lose today, but only if that team wins the last game when they play each other. If the Pelicans win one of their last two and are in the playoffs, we could still have the Nuggets or Timberwolves catch them with two wins. It wouldn't knock them out of the playoffs but it would tie them and have a chance to improve the pick.

**Go Nuggets!**

&nbsp;

Pelicans (46-34) vs Clippers (42-38)

Spread: Pelicans -6.5

Clippers are out of the playoffs now but we have to hope they can find it in them to beat the Pelicans here. If the Pelicans win they clinch the playoffs, and also might gain a few spots in the standings. If they lose this, they are one loss away from possibly missing the playoffs, and it would also give other teams a chance to take a lead on them.

**Go Clippers!**

"Hello again, if there’s anyone who remembers my last post here! I was the guy who was surprising his Dad by taking him to Chicago and a Bulls game for our first time! So just a little update on that if anyone was wondering, it went great! We drove into town and got some Lou Malnati’s! The greatest pizza I ever had in my life! We did some shopping at some local sports card shops (Elite & Tim’s), (my dads a big sports card collector of the years his children were born), and then checked out Laurie’s Planet of Sound, my Dad and I bond over vinyl records! (I love vinyls and he grew up in the generation when all of it was popular!). After that we made it in time to the United Center to get our parking and make it to the game! 
Man, as a lifelong Bulls fan finally getting to see his first game, I just can’t emphasize the emotion I had and put how special it was to me into words. When you’re going to a home game in Chicago, there’s a certain magical energy to it. I’ve never been to Disney land, but I imagine that there would be a similar feeling. You get there, and you see all the people, as you just take it all in. There’s cars packing the streets, the police are out everywhere, people playing musical instruments, people selling parking, people all pouring in to see the game, everyone’s wearing red, everyone has a Chicago Bulls tee shirt, or a jersey, or a hat. I come from the small little town of South Bend, Indiana, where there’s not a whole lot going on and you have the University of Notre Dame shoved down your throat on a daily basis, seeing all these people all wearing Bulls stuff was so cool! There’s people everywhere, it’s packed and everyone’s coming into the game. The atmosphere is something to take in. Decades of tradition, history, decades of fans coming in for these games, it’s surreal. You walk into the United Center, it’s crammed full of people as you try to get around. Then when you first make it in, as you walk up the stairs to see your seat, you can see the Arena from the stairs through each doorway as you’re so close. It’s powerful. As you walk in, you take it all in, the court’’s floor, the logo, all the banners, this is it. This is what I’ve seen on TV all these nights of my life. This is where it all happened. This is where Jordan played at. Where Pippen played. This is where Derrick Rose was that flashy young MVP. This is where Jimmy Butler played. Championships won, History. What a great time!
I made sure to stop and get a picture of the trophies. I checked out the Jordan statue and the Pippen bust. Man the food was expensive there, no joke! $10 for a beer, $6 something for a drink! We made it in early, got to see everyone warming up and sit and get comfy and experience it all.

The part I was most excited to see was the famous Chicago Bulls intro! I wanted to experience that. Since I was a kid I loved the video of the Bulls running on the screen. Well, after sitting in my seat and the time finally counting down, then the National anthem, I’m hyped up to see it! This is it!!! The video starts, AND AN OLDER ASIAN MAN COMES UP WITH HIS FRIEND AND SAYS “Hey I think you guys are in our seats” to myself and this little kid while her mother is away at the bathroom or something. Well I have to defend this kid now, he says this is row “xxx” I correct him and say “NO this is row xxx this is the direction the usher told me and literally what the sign says” he asks to look at my ticket and the kids ticket. I show him mine, kids mom has his ticket. I’m pissed, I tell him to go ask the usher or get her. Try to ignore him. He finally walks away. So I take my attention back to the game, AND THE VIDEO IS OVER. I MISSED IT. They’re already announcing the players. He comes back later by the way to say “Sorry you were right I had the wrong section” thanks!!! 

Our Bulls lost, it was 90’s night and Coolio was there to perform during halftime? So I saw Gangster’s Paradise live??? The Loyola basketball team was there! Great ovation they got! Horace Grant was there! I saw Horace Grant downstairs with two sportscasters while they were recording live on TV.  Nets beat us, they moved the ball around great and got some great shots. Bulls looked uninspired. Ended my night by driving home and getting some White Castle! 

Thanks to everyone, thank you for the recommendations! Proud to be a Bulls Fan!  [surprising my dad](https://m.imgur.com/a/FkH13)","The tale of my first Bulls game and the guy who ruined the intro!

"Pretty good day for the Bulls, we are back tied for 7th again and can take sole possession if we lose again to the Nets tomorrow. Most of the other games went our way too, but the Warriors couldn't manage to edge the Pelicans for us. To miss the playoffs, the Pelicans are going to have to lose their last two. If they make the playoffs, we have hope they lose at least one of the last two games so as many playoff teams as possible can pass them.

Today there are 7 games, but the only two that affect the Bulls (unless the Magic are able to beat the Raptors and win out) are the Pacers and Jazz games. Those are two teams currently ahead of the Pelicans that could still be caught if they don't win enough. Even if the Pelicans make the playoffs, we can still keep that pick in the teens if the teams even and above them win.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Nuggets (44-35) 134

Clippers (42-37) 115

Nuggets get the win they needed to still have a chance to catch the Pelicans. Problem is the Pelicans won too so their win might not mean much if the Pelicans don't lose their next two. Either way the Nuggets are playing very well to keep their playoff chances alive. Pistons were eliminated from playoff contention with this loss, but we still really need them in their next game vs the Pelicans.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Bucks (43-37) 115

Knicks (28-52) 102

Knicks actually did play pretty well for a while, taking several leads including a short one in the 4th quarter. Bucks took control about halfway through the 4th though to secure the game. If the Bulls lose out we don't need to worry about the Knicks anymore, but if we get a win in our last two games we could be back tied with the Knicks. To make things easier it would help a lot if they could get a win in one of their two games against the Cavs to end the season.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Nets (26-53) 124

Bulls (27-52) 96

The Nets were able to come in and dominate us to put us back tied for 7th. Kilpatrick had yet another good game as he lead the team with 20, but the Nets were shooting too well to be beat, making a record 24 3-pointers. This was an amazing game for the Bulls, and we're just 2 losses away from salvaging what recently seemed impossible. Lauri will likely be back next game, so we are going to need the other guys on the team (especially fucking Kilpatrick) to have some off nights to hopefully balance things out. Best scenario is the Nets have another amazing game on offense and we have nothing to worry about.

**Good for tank x2**

&nbsp;

Thunder (45-34) 108

Rockets (64-15) 102

Thunder were behind early, but had a really strong second half to take the win. This is huge both for us and them, as they stay tied with the Pelicans and still just 1 game from missing the playoffs. Whatever the Pelicans do over their last 2 games, Thunder have to beat it, or at least match it, to help our our pick.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Pelicans (45-34) 126

Warriors(57-22) 120

Durant dropped 41 but the Warriors were just not able to keep the Pelicans from scoring. This is a bad one for the Bulls, as the chances of the Pelicans missing the playoffs are now significantly lower than they would have been if the Pelicans lost. They will have to lose to the Pistons and then Spurs just to have a chance to miss. If they do make the playoffs, we have to hope the still lose at least one of those games. There are 5 other playoff teams that are within 1 game of the Pelicans now. The teams even or ahead need to finish ahead of them and the teams behind need to tie them. Making the playoffs, the Pelicans pick could still be as low as 18 or as high as 23. Any ties would be decided by a coin flip.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Blazers(48-31) 105

Spurs (45-34) 116

Spurs stay even with the Pelicans with the chance to pass them in their last game against them. That last game vs the Pelicans is the most important game left in the seasons that has to do with the Pelicans pick. Trail Blazers could actually still be tied if the Pelicans go 2-0 and the Blazers go 0-2, so we still need them to pick up one more win to stay ahead for us.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games** 

&nbsp;

Pacers (47-33) vs Hornets (35-45)

Spread: Hornets -1.0

This one is already started and will probably be at about halftime by the time I post this. Things are looking good so far for the Pacers, who are only 1 game ahead of the Pelicans. If the Pelicans make the playoffs, which seems very likely right now, the Pacers are a very important team that needs to stay ahead of the Pels.

**Go Pacers!**

&nbsp;

Mavericks (24-56) vs 76ers (49-30)

Spread: 76ers -13.0

Also underway, and looks like the 76ers covered the spread and them some before halftime. We can't catch the Mavericks anymore though so no big deal for us.

**Doesn't affect either pick**

&nbsp;

Hawks (23-57) vs Celtics (54-25)

Spread: Celtics -9.5

Another game that already started (Celtics ahead as expected), and another one that also doesn't affect the Bulls at all.

**Doesn't affect either pick**

&nbsp;

Pistons (38-41) vs Grizzlies (21-58)

Spread: Pistons -6.5

Neither teams affects either pick anymore, take your pick.

**Doesn't affect either pick**

&nbsp;

Magic (24-55) vs Raptors (57-22) 

Spread: Raptors -13.0

Magic could still be tied if they win the rest of their games and we lose the rest of ours. Not likely but if they can win this one then I'd be a believer.

**Go Magic!**

&nbsp;

Jazz (46-33) vs Lakers (34-45)

Spread: Jazz -8.0

Jazz are only ahead of the Pelicans by 0.5 games. The are a crucial team to keep ahead of the Pelicans, and luckily they are playing very well right now. They have a tough schedule to end the season but they can definitely finish ahead of the Pelicans if they keep playing well.

**Go Jazz!**

&nbsp;

Warriors (57-23) vs Suns (20-60)

Spread: Warriors -13.0

Both teams are way out of reach for anyone affecting the Bulls so take your pick.

**Doesn't affect either pick**

"What a great day yesterday! We lost, Knicks won, Kings won, and Timberwolves won. Things went better than I think anyone expected and now our lottery spot has some much better chances. The only important game that didn't go our way was the Pelicans beating the Suns, and that would have taken a pretty horrible game from the Pels. 

Today there are only 6 games but each one is very important to us. For the Bulls there is the first of two games that could decide our season. Even through all of our wins lately, we still have a chance at the 6th or 7th spot if we can lose twice to the Nets and the finish the season with a loss to the Pistons. We control our own destiny and will end up no worse than 7th if we just lose 3 games in a row. That one is obviously most important, but there is also another Pelicans game in which we really need a loss. They play the Warriors, and if they lose there is a much better chance they miss the playoffs. There are also important Nuggets, Spurs and Thunder games they need to win, and a Knicks game that could give us a little extra cushion. If there was ever a day for there to be a good day for the tank it's today.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Mavericks(24-55) 106

Pistons (37-41) 113

This was pretty much already decided, but it's now mathematically impossible for us to catch the Mavericks. They actually did a pretty good job keeping the game close, which worries me about our last game against the Pistons.

**(slightly) Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Hornets(34-45) 137

Magic (24-54) 100

Hornets just obliterate the Magic, lead by 45 at one point. Again, pretty much already decided, but the Magic need just one more loss to be impossible to catch.

**(slightly) Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Cavs (49-30) 130

76ers(48-30) 132

76ers clinch finishing ahead of the Pelicans. They have been great for us, coming from several games back of the Pelicans to take a huge lead on them. Cavaliers are also clinched ahead of the Pelicans so we don't need to root for either of these teams anymore. 

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Hawks (22-57) 103

Wizards(42-37) 97

Wizards are tanking better than we are right now for some reason, lose again to the Hawks. Wizards are tied with the Grizzlies for the longest current losing streak in the NBA, at 4 games. We really played them at a bad time. Wizards can't catch the Pelicans anymore so we don't need to root for them anymore.

**Neither team affects the Bulls**

&nbsp;

Bulls (27-51) 104

Celtics(53-25) 111

We took a big lead early and then kept it close for a long time, but were finally able to close out a 4th quarter with a loss. Lauri had another great game with 20 points in just 23 minutes, and Kilpatrick scored 24 on some lethal shooting. Love to see Lauri continue his hot streak, but damn Kilpatrick needs to chill if we are going to finish this season right. It sucks to root for him to get cold, because being a late season free agent like he is, he needs this success to get on someone's roster next year. Best case scenario the Nets just go off for like 130 points in both nights and then everyone can keep shooting well and lose. 

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Heat (43-36) 98

Knicks(27-51) 122

Knicks get a huge upset win that gives us yet another chance to finish the season ahead of them. Dotson dropped 30 off the bench to lead the Knicks, and they just dominated the Heat from start to finish. This was the upset win for the Knicks I was afraid wouldn't happen, and it puts us back in control of the 8th spot. Knicks have the Bucks and then Cavs x2 to finish the season, so another one of these upsets would certainly help. If they do lose out, we now can stay ahead by losing our ourselves. 

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Pacers (47-32) 73

Raptors(56-22) 92

Pacers are now only 1.5 games ahead of the Pelicans, much easier to see them getting passed now. Gotta hope they can finish strong and stay ahead.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Kings (25-54) 94

Grizzlies(21-57) 93

Kings keep our hopes of tying them alive with their win here. Even if the Bulls lose out though, it would take a win over the Spurs or Rockets for us just get even with them. Not likely but it's always good to have the chance.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Pels (44-34) 122

Suns(20-59) 103

Pelicans took the early lead and got a decisive win. An upset here was a pipe dream anyway, can't be too upset about this with how the rest of the games went. Pelicans last 3 games are the hard ones now, if they can lose 2-3 of them they can still fall out of the playoffs.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Wolves(44-35) 113

Lakers (34-44) 96

Timberwolves get a much needed win to stay just 0.5 games back of the Pelicans. They have not been good at all lately but we really need them to win their next game against the Grizzlies now and then we'll have to see what happens to know who to root for in the season finale vs the Nuggets.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games** 

&nbsp;

Mavericks (24-55) vs Pistons (37-41)

Spread: Pistons -7.0

Mavericks can mathematically be caught but they have to win out to do so. That's not gonna happen but the Pistons can't do anything for or against us so might as well root for that Mavs streak.

**Go Mavericks!**

&nbsp;

Nuggets (44-35) vs Clippers (42-37)

Spread: No line yet

Nuggets are just 1 games behind the Pelicans, need to get this win to still give themselves a chance. They are playing well but Clippers are still fighting for a playoff spot too so it won't be easy. Clippers could still mathematically catch the Pelicans, but the chances aren't good.

**Go Nuggets!**

&nbsp;

Bucks (42-37) vs Knicks (42-37)

Spread: Knicks -1.0 (lol)

Knicks win yesterday was all I was hoping to get from them, but they could help even more with a win tonight. I hope the Bulls lose out, but if we don't it would be nice to have another game of cushion in front of the Knicks so we don't end up in 9th. I thought I'd be rooting for the upset, but apparently as of now the Knicks are actually favored. 

**Go Knicks!**

&nbsp;

Nets (26-53) vs Bulls (27-52) 

Spread: Bulls -1.0

We play the Nets twice in a row, need to start it off strong if we want the second one to even really matter. Winning this game puts us back even with the Knicks for 9th and pretty much takes away our chances at 7th. Losing this puts us even with the Nets, and just one more loss away from taking the lead from them. Nets played well to upset the Bucks in their last game, but we've shown to be playing well too so we really need to see the Nets best to ensure this game is a loss. As huge as the rest of these games are, this is the only one that decides whether it was a good or bad day for the Bulls.

**Go Nets!**

&nbsp;

Thunder (45-34) vs Rockets (64-15)

Spread: Rockets -6.5

Thunder are tied with the Pelicans now and don't have the easiest opponent as they try to take the lead. They finish against the Heat and Grizzlies, so if they can win this one I like their chances.

**Go Thunder!**

&nbsp;

Pelicans (45-34) vs Warriors (57-22)

Spread: Warriors -1.0

Pelicans are away on the second night of a back to back, against the Warriors. I like the chances of them losing, but Warriors aren't the same invincible team right now with how many injuries they've had recently. Like I said above, Pelicans need to lose 2-3 games the rest of the season to have a good chance to miss the playoffs. This one would be a really good start.

**Go Warriors!**

&nbsp;

Trail Blazers (48-31) vs Spurs (45-34)

Spread: No line yet

Spurs are now tied with the Pelicans, could really use the win to either take the lead or keep pace with them. The Spurs play the Pelicans in their last game so if they can just stay even at the very least, they'll have a chance to pass them.

**Go Spurs!**

"*Should be able to update these summaries within the hour

The Nets pull yet another upset on a playoff team to keep our hopes of passing them alive. They are really giving us every chance to finish ahead of them and now it's time to see if we are going to take it. In addition, Nuggets won their game and Clippers lost theirs so we are going to be putting our hopes in the Nuggets to catch the Pelicans and force them out of the playoffs. Except now we also need the Timberwolves to catch them as well.

Today we have our last game before the two Nets games, this time against the Celtics. Knicks play the Heat in their first of 4 games against playoff teams. For our other pick, the Pelicans have another easy one against the Suns and Timberwolves need a win desperately against the Lakers. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Warriors(57-21) 106

Pacers (46-32) 126

Pacers sweep the Warriors for the season and maintain their 2.5 games lead on the Pelicans. I like their chances of staying ahead for the last few games but they need to keep playing well for that to happen.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Wizards (42-36) 115

Cavaliers(48-30) 119

Cavaliers are now impossible to catch for the Pelicans, but it would have helped us a lot more if the Wizards could have kept pace with the Pelicans instead. Wizards are pretty much a non-factor now at 2.5 games back, but they play 2 tanks over their last 3. If they win out they have a slim chance at tying.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Blazers (48-30) 94

Rockets (63-15) 96

Trail Blazers had a huge comeback from down 24 points, but Paul hit the winner with a second left to finish the game off. Blazers could still get caught by the Pelicans, but they would have to lose out and the Pels win out for that to happen so no big deal here.

**(very slightly) Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Nets (25-53) 119

Bucks(42-36) 111

What a win for the Nets! They lead the Bucks for almost the whole game and then looked like they were going to pull another one of their 4th quarter losses. Instead they took the lead back and finished the game strong. All their best players were shooting well and they limited Giannis to just 19 points. 

This win opens up the chance for the Bulls to finish ahead of the Nets, when if they lost the best we could have hoped for would be tied with them. In addition it is good to see them playing good basketball right before their two games with us. We really have to hope that they continue that good play now, because we have shown our troubling ability to win even with a terrible lineup.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Clips (42-36) 95

Jazz (45-33) 117

So like I said yesterday this one is complicated. Clippers losing is bad because they are now 2.5 games back of the Pelicans with only 3 games to catch them. That looks pretty hopeless but one of their games is vs the Pelicans, so if they were to win out and get some help from the Pels there's still a chance. However, one of their games is also against the Nuggets so in the bigger picture it is probably better if they lose that and don't make the playoffs. The game is also good for the Jazz who are able to stay 1.5 games ahead of the Pelicans. They are one of 5 West teams that are within 1.5 games of the Pelicans, and if all of those teams finish ahead of the Pelicans then our pick goes down to 14.

**Good and Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Wolves (44-34) 96

Nuggets(43-35) 100

This one is even more complicated than the Clippers vs Jazz game. It's bad for the Wolves because they have now been passed by the Pelicans for the last playoff spot. Luckily for us, the Wolves are yet another team that will win a tiebreaker with the Pelicans, so they just need to get back even with them to force them out of the playoffs. The game is good for the Nuggets because they are able to get up to just 0.5 games back of the Pelicans in the West. We need them to keep winning and need the Pelicans to lose enough so that the Nuggets can edge them out of the playoffs.

It looks pretty good for us with the Wolves and Nuggets just 0.5 games behind the Pelicans, but there's one more complication that is really bad for us. The last game of the year for the Nuggets and Timberwolves is against each other. That means that we are going to need some major help from the Pelicans if they are going to miss the playoffs. The best the Pelicans can play and still miss the playoffs is 2-2. If the Pelicans win 3 or 4 games they are in no matter what. If they were to go 2-2, then the Nuggets and Timberwolves could tie or pass the Pelicans, forcing them out of the playoffs. In that 2-2 scenario, the Nuggets and Wolves can only lose 1 game each the rest of the season, with one of those losses obviously coming when they play each other. If they Pelicans were to go 1-3 the rest of the season (very possible, they play 3 playoff teams after the Suns), that opens things up for the Nuggets and Timberwolves a little and it's actually pretty likely that the Pelicans miss the playoffs at that point. 

TL;DR Nuggets and Wolves chances of passing Pelicans depend on Pelicans losing at least 2, hopefully 3 games.

**Good and Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games** 

&nbsp;

Mavericks (24-55) vs Pistons (37-41)

Spread: Pistons -7.0

Mavericks can mathematically be caught but they have to win out to do so. That's not gonna happen but the Pistons can't do anything for or against us so might as well root for that Mavs streak.

**Go Mavericks!**

&nbsp;

Hornets (34-45) vs Magic (24-54)

Spread: Hornets -6.0

Magic are almost definitely out of reach, but mathematically we could still catch them while the Hornets don't affect anything, so might as well root Magic here.

**Go Magic!**

&nbsp;

Cavaliers (49-30) vs 76ers (48-30)

Spread: 76ers -4.0

Both teams are definitely finishing ahead of the Pelicans, but a 76ers win here clinches that for 100% sure.

**Go 76ers!**

&nbsp;

Hawks (22-57) vs Wizards (42-37) 

Spread: Wizards -10.5

Wizards could technically catch the Pelicans, but if they do the Pelicans are out of the playoffs anyways so no need to root for them anymore.

**Neither team affects the Bulls**

&nbsp;

Bulls (27-51) vs Celtics (53-25)

Spread: Celtics -8.5

We've been able to get 2 upset wins in a row, but we really need to not get another today. Our hopes for anything better than 9th are already precarious, and a win here would pretty much guarantee that we finish there. The problem is there's not much more we can do to tank, we already have 2 of our best players out, don't play the other best player in the 4th, and trot out several guys who weren't even on our bench at the beginning of the season. We just have to hope that the hot players will start missing their shots the rest of the season (except Lauri).

**Go Celtics!**

&nbsp;

Heat (43-36) vs Knicks (27-51)

Spread: Heat -8.5

This is one of the Knicks better chances to get a win and break our tie, and I have almost no hope for them to win it. If they don't win tonight or in their next game against the Bucks, they will have to pick one up in 2 games vs the Cavaliers to finish the season. If they lose out (probably most likely) then we would also have to lose out just to tie them. Let's really hope for that upset here.

**Go Knicks!**

&nbsp;

Pacers (47-32) vs Raptors (56-22)

Spread: Raptors -7.5

Pacers are 2.5 games ahead of the Pelicans. They are pretty safe but Raptors don't affect anything so root for a more solid Pacers lead.

**Go Pacers!**

&nbsp;

Kings (25-54) vs Grizzlies (21-57)

Spread: Kings -3.0

Kings could tie the Bulls with two wins and they have a good chance to get one of those tonight. The problem is that they would have to get their other win against either the Spurs or Rockets, which is a bit of a long shot. Still root for them tonight though, just last week the Suns were a shot away from beating the Rockets when they were still playing for something so anything is possible.

**Go Kings!**

&nbsp;

Pelicans (44-34) vs Suns (20-59)

Spread: Pelicans -11.5

Lets hope the Suns can have another one of the games they have had lately against playoff teams. They're still losing a ton, but they've played oddly well against playoff teams. I'm pretty much counting this as a Pelicans win when figuring out how the rest of the season goes, but everything gets a whole lot more promising for our pick if the Suns can pull the upset tonight.

**Go Suns!**

&nbsp;

Timberwolves (44-35) vs Lakers (34-44)

Spread: Timberwolves -4.5

Must win for the Timberwolves. If the Pelicans are going to miss the playoffs, the Wolves pretty much have to win their next 2 before the Nuggets game. Even then they still need some help from the Pelicans losing, but if they lose this we can pretty much give up on that 14 pick.

**Go Pacers!**

"Imagine GarPax is fired today and you're hired tomorrow. With a salary of $61,000,000 out of a $99,000,000 salary cap used up, we're capable of spending approximately $30 million on free agents. That being said, how would you use that salary and what would you do to improve the team via the draft as well as free agency.

For me: I would try to trade up in the draft to score a high enough pick to have a chance at Michael Porter Jr. Then I would try to throw money at Boogie in a bid to lure him into a team that does not have an equally (if not more) talented big man in the starting lineup.

Not a good day for us as the Pelicans were able to get by the Grizzlies and the Spurs could not do the same against the Lakers. In addition the Mavericks (if they weren't already for you) are completely out of reach unless they win out. Only positives are that the 76ers are completely out of reach for the Pelicans and the Heat  could still catch the Pels.

Today is another day light on games, but there are a few more that matter to our picks. Nets have their best chance to get back to 1 game in front of us. If they don't win this game or their last game vs the Celtics, the best we can hope for is tying them. Clippers and Nuggets need to keep winning for one of them to catch the Pelicans, and they both play today. There's a huge problem though in that both teams that they play today are teams who we need to stay in front of the Pelicans (Jazz and Wolves). The best thing that can happen is that either Nuggets or Clippers win and then go on to catch the Pelicans, while the other loses to help the other teams. We don't know if one will be able to go on to do that though so we can't just pick a team. Basically who we root for today depends on how they finish the season so it's guesswork who we should root for.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

76ers (47-30) 115

Pistons(37-40) 108

76ers solidify their place above the Pelicans, won't have to worry about them anymore I believe.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Mavs (24-54) 100

Magic(23-54) 105

Any small chance we had for the Bulls to catch the Mavs is gone now, only rooting for Knicks, Kings, and Nets to win now.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Heat (42-36) 115

Hawks(22-56) 86

Heat could still catch the Pelicans if the Pistons and Nuggets don't knock them out of the playoffs. 

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Celtics (53-24) 78

Raptors(55-22) 96

Wow nice job by the Raptors limiting the Celtics to under 80, good sign for them for the playoffs. 

**Doesn't affect either pick**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (21-56) 95

Pelicans (43-34) 123

I was hopeful early but by halftime it was pretty clear that the Pelicans were gonna win it easily. Pelicans have another easy game against the Suns before they finish the season with 3 playoff contenders. 

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Spurs (45-33) 112

Lakers(33-44) 122

Spurs just can't finish off the Lakers in regulation and then end up crushed in OT. They are only 0.5 games ahead of the Pelicans now but they finish the season against them. Being 2 games ahead at that point would obviously be best, but they can stay even with the Pelicans if they are going to win that last game.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games** 

&nbsp;

Warriors (57-21) vs Pacers (46-32)

Spread: Warriors -2.5

Pacers still have a solid 2 game lead on the Pelicans but increasing it is always good, especially since the Warriors don't affect anything.

**Go Pacers!**

&nbsp;

Wizards (42-36) vs Cavaliers (48-30)

Spread: Cavaliers -6.0

Cavs have are fine at 4 games up on the Pelicans, Wizards could still catch them if they win enough.

**Go Wizards!**

&nbsp;

Trail Blazers (48-30) vs Rockets (63-15) 

Spread: Rockets -10.5

Trail Blazers are 4 games up with 4 games left so the only was they can get caught is if they lose out and Pelicans win out. But since its the Rockets might as well root for the clinch tonight.

**Go Trail Blazers!**

&nbsp;

Nets (25-53) vs Bucks (42-36)

Spread: Bucks -9.0

This is a big one for us, if the Nets win this they will be just 1 game ahead of us, and then we can pass them by losing both of our games against them. If they win this and against the Celtics in their last game, then we would tie them even if they won both of our games. 

**Go Nets!**

&nbsp;

Clippers (42-36) vs Jazz (45-33)

Spread: Jazz -7.5

I would pick the Clippers here, but that's mostly because I'm more confident that the Jazz will bounce back and finish the season ahead of the Pelicans. It's really close though because if the Nuggets can catch the Pelicans then it might be better for the Jazz to win. Like I said, mostly guesswork today, we'll find out who we should have rooted for in like a week.

**Go Clippers! (or Jazz)**

&nbsp;

Timberwolves (44-34) vs Nuggets (43-35)

Spread: Nuggets -5.0

This one is even tougher because Nuggets win would actually push the Wolves behind the Pelicans. There's just so many different scenarios that could happen that we might as well flip a coin for who to root for here. These two teams play each other again in their last game of the season so we'll find out who we should have rooted for by then. What might end up as a possibility is Nuggets AND Clippers having a better chance of catching the Pelicans than the Wolves staying in front of the Pelicans, considering how the Wolves have played lately. It all depends on the Pelicans losing games though, them losing 2-3 games makes it a lot easier for these teams to sort out who passes and catches them.

**Go Nuggets! (or Timberwolves)**

"Favors was a guy I was hopeful we would get at the deadline as he seemed to be a good fit next to Lauri. Instead, it’s looking like we could get a similar but much younger version of Favors.

Wendell Carter to me is like a younger/non injured Favors. He’s an above average rim protector and a force offensively. He has been called the toughest big man in the nation when he was a senior in high school last year and would be great to pair with Lauri.

"*I'll update with more summaries when I have more time later

Just a week ago we were on a 7 game losing streak and our tank was looking very good. Since then we've won all 3 of our games and we're back to fighting just to get the 8th spot back. Just for some perspective, if we lose those 3 games instead and change nothing else, we are currently tied for the 4th lottery spot right now. On top of our win, the Knicks also lost the easiest of their last 5 games to tie us for 8th. The only thing to salvage from yesterday was both the Clippers and Nuggets winning, which increases the chances one of them can force the Pelicans out of the playoffs.

Today is pretty light, with only 2 games that really matter. Pelicans could fall out of the playoffs with a loss today, but they play the Grizzlies so it's a long shot to say the least. Spurs are only 1.5 games ahead of the Pelicans and can stay ahead vs the Lakers today. Mavs pulled an awesome upset last night and play the Magic today, but we pretty much ruined any chance at them by beating the Hornets. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Raptors (55-21) 106

Cavaliers(47-30) 112

Not a huge deal but Cavs get a slightly bigger lead on the Pelicans. Very small chance Pels will move ahead of them.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Nets (25-52) 95

76ers(46-30) 121

Nets can't pull another upset and we're 2 games back of them now. We're going to need them to beat us twice just to be able to tie them now. It's a long shot but if they are able to get just 1 more upset over the Bucks or Celtics then we could still pass them.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Hawks(22-55) 98

Heat (41-36) 101

If the Nuggets and Clippers fail to kick the Pelicans out of the playoffs, Heat could still tie or pass the Pelicans to help us.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Magic (22-54) 97

Knicks(27-50) 73

Magic picked the worst game to destroy their opponent. Knicks tie us up at the 8th spot now and now they don't play another tank the rest of the season. It's hard to see them getting another win, but if we are going to finish ahead of us they're going to have to. I honestly just hope that we don't finish in 9th spot now, if we can just manage to tie for 8th or 7th that would be a blessing at this point.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Hornets(34-44) 114

Bulls (26-51) 120

Another great game for Markkanen, which is awesome. The problem is we take him out in the 4th and these teams still can't beat the guys that might not even be on our bench in a year or two. It's a great sign at how well Holberg's offense is working, but damn we just need to turn a few of these wins into losses and we can be picking a franchise-changing player.

With our schedule vs the rest of the tanks, the most likely result now is that we end the season with sole possession of the 9th lottery spot. The only way to avoid that fate is to lose back to back to the Nets, that would put us in a 3 way tie for 7th, if none of the teams won any of their other games. Upset wins for the Nets and Knicks would give us a chance to get sole possession of 7th but chances of that aren't high.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Wizards (42-35) 104

Rockets (62-15) 120

Wizards lose again and are tied for the worst playoff record. They are not looking good but if they turned it around still could tie or pass the Pelicans, 1.5 games back.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Celtics(53-23) 102

Bucks (41-36) 106

Bucks a little closer to catching the Pelicans if they make the playoffs, need to keep winning to make that happen though,

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Warriors (56-21) 111

Thunder (45-33) 107

Thunder can't take a commanding lead on the Pelicans, just 1 game ahead of them now. A win here would have made me really confident that they would stay ahead but it's still up in the air now.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Trail Blazers(48-29) 109

Mavericks (23-54) 115

This would have been an amazing win to keep our hopes of catching the Mavs alive, but we beat the Hornets to stay 3 games behind them. Now they have to beat 2 tanks and get yet another upset to have a chance to catch them and I don't know if they have the consistency for that.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Pacers (46-31) 104

Nuggets(42-35) 107

Nuggets play a nice game to get just 0.5 games behind the Pelicans. They'll need to keep it up to catch them, but all it takes is a tie to knock the Pelicans out of the playoffs. Pacers are still a safe 2.5 games ahead of the Pelicans so no harm done with their loss.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Lakers(33-43) 110

Jazz (44-33) 117

Jazz turning into one of my teams to root for in the playoffs, get another win to get up to 1.5 games ahead of the Pelicans. They look good and I like their chances to finish in front of the Pels.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Kings(25-53) 94

Suns (19-59) 97

This one pretty much takes away our chances of catching the Kings. They gave us every opportunity to pass them but we just kept winning every time we got close to them. It would take a win vs a tank and an upset to have a chance to tie them.

**Bad for tank** 

&nbsp;

Spurs (45-32) 110

Clippers(41-36) 113

Clippers get to just 1.5 games behind the Pelicans in the playoffs. They play the Pels next week and have the tiebreaker advantage, so if they can keep winning they still have a pretty good chance to force the Pelicans out of the playoffs. Spurs are only 1.5 games ahead of the Pelicans now though, so we need them to get back to winning.

**(mostly) Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games** 

&nbsp;

76ers (47-30) vs Pistons (37-40)

Spread: 76ers -3.0

76ers have a commanding lead on the Pelicans, but the Pistons don't matter so root for an even bigger lead.

**Go 76ers!**

&nbsp;

Mavericks (24-54) vs Magic (23-54)

Spread: Magic -4.0

Bulls have a very very small chance of catching the Mavericks, but an even smaller chance of catching the Magic so root for Mavs. DOn't waste too much energy though we likely aren't catching either of them.

**Go Mavericks!**

&nbsp;

Heat (42-36) vs Hawks (22-56) 

Spread: Heat -8.0

Hawks are out of reach and Heat could still finish tied or ahead of the Pelicans.

**Go Heat!**

&nbsp;

Celtics (53-24) vs Raptors (55-22)

Spread: Raptors -7.5

Whoever you want as 1 seed in the East here, take your pick.

**Doesn't affect either pick**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (21-56) vs Pelicans (43-34)

Spread: Pelicans -13.0

Pelicans probably have an easy win here, but the Grizzlies just had back to back upsets against playoff teams last week so it's possible again here. Pelicans are on a 4 game losing streak and if they lost again tonight they would be tied for the 8th seed with the Nuggets. Nuggets own the tiebreaker so a loss here puts them out of the playoffs. 

**Go Grizzlies!**

&nbsp;

Spurs (45-33) vs Lakers (33-44)

Spread: Spurs -6.5

Spurs lead over the Pelicans is still in jeopardy, need more wins to secure their place ahead of Pels in the West.

**Go Spurs!**

* Bulls are currently tied for 8th in the lottery standings

* Bulls are 2 game behind of the Nets for the 7th spot and 2.5 games behind the Kings for the 6th spot

* Pelicans have the 18th spot in the draft 

* Pelicans are 0.5 games ahead of the Nuggets and 1.5 games ahead of the Clippers for the last playoff spot in the West","Tank Watch: April 4th, 2018 *I'll update with more summaries when I have more time later

Just a week ago we were on a 7 game losing streak and our tank was looking very good. Since then we've won all 3 of our games and we're back to fighting just to get the 8th spot back. Just for some perspective, if we lose those 3 games instead and change nothing else, we are currently tied for the 4th lottery spot right now. On top of our win, the Knicks also lost the easiest of their last 5 games to tie us for 8th. The only thing to salvage from yesterday was both the Clippers and Nuggets winning, which increases the chances one of them can force the Pelicans out of the playoffs.

Today is pretty light, with only 2 games that really matter. Pelicans could fall out of the playoffs with a loss today, but they play the Grizzlies so it's a long shot to say the least. Spurs are only 1.5 games ahead of the Pelicans and can stay ahead vs the Lakers today. Mavs pulled an awesome upset last night and play the Magic today, but we pretty much ruined any chance at them by beating the Hornets. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Raptors (55-21) 106

Cavaliers(47-30) 112

Not a huge deal but Cavs get a slightly bigger lead on the Pelicans. Very small chance Pels will move ahead of them.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Nets (25-52) 95

76ers(46-30) 121

Nets can't pull another upset and we're 2 games back of them now. We're going to need them to beat us twice just to be able to tie them now. It's a long shot but if they are able to get just 1 more upset over the Bucks or Celtics then we could still pass them.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Hawks(22-55) 98

Heat (41-36) 101

If the Nuggets and Clippers fail to kick the Pelicans out of the playoffs, Heat could still tie or pass the Pelicans to help us.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Magic (22-54) 97

Knicks(27-50) 73

Magic picked the worst game to destroy their opponent. Knicks tie us up at the 8th spot now and now they don't play another tank the rest of the season. It's hard to see them getting another win, but if we are going to finish ahead of us they're going to have to. I honestly just hope that we don't finish in 9th spot now, if we can just manage to tie for 8th or 7th that would be a blessing at this point.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Hornets(34-44) 114

Bulls (26-51) 120

Another great game for Markkanen, which is awesome. The problem is we take him out in the 4th and these teams still can't beat the guys that might not even be on our bench in a year or two. It's a great sign at how well Holberg's offense is working, but damn we just need to turn a few of these wins into losses and we can be picking a franchise-changing player.

With our schedule vs the rest of the tanks, the most likely result now is that we end the season with sole possession of the 9th lottery spot. The only way to avoid that fate is to lose back to back to the Nets, that would put us in a 3 way tie for 7th, if none of the teams won any of their other games. Upset wins for the Nets and Knicks would give us a chance to get sole possession of 7th but chances of that aren't high.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Wizards (42-35) 104

Rockets (62-15) 120

Wizards lose again and are tied for the worst playoff record. They are not looking good but if they turned it around still could tie or pass the Pelicans, 1.5 games back.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Celtics(53-23) 102

Bucks (41-36) 106

Bucks a little closer to catching the Pelicans if they make the playoffs, need to keep winning to make that happen though,

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Warriors (56-21) 111

Thunder (45-33) 107

Thunder can't take a commanding lead on the Pelicans, just 1 game ahead of them now. A win here would have made me really confident that they would stay ahead but it's still up in the air now.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Trail Blazers(48-29) 109

Mavericks (23-54) 115

This would have been an amazing win to keep our hopes of catching the Mavs alive, but we beat the Hornets to stay 3 games behind them. Now they have to beat 2 tanks and get yet another upset to have a chance to catch them and I don't know if they have the consistency for that.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Pacers (46-31) 104

Nuggets(42-35) 107

Nuggets play a nice game to get just 0.5 games behind the Pelicans. They'll need to keep it up to catch them, but all it takes is a tie to knock the Pelicans out of the playoffs. Pacers are still a safe 2.5 games ahead of the Pelicans so no harm done with their loss.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Lakers(33-43) 110

Jazz (44-33) 117

Jazz turning into one of my teams to root for in the playoffs, get another win to get up to 1.5 games ahead of the Pelicans. They look good and I like their chances to finish in front of the Pels.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Kings(25-53) 94

Suns (19-59) 97

This one pretty much takes away our chances of catching the Kings. They gave us every opportunity to pass them but we just kept winning every time we got close to them. It would take a win vs a tank and an upset to have a chance to tie them.

**Bad for tank** 

&nbsp;

Spurs (45-32) 110

Clippers(41-36) 113

Clippers get to just 1.5 games behind the Pelicans in the playoffs. They play the Pels next week and have the tiebreaker advantage, so if they can keep winning they still have a pretty good chance to force the Pelicans out of the playoffs. Spurs are only 1.5 games ahead of the Pelicans now though, so we need them to get back to winning.

**(mostly) Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games** 

&nbsp;

76ers (47-30) vs Pistons (37-40)

Spread: 76ers -3.0

76ers have a commanding lead on the Pelicans, but the Pistons don't matter so root for an even bigger lead.

**Go 76ers!**

&nbsp;

Mavericks (24-54) vs Magic (23-54)

Spread: Magic -4.0

Bulls have a very very small chance of catching the Mavericks, but an even smaller chance of catching the Magic so root for Mavs. DOn't waste too much energy though we likely aren't catching either of them.

**Go Mavericks!**

&nbsp;

Heat (42-36) vs Hawks (22-56) 

Spread: Heat -8.0

Hawks are out of reach and Heat could still finish tied or ahead of the Pelicans.

**Go Heat!**

&nbsp;

Celtics (53-24) vs Raptors (55-22)

Spread: Raptors -7.5

Whoever you want as 1 seed in the East here, take your pick.

**Doesn't affect either pick**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (21-56) vs Pelicans (43-34)

Spread: Pelicans -13.0

Pelicans probably have an easy win here, but the Grizzlies just had back to back upsets against playoff teams last week so it's possible again here. Pelicans are on a 4 game losing streak and if they lost again tonight they would be tied for the 8th seed with the Nuggets. Nuggets own the tiebreaker so a loss here puts them out of the playoffs. 

**Go Grizzlies!**

&nbsp;

Spurs (45-33) vs Lakers (33-44)

Spread: Spurs -6.5

Spurs lead over the Pelicans is still in jeopardy, need more wins to secure their place ahead of Pels in the West.

**Go Spurs!**

"Hello fellow Chicago fans! I live in a small town a few hours away in Indiana and this Saturday, I will be surprising my Dad by driving him to Chicago and taking him to see the Bulls for our first professional sports game for 90’s night, against the Brooklyn Nets! This a really special day for me, we’ve always talked about going out to Chicago together! I’ve been to Chicago a few times with friends, but I haven’t had the chance to go with my Dad yet. The thought had popped in my head last week as I realized the end of the season was approaching, so I grabbed some tickets. We’ll be getting into Chicago a little early Saturday, and I wanted to hopefully treat my dad to a great experience and go out and see some things we don’t see in our little city. 

With that being said I was hoping I could maybe ask you guys for some suggestions and your favorite things to go do/places to see/places to eat!!!

Maybe if I throw in some of our interests could you guys suggest some things you know? My dad is a sports fan, Football/Baseball/Basketball, so maybe any kind of sports museums or anything? He’s also a BIG sports card collector, so I’d love to take him to a card shop. We also bond over vinyl records and we collect those so I’d like to take him to a record store. Other than that could you guys name some things you think we should check out???

I would appreciate your feedback and answers so much!!!

Also does anyone know what we can expect out of 90’s night? (I’m a big 90’s bulls fan)

And where can I randomly bump into Chance The Rapper? 😂😂

Thanks for reading, God bless!","Father/Son First Bulls Game!!! Hello fellow Chicago fans!

"**Kevin Knox**- 6'9"" 205 pounds. Likely position: SF, small ball PF. Knox will likely be taken before the pelicans pick but enough draft boards have him falling around the 15 spot that I decided to include him. Knox is only 18 years old and has a lot of offensive upside. He can finish well around the rim, has some shot creating ability but this will still need a lot of development, off the ball hes a smart scorer who knows when to cut and how to take advantage of closeouts. He has the physical tools to be a great wing defender although he failed to use them well in college. On the downside, hes incredibly raw, his overall decision making needs work and his perimeter shooting was average at the college level. He also lacked defensive toughness and would sometimes not give effort on that end. Interesting upside but most likely a role player.

**Anfernee Simons**- 6'4"" Likely Position: SG, small ball SF. Great all around 2 guard scorer with shooting, ball handling and athleticism and could be a very high upside pick. He also has defensive potential but its hard to tell if it will translate. Bigger risk since he hasnt played college ball and its harder to tell how his game will translates to the next level. Doesn't have the distributing ability to be a point guard and is more likely a sg. This creates some issues since he may not have the body to guard nba wings on switches. Might be a case of talent duplication as we already have lavine whos a ball dominant scoring guard. Overall a high upside scorer whos more risky since he didnt play college ball.

**Keita Bates-Diop**- 6'7"" 235 pounds Likely Position: SF, small ball PF. Potential to be a solid 3 and D wing player if he shows that he can better use his defensive tools than he did in college. His shot looks like it will translate to the NBA. Should be able to run the floor and finish well in transition. Solid post player who can post up or face up with skill. On the downside, hes not super athletic, lacks a good first step or the ball handling to create from the perimeter and can sometimes not put in effort on the defensive end. He also may not have the quickness to switch onto faster guards and guard them at an elite level. He's also an older prospect at 22. Overall, he projects as a solid 3 and D role player who will need to hone his defensive focus to become an elite role player, and is a higher floor, lower upside player. 

**Robert Williams**- 6'10"" 241 pounds Likely Position: Center. Incredibly athletic center with the potential to be a defensive anchor. Solid passing from the post, faster big man who may be able to hold his own if switched onto guards or wings. Excellent shot blocker and help defender who can be a rim protector that anchors a good defense. His athleticism makes him a great pick and roll center who can catch lobs for days. On the downside, his shot is nowhere near ready to be effective at the NBA level. His one on one defense in the post needs work and he could struggle against more skilled post scoring big men. Doesnt have the skills to be anything other than a roll man on the offensive end. His rebounding is not elite for someone of his size. Overall he projects as a solid pick and roll center who has the upside to be a defensive anchor. 

**Lonnie Walker**- 6'4"" 192 pounds Likely Position: SG. A 3 and D shooting guard who has the potential to be an all around scorer and defensive stopper. His main selling point is his 3 point shooting ability, he can pull up after crossing half court or come off screens to be a catch and shoot player. Has the ability to attack on closeouts and finish around the rim with floaters and layups. Has shown great defensive ability and should be able to be a solid defender at positions 1-3. On the downside, he needs to improve his shot creating to become a go to scorer and isnt much of a passer. He's also not big enough to switch onto nba 4s or 5s defensively. Overall he's a high upside 3 and D wing who could be a steal if he can improve his shot creating enough to be a primary scoring option.

**Mitchell Robinson**- 6'11"" 215 pounds. Likely Position: Center. Incredibly athletic, fast and long center with a 7'4"" wingspan. He looks like he has all the tools to be a defensive anchor and explosive rim running center. That said, he's a big risk as he didn't play in college. It's hard to tell what his skill level will be and if he'll even be a serviceable center at the NBA level despite being a 5 star recruit out of college, but his physical tools are enticing and make him a high upside pick with perhaps the most risk of anyone in the draft. 

**Dzanan Musa**- 6'9"" 195 pounds. Likely Position: SF and PG in some lineups. The next best European prospect after Luka Doncic. He can score on all three levels, hes a good perimeter shooter, has a decent midrange game and can create off the bounce and get to the rim. He's a decent athlete, at the very least average for the NBA level. High basketball IQ and is great as a pick and roll ball handler. He's also a decent passer which makes him versatile as he can be a point forward and can play positions 1-3. On the other hand, he needs to improve as a finisher to truly be a go to scorer, and his athleticism is not elite. He struggles defensively at times and this may especially be an issue at the NBA level against more athletic and explosive wings, although when he's locked in he can be a solid defender but won't lock down elite players. Needs to improve off the ball in catch and shoot situations and cutting. Overall he's another high upside player who could be a great scorer in the NBA but his defense and finishing makes it risky. 

**Zhaire Smith**- 6'5"" 195 pounds. Likely Position: SF. Great defensive prospect with incredible athleticism and the versatility to guard positions 1-3 at a high level and the length to clog passing lanes and create turnovers. Plays very well off the ball as he can shoot, is a good cutter and is a great finisher when getting the ball while going to the rim. He's shooting 45% from 3 but its on low volume. His athleticism creates a lot of upside offensively. On the downside, his shot creating ability is far from where it needs to be in order for him to be truly effective at the offensive end, most of his points come off the ball. His ability to shoot consistently from the 3 point line is also theoretical, his mechanics are questionable and he's a reluctant shooter. 

**Shai Gilgeous-Alexander** 6'6"" 171 pounds. Likely Position: PG. All around point guard, with great defense, a lot of length and solid playmaking. He has the ability to lock down guards on the perimeter and clog passing lanes and create turnovers. Good at running the pick and roll. Has a decent jumper. On the downside, he can sometimes be turnover prone, his mechanics may make it difficult for his shot to translate to the NBA as its already not great at the college level. This would be another case of talent duplication if we took him, he has a lot of the same strengths and weaknesses as Kris Dunn, that said he's 19 years old, 6'6"" and could be an interesting gamble if he falls to us. 

**Khyri Thomas**- 6'3"" 210 pounds. Likely Position: SG or PG in some lineups. Excellent 3 and D prospect who has a great shooting stroke, can create from the perimeter with ball handling and can score at all three levels of the floor with the shooting stroke to score from midrange or outside and decent finishing around the rim. 2 time Big East Defensive Player of the Year. Has a 6'10"" wingspan which gives him some versatility despite his size and allows him to create a lot of turnovers in passing lanes. On the downside, he's not much of a facilitator which locks him into the 2 guard spot in most lineups. He's also an older prospect at 21 and his scoring ability is somewhat theoretical as he's averaging 15 ppg at Creighton and looks passive and more of a catch and shoot player at times. Should be a solid role player at the 2 guard spot at least. 

**Chandler Hutchinson**- 6'7"" 197 pounds. Likely Position: SF, small ball PF. Hutchinson is an excellent scorer at the college level and relies mostly on his slashing ability. He can score out of isolation or the pick and roll, and can finish at the rim. He also has a decent jumpshot and an definitely stroke it from 3 but its an improvement made this year and the sample size may be too small to be sure of his ability to shoot from outside. He's also a good passer at the 3 position and does a decent job of facilitating the offense at times. However, he struggles when it comes to shooting off the dribble which can be a problem against NBA wing defenders who make it harder to get to the rim, and he hasn't shown enough on defense to stand out as a 3 and D prospect. If he plays the role of a small ball 4 he'll definitely struggle defensively from that position as well. Overall he's another high upside player who could potentially be an excellent scorer at the next level but isn't the type of 3 and D wing that the bulls need. 

If there's anyone I left off the list let me know and I'll try to add them. For now, this seemed like a list of players that would be good considering either their upside or their fit on our roster going forward. 
","A look at some of the prospects we can take with the pelicans pick **Kevin Knox**- 6'9"" 205 pounds. Likely position: SF, small ball PF.

On the downside, he needs to improve his shot creating to become a go to scorer and isnt much of a passer. He's also not big enough to switch onto nba 4s or 5s defensively. Overall he's a high upside 3 and D wing who could be a steal if he can improve his shot creating enough to be a primary scoring option.

He can score on all three levels, hes a good perimeter shooter, has a decent midrange game and can create off the bounce and get to the rim. He's a decent athlete, at the very least average for the NBA level. High basketball IQ and is great as a pick and roll ball handler. He's also a decent passer which makes him versatile as he can be a point forward and can play positions 1-3. On the other hand, he needs to improve as a finisher to truly be a go to scorer, and his athleticism is not elite. He struggles defensively at times and this may especially be an issue at the NBA level against more athletic and explosive wings, although when he's locked in he can be a solid defender but won't lock down elite players. Needs to improve off the ball in catch and shoot situations and cutting. Overall he's another high upside player who could be a great scorer in the NBA but his defense and finishing makes it risky. 

**Zhaire Smith**- 6'5"" 195 pounds. Likely Position: SF. Great defensive prospect with incredible athleticism and the versatility to guard positions 1-3 at a high level and the length to clog passing lanes and create turnovers. Plays very well off the ball as he can shoot, is a good cutter and is a great finisher when getting the ball while going to the rim. He's shooting 45% from 3 but its on low volume. His athleticism creates a lot of upside offensively. On the downside, his shot creating ability is far from where it needs to be in order for him to be truly effective at the offensive end, most of his points come off the ball. His ability to shoot consistently from the 3 point line is also theoretical, his mechanics are questionable and he's a reluctant shooter. 

**Shai Gilgeous-Alexander** 6'6"" 171 pounds. Likely Position: PG. All around point guard, with great defense, a lot of length and solid playmaking. He has the ability to lock down guards on the perimeter and clog passing lanes and create turnovers. Good at running the pick and roll. Has a decent jumper. On the downside, he can sometimes be turnover prone, his mechanics may make it difficult for his shot to translate to the NBA as its already not great at the college level. This would be another case of talent duplication if we took him, he has a lot of the same strengths and weaknesses as Kris Dunn, that said he's 19 years old, 6'6"" and could be an interesting gamble if he falls to us. 

**Khyri Thomas**- 6'3"" 210 pounds. Likely Position: SG or PG in some lineups. Excellent 3 and D prospect who has a great shooting stroke, can create from the perimeter with ball handling and can score at all three levels of the floor with the shooting stroke to score from midrange or outside and decent finishing around the rim. 2 time Big East Defensive Player of the Year. Has a 6'10"" wingspan which gives him some versatility despite his size and allows him to create a lot of turnovers in passing lanes. On the downside, he's not much of a facilitator which locks him into the 2 guard spot in most lineups. He's also an older prospect at 21 and his scoring ability is somewhat theoretical as he's averaging 15 ppg at Creighton and looks passive and more of a catch and shoot player at times. Should be a solid role player at the 2 guard spot at least. 

**Chandler Hutchinson**- 6'7"" 197 pounds. Likely Position: SF, small ball PF. Hutchinson is an excellent scorer at the college level and relies mostly on his slashing ability. He can score out of isolation or the pick and roll, and can finish at the rim. He also has a decent jumpshot and an definitely stroke it from 3 but its an improvement made this year and the sample size may be too small to be sure of his ability to shoot from outside. He's also a good passer at the 3 position and does a decent job of facilitating the offense at times. However, he struggles when it comes to shooting off the dribble which can be a problem against NBA wing defenders who make it harder to get to the rim, and he hasn't shown enough on defense to stand out as a 3 and D prospect. If he plays the role of a small ball 4 he'll definitely struggle defensively from that position as well. Overall he's another high upside player who could potentially be an excellent scorer at the next level but isn't the type of 3 and D wing that the bulls need. 

If there's anyone I left off the list let me know and I'll try to add them. For now, this seemed like a list of players that would be good considering either their upside or their fit on our roster going forward.

"No games yesterday as Villanova took down Michigan to win the National Championship. Bridges wasn't the biggest star of the game but he put together another good game to help his draft stock. Now that the college season is over it will be interesting to see what changes with draft projections.

Today there are another 13 games, with lots of important ones for the tank. We have our game against the Hornets that we need to lose, won't be a walk in the park but hopefully our depth guys will be less hot today. Kings and Knicks both play tanks today and we really need those wins from them. Kings are 1 win better than us and Knicks are 1 win worse. The only other tank that still matters to us (Nets) also plays today but they're up against the 76ers. There are also plenty of Pelicans rivals that we can root for today too.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

(3) Michigan 62

(1) Villanova 79


Bridges started slow on offense but showed off his 3 ball in the second half and finished with 19. He was overshadowed a bit by DiVincenzo but he was the only other Wildcat with 10+ points and definitely improved his draft stock once again. 

**Good for Bridges**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games** 

&nbsp;

Raptors (55-21) vs Cavaliers (47-30)

Spread: Cavaliers -1.0

Cavaliers are a very healthy 4 games in front of the Pelicans so we don't really need to worry about them anymore, technically they help us more than the Raptors do though but don't lose any sleep over this game.

**Go Cavaliers!**

&nbsp;

Nets (25-52) vs 76ers (46-30)

Spread: 76ers -7.5

76ers have been insanely good lately, but they are without Embiid now, making them a lot more vulnerable to an upset. Nets are back to a game in front of us and we could really use some help from them before our 2 games next week.

**Go Nets!**

&nbsp;

Hawks (22-55) vs Heat (41-36) 

Spread: Heat -12.0

Hawks are definitely out of reach for the Bulls. Heat are 2 games behind the Pelicans and could tie/pass them to help us if they Pelicans make the playoffs. If the Pelicans fall that far though they will probably be out of the playoffs anyways, but might as well cover all our bases since that's more likely than the Hawks winning out.

**Go Heat!**

&nbsp;

Magic (22-54) vs Knicks (27-50)

Spread: Knicks -1.5

I was hoping to be rooting for the Magic in this one, because that would have meant the Bulls are still able to catch them. Instead, Magic are now out of reach and the Knicks are back to being hot on our tail. We could really really use the win from the Knicks to give us a game of space here, because after this game the Knicks don't play another tank. If the Knicks lose this one the Bulls would almost definitely have to lose out to stay ahead of them. Luckily the Magic have been absolutely terrible lately. They better keep that up today.

**Go Knicks!**

&nbsp;

Hornets (34-44) vs Bulls (26-51)

Spread: Hornets -4.5

Hornets are definitely the better team, but the Bulls are still dangerous as we saw against the Wizards. We are sitting Dunn and Lavine the rest of the year, so it will be a lot of the lineup we've been running lately. All thats left before the Nets games is this and the Celtics. We absolutely have to lose those games and then finish with a loss to the Pistons. Nets games will be what they'll be but we have to give ourselves a chance with those games by losing the other ones.

**Go Hornets!**

&nbsp;

Wizards (42-35) vs Rockets (62-15)

Spread: Rockets -7.5

Wizards screwed us bad the other day by losing to us, and now we're hoping they beat the Rockets. They'll have Wall back so that's a plus, and the Rockets aren't playing for anything anymore. Wizards are 1 game behind the Pelicans in case they make the playoffs, so tying them up at the very least would help us out.

**Go Wizards!**

&nbsp;

Celtics (53-23) vs Bucks (41-36)

Spread: Bucks -2.0

Like the Heat, if the Bucks catch the Pelicans then it probably doesn't matter because the Pels would be out of the playoffs anyways. However, also like the Heat, Bucks play a team that is even less important to us so might as well root for them.

**Go Bucks!**

&nbsp;

Warriors (56-21) vs Thunder (45-33) 

Spread: Thunder -4.5

Thunder helped a ton with their clutch win against the Pelicans Sunday. They are still just 1.5 games ahead of the Pels now so they need to keep it rolling against the Warriors.

**Go Thunder!**

&nbsp;

Trail Blazers (48-29) vs Mavericks (23-54)

Spread: Trail Blazers -8.5

Mavericks are 3 games ahead of us and we probably won't be catching them anymore. If they were to manage an upset here though (or agains the Pistons or 76ers) then they could still tie us by beating the Magic and Suns. It's not likely but it's definitely possible. Trail Blazers are a full 5 games ahead of the Pelicans now so we don't need them to win anymore.

**Go Mavericks!**

&nbsp;

Pacers (46-31) vs Nuggets (42-35)

Spread: Nuggets -3.5

Nuggets are only a game back and could make some more progress today. As long as the other teams can stay in front of the Pelicans, the Nuggets could be the teams to knock them out of the playoffs. Pacers are 3 games ahead of the Pelicans right now. That is lead is probably safe, but if the Nuggets can't pull off the win it would be a little bit of insurance for the Pacers.

**Go Nuggets!**

&nbsp;

Lakers (33-43) vs Jazz (44-33) 

Spread: Jazz -11.0

Jazz finally took the lead on the Pelicans and I like their chances of staying ahead if they keep playing the way they have. You never really know what to expect from the Lakers but they did just get beat (and held under 85 points) by the Kings so lets hope they play that way again.

**Go Jazz!**

&nbsp;

Kings (25-53) vs Suns (19-59)

Spread: not listed yet

Kings only have 4 games remaining: They play the Suns and Grizzlies and then finish against the Rockets and Spurs. These next two games are the opportunity the Bulls need to be able to tie or pass them. Kings are most definitely better than the Suns and we need them to come out with their best today. Suns have actually been a little better lately, playing some good teams awfully close. Let's hope they bring the best of their tank today.

**Go Kings!** 

&nbsp;

Spurs (45-32) vs Clippers (41-36)

Spread: Spurs -1.5

Both teams would help the Bulls with a win, with the Spurs being 2 games ahead of the Pelicans and the Clippers 2 games behind. Edge goes to the Clippers because they have the opportunity to knock the Pelicans out of the playoffs. Spurs win wouldn't be bad either though with the bigger cushion from being passed by the Pels.

**Go Clippers!**

Instead, Magic are now out of reach and the Knicks are back to being hot on our tail. We could really really use the win from the Knicks to give us a game of space here, because after this game the Knicks don't play another tank. If the Knicks lose this one the Bulls would almost definitely have to lose out to stay ahead of them. Luckily the Magic have been absolutely terrible lately. They better keep that up today.

**Go Knicks!**

&nbsp;

Hornets (34-44) vs Bulls (26-51)

Spread: Hornets -4.5

Hornets are definitely the better team, but the Bulls are still dangerous as we saw against the Wizards. We are sitting Dunn and Lavine the rest of the year, so it will be a lot of the lineup we've been running lately. All thats left before the Nets games is this and the Celtics. We absolutely have to lose those games and then finish with a loss to the Pistons. Nets games will be what they'll be but we have to give ourselves a chance with those games by losing the other ones.

**Go Hornets!**

&nbsp;

Wizards (42-35) vs Rockets (62-15)

Spread: Rockets -7.5

Wizards screwed us bad the other day by losing to us, and now we're hoping they beat the Rockets. They'll have Wall back so that's a plus, and the Rockets aren't playing for anything anymore. Wizards are 1 game behind the Pelicans in case they make the playoffs, so tying them up at the very least would help us out.

**Go Wizards!**

&nbsp;

Celtics (53-23) vs Bucks (41-36)

Spread: Bucks -2.0

Like the Heat, if the Bucks catch the Pelicans then it probably doesn't matter because the Pels would be out of the playoffs anyways. However, also like the Heat, Bucks play a team that is even less important to us so might as well root for them.

**Go Bucks!**

&nbsp;

Warriors (56-21) vs Thunder (45-33) 

Spread: Thunder -4.5

Thunder helped a ton with their clutch win against the Pelicans Sunday. They are still just 1.5 games ahead of the Pels now so they need to keep it rolling against the Warriors.

**Go Thunder!**

&nbsp;

Trail Blazers (48-29) vs Mavericks (23-54)

Spread: Trail Blazers -8.5

Mavericks are 3 games ahead of us and we probably won't be catching them anymore. If they were to manage an upset here though (or agains the Pistons or 76ers) then they could still tie us by beating the Magic and Suns. It's not likely but it's definitely possible. Trail Blazers are a full 5 games ahead of the Pelicans now so we don't need them to win anymore.

**Go Mavericks!**

&nbsp;

Pacers (46-31) vs Nuggets (42-35)

Spread: Nuggets -3.5

Nuggets are only a game back and could make some more progress today. As long as the other teams can stay in front of the Pelicans, the Nuggets could be the teams to knock them out of the playoffs. Pacers are 3 games ahead of the Pelicans right now. That is lead is probably safe, but if the Nuggets can't pull off the win it would be a little bit of insurance for the Pacers.

**Go Nuggets!**

&nbsp;

Lakers (33-43) vs Jazz (44-33) 

Spread: Jazz -11.0

Jazz finally took the lead on the Pelicans and I like their chances of staying ahead if they keep playing the way they have. You never really know what to expect from the Lakers but they did just get beat (and held under 85 points) by the Kings so lets hope they play that way again.

**Go Jazz!**

&nbsp;

Kings (25-53) vs Suns (19-59)

Spread: not listed yet

Kings only have 4 games remaining: They play the Suns and Grizzlies and then finish against the Rockets and Spurs. These next two games are the opportunity the Bulls need to be able to tie or pass them. Kings are most definitely better than the Suns and we need them to come out with their best today. Suns have actually been a little better lately, playing some good teams awfully close. Let's hope they bring the best of their tank today.

**Go Kings!** 

&nbsp;

Spurs (45-32) vs Clippers (41-36)

Spread: Spurs -1.5

Both teams would help the Bulls with a win, with the Spurs being 2 games ahead of the Pelicans and the Clippers 2 games behind. Edge goes to the Clippers because they have the opportunity to knock the Pelicans out of the playoffs. Spurs win wouldn't be bad either though with the bigger cushion from being passed by the Pels.

**Go Clippers!**

A lot of the games went well for us yesterday, but we ruined any progress we could have made by thrashing the Wizards. It pretty much takes away any chance we had at a top 5 lottery spot, and puts us back in sole possession of 8th. On the bright side: the Kings pulled an upset to keep our chances of passing/tying them alive. The Pelicans lost to the Thunder to increase their chances of missing the playoffs. Lots of teams that are ahead of the Pelicans won, keeping the Pelicans lower among playoff teams in case they still make it.

Today there are no NBA games, so just enjoy the National Championship. Tomorrow is a really huge day for our pick so get ready.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

76ers (45-30) 119

Hornets(34-43) 102

76ers win puts them 3.5 games ahead of the Pelicans and they will almost definitely stay ahead of the Pelicans for the rest of the season, one more team we don't really need to worry about anymore.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Wizards(42-34) 94

Bulls (25-51) 113

Even without Lauri balling out we probably still would have won this one. The Wizards just didn't play very good defense and we shot really well, especially from 3. It's great to see Lauri score 23 in just 24 minutes and to see Bobby get 18 in just 15 minutes. They were great and lead an a very uninspiring roster to a win over a playoff team. I can't ever be mad at our good players for playing well, so I'll just get mad at the Wizards instead for not scoring more and for letting Kilpatrick get 14 points.

This was an unexpected loss that hurts the tank in a lot of different ways. It pretty much puts the previously catchable Mavericks and Magic out of reach, the very best we can hope for now is 6th. It puts us back to 1 game behind the Nets and 1.5 games behind the Kings when we could have been tied for 7th with the Nets and just 0.5 games behind the Kings. Probably the scariest, our win puts us only 1 game ahead of the Knicks. Any more of these upsets and we could drop back to 9th. 

**Bad for tank, Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Rockets(62-14) 83

Spurs (44-32) 100

Spurs get a really nice win to put them up 2 games on the Pelicans. I didn't see the game but I'm assuming Rockets rested some guys since they clinched all they want to. Spurs finish the season against the Pelicans, so a bigger cushion would be really nice over the next few games. 

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Pacers (45-31) 111

Clippers(41-35) 104

Clippers just can't get the crucial wins lately. The Pelicans are on a 4 game losing streak now but the Clippers are still 2 games behind them. They can make up 1 game when they play the Pelicans, but they need to outplay the Pelicans by 1 more game to be able to tie them and force them out of the playoffs (Clippers win tiebreaker). This one is not all bad though, as the Pacers are able to take a commanding 3 game lead on the Pelicans. If the Pelicans still make the playoffs that is one less team they can finish ahead of. 

**(mostly) Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Magic (22-53) 88

Hawks(21-55) 94

If the Bulls had lost, this game would have been bad since the Magic would be more out of reach for us. Since we won yesterday though, the Magic are out of reach anyways so no big deal here. Damn are the Magic bad though, they better stay bad against the Knicks.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Pistons(36-40) 108

Nets (25-51) 96

Nets just pulled an overtime upset the previous night so it's hard to ask for another one here. Nets made a bit of a run in the second half to make it pretty close, but the Pistons held on for the win. Nets play the 76ers and Bucks next so we gotta hope they have another upset in them so the Bulls can enter the double header tied instead of behind.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Mavericks(23-53) 87

Cavaliers (46-30) 98

Mavericks actually lead for most of the game before the Cavaliers pulled away in the 4th. If the Mavericks could have pulled it off the Bulls might still be in contention to catch them. With the loss the Mavs are now 3 games ahead of us, and it would take 3 wins over their last 5 to even have a chance to tie them. Maybe they pull an upset and beat the 2 tanks they play but it's a slim chance.

**Bad for tank, Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Thunder (44-33) 109

Pelicans (43-33) 104

Great game that does a lot for our second pick. The Thunder take a 1.5 game lead over the Pelicans instead of slipping behind them, Nuggets are able to gain a game to possibly knock the Pelicans out of the playoffs, other teams get a bigger lead on the Pelicans. This one was close for most of the game, but the Thunder outlasted the Pels to extend the Pelicans losing streak to 4.

**Good for Pelicans pick x2**

&nbsp;

Jazz (43-33) 121

Wolves(44-33) 97

Jazz are able to pass the Pelicans, and also leapfrog the Timberwolves in the process. I like the Jazz going ahead because I'm confident they'll be able to stay ahead. Timberwolves I'm not so sure about, but they are still ahead of the Pelicans by 0.5 games. Wolves are a huge priority for us now, need to get those wins.

**Neutral for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Bucks (41-35) 125

Nuggets(41-35) 128

Nuggets win it in overtime and are now just 1 game out of the playoffs. They win the tiebreaker with the Pelicans, so they just need to outplay the Pelicans by 1 game to knock them out of the playoffs. 

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Suns (19-58) 107

Warriors(55-21) 117

Doesn't affect our picks, Suns play another top team really close though.

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies(21-55) 98

Blazers (47-29) 113

Trail Blazers increase their lead over the Pelicans to 5 games and can't get passed my the Pels anymore. We don't even need to root for them anymore except when they play the Pelicans.

**Good for Pelicans pick** 

&nbsp;

Kings (24-53) 84

Lakers(33-42) 83

Kings somehow limit the fast-paced Lakers offense to just 83 points to get the win. It would have been even easier to enjoy if the Bulls had lost and entered a virtual tie with the Kings and Nets, but it's still very huge that the Kings won because we are still just 1 win ahead of them and can make that up when the Kings play the Suns and Grizzlies.

I'm sure all of you guys have seen some of him by now, but this is a great chance to see his strengths and weaknesses in game with the highest pressure. If you haven't been able to see too many full games of his, take some time to focus on him when he's on the court. Watch for some of the things that you can't see from highlights like his perimeter defense, defensive help, shot selection, ball movement, etc. It will be especially nice to see how he plays on offense against a good defense like Michigan.

"The Pelicans are doing a magnificent job tanking for our pick, than us.


After that recent loss they suffered against OKC, they are back at 8th spot in the west.


Should have been tied with the Wiz, if we did our part lossing to the Wiz earlier. Right now the pick is 18th, which could have been 17th and a game away from being 16th.


&nbsp;

Update**: 


#Nuggets playoff race


With Nuggets come from behind win againts the Bucks, they are a game away from eliminating the Pelicans.


Nuggets have the edge against the Pels in head-to-head match-up, in case they end up with a tie. Nuggets won two out of three games in their season match-up.


Nuggets will still face the Pacers, Clippers, Trailblazers and the Wolves twice.


Which gives me hope that they will win 4 out of those 5 games.


On the other hand, I hope the Pelicans would lose to GSW and Spurs, as the Clips game is most likely a win for them. Add the two free wins they'll have against Grizz and Suns, the Pels definitely have the leverage in this playoff race. If Griz comes out winning that game against the Pels, then I will hate the Griz no more :) ","At least the Pelicans are giving me hope of a higher pick...

"I’m a Chicago Bulls fan from the UK and I try my best to watch bulls games that start before 2:00 am. 

I love this team, there’s no other way to put it. 

I knew this would be a tanking season as I’m sure many of you did, but, knowing our history of management I was sceptical at first as I was confident we’d find a way to mess it up. 

From the Jimmy trade (which was a win-win) we got Markkanen who is undoubtedly a great young player, who I hope proves me wrong, but I believe his ceiling is that of an all star. Not a franchise player (Lebron, Anthony Davis, Giannis etc). Kris Dunn who is a promising young point guard who will become a starting calibre player, and Zach Lavine who has been way too inconsistent this season for me to make a well informed opinion on, though should become a starting piece minimum, but again, like Lauri, he’s not a franchise player.

Anyway when we started the season awfully I was full of hope we’d be able to draft a franchise player, there a 3 prospects in this draft that have superstar potential. These players are MPJ, Doncic and Ayton. Period. 

Plus the Pels pick(which we didn’t know was ours at the time) we’d have one of the most promising young rosters in the league.

This could fill in our holes at SF/C, with at least one of these positions having a player with franchise potential which would take us over the edge in 5 or so years.

But then Mirotic happened, and that was the beginning of the end. Since then our season has gone downhill, even after offloading him for a first round pick (which was a great trade IMO) we’ve been winning games far too regularly.

As much as I love the emergence of players such as Bobby Portis and Valentine off the bench, it may have done us more harm than good in the long run.

It’s devastating that every time we’re close to over taking a team in the lottery standings, we face a huge setback such as tonight. 

And the thing that gets me angrier than anything else are fans who’re having a go at tank supporters when they’re happy with a loss.
As well as the fact that Adam Silver is calling out the Bulls, even though there are several teams (Suns, Magic, Grizzlies, Dallas) who are tanking much more blatantly than us.

The Bulls, unless we draft a player who heavily surprises us / we luck out in the lottery are set for another 10 years of close, but not close enough competition. 

Meanwhile a franchise like the Suns, now has a young core of Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton (post 2018 draft) and J.Jackson. Not as deep as the bulls but they have much greater superstar potential. 

I’m sorry if this is long winded but I had to get this off my chest, I’m in despair after tonight, granted we really did try to lose in that 4th quarter (I mean just look at that line up). 

I’ve not been on this Reddit community long and you all seem like nice guys/gals and I appreciate our shared love of the Bulls and will continue to support this franchise passionately regardless as I’m sure you all will. Thanks for reading this.

"*This time with the correct title

Happy Easter and April Fools Day! We're back tied for 7th! Nets pulled a nice upset on the Heat and the Bulls are back tied for the 7th lottery spot. Our win against the Magic was a pretty big dent in the tank, but we still have a very good opportunity to move up a few spots from the 8th we were in for so long. No other tank teams won, but with them all being underdogs we were lucky to get the one we did.

Today is a pretty huge day for both of our picks, with 13 games total. Bulls play today, every tank we are chasing plays today, Pelicans play today, and 9 teams that are within 2 games of the Pelicans play today. For our pick we just need to lose and get maybe 1-2 wins from other tanks. For the Pelicans pick we mostly just need them to lose, as most of the teams close to them play each other today.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Hornets (34-42) 93

Wizards (41-34) 107

Wizards get Wall back and he played pretty well in a fairly easy win for them. They are now only 1 game back of the Pelicans, becoming yet another team that could improve our second draft pick. 

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Pistons(35-40) 115

Knicks (27-49) 109

Knicks played them pretty close but couldn't pull out a win. With their schedule the rest of the year, the Knicks might get 1 more win but could also easily go winless. This means the Bulls can only really afford 1 more win to stay ahead of the Knicks. 

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Raptors(55-20) 99

Celtics (52-23) 110

Celtics have a really nice win to keep their 1 seed hopes alive. Neither team will be affecting the Bulls though.

**Neither team affects pick**

&nbsp;

Nets (24-51) 110

Heat (41-35) 109

Damn was this a crazy game. Nets had their usual 4th quarter lead and then almost gave it away again, ended up holding on to force OT. Nets hit a few nice shots to take the lead in overtime and then gave the Heat like 4 chances to take the lead back in the last minute with turnovers and allowing offensive rebounds. Heat missed all their shots though and the Nets were able to pull a really key upset for us. They are once again tied with the Bulls for 7th. This is really really huge for us because now we can split our games with the Nets (not preferable but very possible) and still stay in the 7th lottery spot. Granted it might mean we're tied for 7th, but every little bit helps in the lottery, and we could also win the coin flip for the 7th pick if the lottery fails us. 

Heat probably don't catch the Pelicans anymore (now 2.5 games back) but that's not nearly as important as the Nets winning.

**Good for tank, Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Warriors(54-21) 112

Kings (24-52) 96

Warriors win it pretty easily, keeping the Kings 1.5 games ahead of the Bulls. The next 3 games for the Kings, however, are all against non-playoff teams, including the top 2 tanks. They are still a very prime candidate to tie or pass, lets hope for some good games from them this week.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games** 

(these spreads are what's listed as of 1am, I'll be only on mobile today and edits from there always screw up my format. For updated spreads check: http://www.espn.com/nba/scoreboard/_/date/20180401)

&nbsp;

76ers (45-30) vs Hornets (34-43)

Spread: not listed yet

76ers will have a harder time winning without Embiid, but they are still playing some really good basketball right now, closing in on the 3 seed in the East. They are 2.5 games ahead of the Pelicans, solid but could be better. The rest of the season they only play 2 playoff teams though so they shouldn't have too hard a time staying ahead of the Pels. 

**Go 76ers!**

&nbsp;

Wizards (42-34) vs Bulls (25-51)

Spread: not listed yet

Wizards are just 4-6 in their last 10, but they looked really good last night. The Bulls cannot afford any more wins the rest of the year if we are going to make any more forward progress. The teams ahead of us have winnable games left, but even a single loss before the Nets games really puts anything better than 7th off the table. 

**Go Wizards!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

Rockets (62-14) vs Spurs (44-32) 

Spread: not listed yet

Spurs are now a full 2 games ahead of the Pelicans but I'd prefer them to stay at that length because they end the season with a game against the Pelicans. Playing the Rockets is always tough, but they clinched home court through the playoffs yesterday so they aren't actually playing for anything anymore. Let's hope the Rockets take it easy and the Spurs get a win.

**Go Spurs!**

&nbsp;

Pacers (45-31) vs Clippers (41-35)

Spread: Clippers -3.0

Pacers are 2 games ahead of the Pelicans and the Clippers are 2 games behind. Clippers have the advantage of being able to knock the Pelicans out of the playoffs though, so they get the advantage here. Pacers win would be good to stay well ahead of the Pelicans, but the Clippers catching the Pelicans would be a much more significant improvement.  

**Go Clippers!**

&nbsp;

Magic (22-53) vs Hawks (21-55)

Spread: Hawks -2.0

As hard as it is to see us catching the Magic after that terrible game on Friday, they still have an easy enough schedule that tying them is possible. If the Magic win this game, then we just have to hope that the winner of Mavs vs Magic gets at least 1 more win. That would tie the Bulls win total and we could match them by losing out.

**Go Magic!**

&nbsp;

Pistons (36-40) vs Nets (25-51)

Spread: not listed yet

Nets pulled a great upset yesterday and now they play a worse team tonight. Pistons are decent, but can definitely be beaten if they Nets play a good game. Over the next 3 games the Nets play the Pistons, Bucks, and Embiid-less 76ers. Those are all fairly tough opponents, but the Nets definitely have a chance to win in all of them. If they could manage just 1 win in those 3 games, the Bulls could split our 2 games with the Nets and still stay a game ahead of them. This will probably be the best chance here so let's hope for the win. 

**Go Nets!**

&nbsp;

Mavericks (23-53) vs Cavaliers (46-30)

Spread: not listed yet

If the Mavericks were able to win this one and we lose to the Wizards, we would be just 1 game behind them and looking very good to pass them. More likely the Cavaliers win this, but that's not too bad either with the Cavs 3 games ahead of the Pelicans. They shouldn't have any trouble keeping that lead though.

**Go Mavericks!**

&nbsp;

Thunder (44-33) vs Pelicans (43-33) 

Spread: Thunder -1.0

Big game here with the Thunder only 0.5 games ahead. Both teams are on 3 game losing streaks and are fighting for positioning in the West. A win for Thunder would be huge to take a bigger lead on the Pelicans and give the other teams around the Pelicans a chance to move farther ahead.

**Go Thunder!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

Jazz (43-33) vs Timberwolves (44-33)

Spread: not listed yet

Jazz are tied with the Pelicans and Wolves are 0.5 games ahead so not too much variance here. Whatever happens in this game we just need both teams to finish ahead of the Pelicans. I have more faith in the Jazz to finish strong, so I think I'll root for them, but then again if the Pelicans lose more than maybe I'd prefer the Wolves. Either way, this game becomes much better if the Pelicans can lose theirs.

**Both teams benefit the Bulls, take your pick**

&nbsp;

Bucks (41-35) vs Nuggets (41-35)

Spread: Nuggets -4.0

Both teams are even but the Nuggets can knock the Pelicans out of the playoffs. Nuggets have the tiebreaker over the Pelicans, so all they need to do is end the season tied for the 8th seed with the Pels to get us a top 14 pick.

**Go Nuggets!**

&nbsp;

Suns (19-58) vs Warriors (55-21) 

Spread: not listed yet

Neither team affects us so just hope the Warriors can make it through a single game without someone getting hurt.

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (21-55) vs Trail Blazers (47-29)

Spread: Trail Blazers -1.0

Trail Blazers have a 4 game lead lead on the Pelicans and the Grizzlies have a 4 game lead on us. Both will very likely stay there, but the Blazers losing 4 games seems a lot more possible than the Grizzlies winning 4 games so might as well root for the Blazers here.

**Go Trail Blazers!** 

&nbsp;

Kings (24-53) vs Lakers (33-42)

Spread: not listed yet

Kings play away after a game last night. Lakers are tough but also beatable, and and upset for the Kings would tie their win total with ours again. 

**Go Kings!**

Knicks played them pretty close but couldn't pull out a win. With their schedule the rest of the year, the Knicks might get 1 more win but could also easily go winless. This means the Bulls can only really afford 1 more win to stay ahead of the Knicks. 

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Raptors(55-20) 99

Celtics (52-23) 110

Celtics have a really nice win to keep their 1 seed hopes alive. Neither team will be affecting the Bulls though.

**Neither team affects pick**

&nbsp;

Nets (24-51) 110

Heat (41-35) 109

Damn was this a crazy game. Nets had their usual 4th quarter lead and then almost gave it away again, ended up holding on to force OT. Nets hit a few nice shots to take the lead in overtime and then gave the Heat like 4 chances to take the lead back in the last minute with turnovers and allowing offensive rebounds. Heat missed all their shots though and the Nets were able to pull a really key upset for us. They are once again tied with the Bulls for 7th. This is really really huge for us because now we can split our games with the Nets (not preferable but very possible) and still stay in the 7th lottery spot. Granted it might mean we're tied for 7th, but every little bit helps in the lottery, and we could also win the coin flip for the 7th pick if the lottery fails us. 

Heat probably don't catch the Pelicans anymore (now 2.5 games back) but that's not nearly as important as the Nets winning.

**Good for tank, Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Warriors(54-21) 112

Kings (24-52) 96

Warriors win it pretty easily, keeping the Kings 1.5 games ahead of the Bulls. The next 3 games for the Kings, however, are all against non-playoff teams, including the top 2 tanks. They are still a very prime candidate to tie or pass, lets hope for some good games from them this week.

**Bad for tank**

(these spreads are what's listed as of 1am, I'll be only on mobile today and edits from there always screw up my format. For updated spreads check: http://www.espn.com/nba/scoreboard/_/date/20180401)

&nbsp;

76ers (45-30) vs Hornets (34-43)

Spread: not listed yet

76ers will have a harder time winning without Embiid, but they are still playing some really good basketball right now, closing in on the 3 seed in the East. They are 2.5 games ahead of the Pelicans, solid but could be better. The rest of the season they only play 2 playoff teams though so they shouldn't have too hard a time staying ahead of the Pels. 

**Go 76ers!**

&nbsp;

Wizards (42-34) vs Bulls (25-51)

Spread: not listed yet

Wizards are just 4-6 in their last 10, but they looked really good last night. The Bulls cannot afford any more wins the rest of the year if we are going to make any more forward progress. The teams ahead of us have winnable games left, but even a single loss before the Nets games really puts anything better than 7th off the table. 

**Go Wizards!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

Rockets (62-14) vs Spurs (44-32) 

Spread: not listed yet

Spurs are now a full 2 games ahead of the Pelicans but I'd prefer them to stay at that length because they end the season with a game against the Pelicans. Playing the Rockets is always tough, but they clinched home court through the playoffs yesterday so they aren't actually playing for anything anymore. Let's hope the Rockets take it easy and the Spurs get a win.

**Go Spurs!**

&nbsp;

Pacers (45-31) vs Clippers (41-35)

Spread: Clippers -3.0

Pacers are 2 games ahead of the Pelicans and the Clippers are 2 games behind. Clippers have the advantage of being able to knock the Pelicans out of the playoffs though, so they get the advantage here. Pacers win would be good to stay well ahead of the Pelicans, but the Clippers catching the Pelicans would be a much more significant improvement.  

**Go Clippers!**

&nbsp;

Magic (22-53) vs Hawks (21-55)

Spread: Hawks -2.0

As hard as it is to see us catching the Magic after that terrible game on Friday, they still have an easy enough schedule that tying them is possible. If the Magic win this game, then we just have to hope that the winner of Mavs vs Magic gets at least 1 more win. That would tie the Bulls win total and we could match them by losing out.

**Go Magic!**

&nbsp;

Pistons (36-40) vs Nets (25-51)

Spread: not listed yet

Nets pulled a great upset yesterday and now they play a worse team tonight. Pistons are decent, but can definitely be beaten if they Nets play a good game. Over the next 3 games the Nets play the Pistons, Bucks, and Embiid-less 76ers. Those are all fairly tough opponents, but the Nets definitely have a chance to win in all of them. If they could manage just 1 win in those 3 games, the Bulls could split our 2 games with the Nets and still stay a game ahead of them. This will probably be the best chance here so let's hope for the win. 

**Go Nets!**

&nbsp;

Mavericks (23-53) vs Cavaliers (46-30)

Spread: not listed yet

If the Mavericks were able to win this one and we lose to the Wizards, we would be just 1 game behind them and looking very good to pass them. More likely the Cavaliers win this, but that's not too bad either with the Cavs 3 games ahead of the Pelicans. They shouldn't have any trouble keeping that lead though.

**Go Mavericks!**

&nbsp;

Thunder (44-33) vs Pelicans (43-33) 

Spread: Thunder -1.0

Big game here with the Thunder only 0.5 games ahead. Both teams are on 3 game losing streaks and are fighting for positioning in the West. A win for Thunder would be huge to take a bigger lead on the Pelicans and give the other teams around the Pelicans a chance to move farther ahead.

**Go Thunder!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

Jazz (43-33) vs Timberwolves (44-33)

Spread: not listed yet

Jazz are tied with the Pelicans and Wolves are 0.5 games ahead so not too much variance here. Whatever happens in this game we just need both teams to finish ahead of the Pelicans. I have more faith in the Jazz to finish strong, so I think I'll root for them, but then again if the Pelicans lose more than maybe I'd prefer the Wolves. Either way, this game becomes much better if the Pelicans can lose theirs.

**Both teams benefit the Bulls, take your pick**

&nbsp;

Bucks (41-35) vs Nuggets (41-35)

Spread: Nuggets -4.0

Both teams are even but the Nuggets can knock the Pelicans out of the playoffs. Nuggets have the tiebreaker over the Pelicans, so all they need to do is end the season tied for the 8th seed with the Pels to get us a top 14 pick.

**Go Nuggets!**

&nbsp;

Suns (19-58) vs Warriors (55-21) 

Spread: not listed yet

Neither team affects us so just hope the Warriors can make it through a single game without someone getting hurt.

**Neither team affects our picks**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (21-55) vs Trail Blazers (47-29)

Spread: Trail Blazers -1.0

Trail Blazers have a 4 game lead lead on the Pelicans and the Grizzlies have a 4 game lead on us. Both will very likely stay there, but the Blazers losing 4 games seems a lot more possible than the Grizzlies winning 4 games so might as well root for the Blazers here.

**Go Trail Blazers!** 

&nbsp;

Kings (24-53) vs Lakers (33-42)

Spread: not listed yet

Kings play away after a game last night. Lakers are tough but also beatable, and and upset for the Kings would tie their win total with ours again. 

**Go Kings!**

"*I should be able to update these with more summaries later in the afternoon

Well it was a nice 24 hours out of 8th. As usual we get a win right when we're about to make some major progress up the standings. However, it was already unlikely that we would actually lose out, and we still have a very good opportunity to do move up from 8th. Other games today mostly went our way. The Pelicans lost and a lot of the teams around them won.

Today there are only 5 games, but the 3 teams that matter most to the tank (Nets, Kings, Knicks) are all playing. They will all be underdogs, but they also all have a reasonable chance to win. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Bulls (25-51) 90

Magic(22-53) 82

We were playing an away game on the second of back to back nights with one of the worst lineups I've seen, and we still beat the Magic easily. Not much more we could have done to tank that one, just ran into a Magic team that played even worse than we possibly could. A win could have put us 0.5 games out of 4th, but after winning the best we can realistically root for is probably 6th. 

**Bad for tank x2**

&nbsp;

76ers (44-30) 101

Hawks(21-54) 91

76ers play well even without Embiid, gain a crucial game on the Pelicans here. They are now 2.5 games ahead and will likely stay ahead of them for the end of the season.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Pelicans (43-32) 102

Cavaliers(45-30) 107

Pelicans controlled the game for a while, but Cavs have a really nice second half to win a huge game for us. Pelicans are now back to the 18th pick and still have tough games remaining. Cavaliers also gain another game to their lead over the Pelicans, now at 3 games ahead.

**Good for Pelicans pick x2**

&nbsp;

Suns (19-57) 103

Rockets(61-14) 104

Somehow this game took a last second 3 from Green for the Rockets to beat the Suns. None of it affected the Bulls so just another weird game.

**Doesn't affect either pick**

&nbsp;

Nuggets (40-35) 126

Thunder (44-32) 125

Nuggets get a win to keep them in the playoff race, only 2 games back of the Pelicans now (not sure about the tiebreaker for them I'll check that soon). Thunder continue to stay close to the Pelicans though, still just 0.5 games ahead of them. Thunder need to pick it up because the Pelicans won't keep losing for much longer.

**(mostly) Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Wolves(43-33) 93

Mavs (23-52) 92

Mavericks almost pull a really nice upset that would have kept them close to us. They are still just 2 games ahead, but with so few games left that will still be a tough gap to close. Not all bad in this game as the Timberwolves leap frog the Pelicans in the West. Not sure of the Wolves ability to stay ahead of them though.

**Bad for tank, Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies(21-54) 97

Jazz (42-33) 107

Jazz win to tie up the Pelicans in the West. I'm more confident in their ability to get ahead of the Pelicans than the Timberwolves, but they have lost a few crucial games lately too.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Bucks (40-35) 124

Lakers (33-41) 122

Bucks are two games back of the Pelicans now. If they could tie them up, there would be a coin flip chance for that pick to get even higher which would be a nice bonus.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Clippers(41-34) 96

Blazers (46-29) 105

Clippers stay 2 games back, could have gained a crucial game here. Still only need to gain one game and then beat the Pelicans for the Clips to pass them tough. Blazers put themselves pretty much out of reach for the Pelicans though so that's nice.

**(mostly) Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Hornets (34-42) vs Wizards (41-34)

Spread: Wizards -5.5

This one just ended as I'm typing, Wizards win to gain a half game on the Pelicans, could tie or pass them before the end of the year.

**Go Wizards!**

&nbsp;

Pistons (35-40) vs Knicks (27-49)

Spread: Pistons -4.0

This one just started, Knicks are only 2 games back of the Bulls now, which could be dangerous with our two games against the Nets. A win for them would be a nice cushion so we can keep the 8th spot at the very least. Pistons are inconsistent as always so this game could go either way.

**Go Knicks!**

&nbsp;

Raptors (55-20) vs Celtics (52-23) 

Spread: Raptors -4.5

No effect on the Bulls, Celtics probably won't be able to catch the Raptors for the 1 seed anyways, even with a win.

**Neither team affects pick**

&nbsp;

Nets (24-51) vs Heat (41-35)

Spread: Heat -8.0

Nets could help us out a lot with a win here. We will always be able to pass them if we lose to them twice at the end of the year, but that's not a given. I'd much rather be even or ahead of them when those games happen, and a win here would be huge. Heat are playing pretty well but Nets have been beating a lot of teams through 3 quarters. Maybe Nets will figure out how to play that last quarter for this one.

**Go Nets!**

&nbsp;

Warriors (54-21) vs Kings (24-52)

Spread: Warriors -8.5

Warriors have Durant back but didn't play too well even in the half he wasn't ejected. I doubt the Kings win here, but with the Warriors short handed it's significantly more possible.

**Go Kings!**

"I know the Bulls might probably not take him at 8th but here's the argument for it.

The point of the draft for the Bulls is to take a player with franchise cornerstone type of upside. Yes, there are safer picks at 8th like Wendell Carter and Mikal Bridges, but you can always get role players of that type through free agency. I don't see Wendell, for example, being that much better from Bobby and even Noah in terms of value as a future prospect. 

So given that, if the Bulls fall to 8th, they need to up their risk appetite. Try to get a guy with high risk high reward type of profile. A high ceiling and low floor type prospect. 

That's where Mitchell falls into place. He is a quick twitch athlete with 7'1"" height and 7'3"" wingspan. He can dribble a bit, roll to the rim and shoot from the outside. He looks like the type who can also put on a lot of muscle in the future. Also, and I think this is the most important, Mitchell looks like the type of guy who can hang with NBA guards when switched. Bigs who cannot do this at a respectable rate will not be able to play big minutes in the playoffs.

"We're finally out of 8th!!! We haven't been able to move past 8th place in what seems like forever, but our tank is finally moving up. We were tied for 6th for a brief time until the Pacers closed out against the Kings, but we are still tied for 7th with the Nets and the only reason the Kings are ahead is because they have an extra game. All we have to do now is get less wins than the Kings and Nets the rest of the year, and we vastly improve our lottery chances. And that's not even mentioning the Mavs and Magic who we could also pass if everything goes well. 

Today is a huge day, with 7 out of the 9 games having major impact on our draft picks. Most important is our game against the Magic. Losing today would tie us for the 6th pick, and move the Magic to just 0.5 games ahead of us. This will be our toughest opponent the rest of the season, and it is an absolute must-lose game. Other biggest games include Pelicans playing the Cavs which is big for that pick, and the Mavericks playing some team that just lost to the Grizzlies. No matter how the other games go, tomorrow will be made good or bad entirely based on Bulls vs Magic.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Wizards(41-33) 92

Pistons (34-40) 103

Drummond had a nice double double (24-23) to take down the Wizards. This puts the Wizards 2 games behind the Pelicans now, meaning even if the Pelicans are forced into the 8th seed in the West they will still likely pick behind 3 playoff teams in the East. 

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Bulls (24-50) 92

Heat (40-35) 103

Heat lead for pretty much the whole game, and we never threatened that too much and coasted to a loss. Extending our losing streak to 7, Bulls keep on rolling in the lottery race. We're up to 7th in the standings now, and have huge opportunity for much more.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Thunder(44-31) 99

Spurs (43-32) 103

This temporarily moves the Spurs ahead of the Pelicans by 0.5 games, but it also moves the Thunder back to just 0.5 games ahead of the Pels. I preferred the Spurs in this one, but only with the hope that they both move ahead of the Pelicans by the end of the season. 

**(mostly) Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Pacers(44-31) 106

Kings (24-51) 103

As usual, the tank team plays well and makes it a very close game before eventually failing to close it out with a win. I'm glad to see the Kings playing well though, they play that way against the rest of their schedule and they will get the wins that we need them to get. Pacers winning isn't all bad either, it moves them up to 1.5 games ahead of the Pelicans.

**Bad for tank, Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Bucks (39-35) 116

Warriors(54-20) 107

KD was back for a half before he got ejected, giving the Bucks an easier time winning it. Bucks are still 3 games behind the Pelicans and probably won't catch them though.

**Neither team affects us**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Bulls (24-51) vs Magic (22-52)

Spread: Magic -6.5 (love this big spread)

Away game for the Bulls on back to back nights with several big players out for the Bulls. This is as good of a chance as we will get to lose to the only remaining tank on the schedule. Implications of this game are huge: a loss puts us 0.5 games out of 4th, and a win would put us back to 8th. If there was ever a time for our clutch tank commanders to show up, its tonight.

Dunn and Lavine are out for this one, I haven't heard anything about Lauri or Felicio yet. Magic have some injuries of their own with Fournier and Simmons out too. Everyone focus all your energy into this one, we need a loss bad.

**GO MAGIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

76ers (44-30) vs Hawks (21-54)

Spread: 76ers -not listed yet

76ers are 1.5 games ahead of the Pelicans and look good lately, but they also just lost Embiid for the rest of the regular season. They shouldn't have a problem in this one, but they will be a key team to stay ahead of the Pelicans the rest of the way. Hawks are out of reach unless they pull 3-4 major upsets in their last 7 games, best thing they can do for our draft picks is to lose out.

**Go 76ers!**

&nbsp;

Pelicans (43-32) vs Cavaliers (45-30) 

Spread: not listed yet

This is a big game for the Pelicans pick. A Pelicans loss would give the Timberwolves a chance to move ahead of them, give the Jazz a chance to tie them, and give the Clippers a chance to move within a game of them. It also would move the Cavs up to 3 games ahead of them. It won't be easy for the Cavs with Love and probably Korver out for them.

**Go Cavaliers!!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

Suns (19-57) vs Rockets (61-14)

Spread: Rockets -∞

Best team vs worst team, neither team close enough to affect the Bulls.

**Doesn't affect either pick**

&nbsp;

Nuggets (40-35) vs Thunder (44-32)

Spread: Thunder -3.5

Nuggets are 3 games back of the Pelicans, Thunder are much more important at just 0.5 games ahead of the Pelicans. Both teams have been inconsistent lately and lost their last two games.

**Go Thunder!**

&nbsp;

Timberwolves (43-33) vs Mavericks (23-52)

Spread: Timberwolves -5.5

This game is coming at the perfect time, with the Mavericks playing well of late and the Timberwolves losing to the Grizzlies and then needed 56 points from Towns to avoid losing to the Hawks. Very possible that the Mavericks can win this, which (combined with a Bulls loss) would tie the Bulls for 5th at the end of the night. Timberwolves win is not all though, they are just 0.5 games behind the Pelicans and we need them to get wins too (just preferably not tonight).

**Go Mavericks!**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (21-54) vs Jazz (42-33)

Spread: Jazz -not listed yet

They aren't close enough yet, but if the Grizzlies continue their weird winning streak we might be rooting for them again. Jazz's chances to catch the Pelicans are much more likely at this point, at only 1 game back. A win here could possibly tie them. 

**Go Jazz!**

&nbsp;

Bucks (40-35) vs Lakers (33-41)

Spread: not listed yet

Bucks probably won't catch the Pelicans, but it's possible so might as well root for them here against a Lakers team that won't affect anything.

**Go Bucks!**

&nbsp;

Clippers (41-34) vs Trail Blazers (46-29)

Spread: Trail Blazers -6.0

Clippers play the Pelicans in their second to last game of the year, so they just need to stay within 1 game of them to have a chance to knock them out (winning that game would give them the tiebreaker). They can get to that 1 game back tonight, but they will have to beat a tough Trail Blazers team to do it. Trail Blazers win would be pretty good too, they are 3 games ahead of the Pelicans but insurance is always nice.

**Go Clippers!**

"Another day, another step toward moving up in the lottery standings. The Nets beat the Magic, tying our win total so that they are just a Bulls loss away from being even with us. Magic stay 2 games ahead of us but they are not out of the woods yet. We also had some pretty good luck with the games affecting our other pick, with most teams gaining on the Pelicans (except the Jazz) or extending their lead (except the Trail Blazers).

Today there are just 5 games, but there are some important ones. Bulls need this loss to the Heat to keep our progress steadily forward. Kings also play, giving us a chance to pass them if they can upset the Pacers. We've got less than two weeks left in the season, time to tank when it really matters!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Cavaliers(44-30) 118

Hornets (34-41) 105

Lebron scored 41 to lead the Cavs to a needed win. They are now a full 2 games ahead of the Pelicans and look pretty good to stay ahead of them.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Nets (23-51) 111

Magic(22-51) 104

Nets held the lead for the whole game, amazingly didn't collapse in the 4th quarter. That win puts them at 24 wins with the Bulls and Kings. All we have to do is outlose those two teams and we can double our current odds for getting a top 3 pick. Magic stay 2 games ahead of the Bulls, but they still have 4 more games in a row against other tanks, including their game tomorrow against us. If the Bulls can just lose their games to these two teams, we have a very real chance at lottery spot 4 or 5.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Knicks(27-48) 101

76ers (43-30) 118

76ers continue their dominance and win their 8th straight game. That moves them 1.5 games ahead of the Pelicans and looking like they will stay that way. Knicks loss keeps them dangerous at just 2 games back. As good of a chance we have of moving up in the lottery, the Bulls getting a few wins is always possible so we can't be comfortable yet. 

**Bad for tank, Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Blazers (46-28) 103

Grizzlies(20-54) 108

Coming out of the all-star break we needed the Grizzlies to win, and they went on a losing streak for a month and a half. Now that they are out of reach we need them to lose, and they are upsetting multiple playoff teams. Blazers missed Lillard bad in the 4th quarter, never able to go on that run to win the game. This doesn't hurt the Blazers too much thanks to their win over the Pelicans Tuesday, but it makes them a little more vulnerable if the Pels were to win out. 

If the Grizzlies manage to upset another team or two they might be possible to pass again. I'm not ready to start rooting for them yet, but 3 games back isn't impossible if the Grizzlies are able to keep this up.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Hawks (21-53) 114

Wolves (42-33) 126

KAT went on a rampage and carried his team to a needed victory. He scored 56 points to set a franchise record. This puts the Timberwolves just 0.5 games behind the Pelicans now.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Celtics(51-23) 97

Jazz (42-32) 94

Back and worth game, Celtics were finally able to eek one out. Unfortunately it came against the Jazz, who could have tied the Pelicans in the West with a win. 

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Clippers(41-34) 111

Suns (19-57) 99

Suns kept it worryingly close for a while but the Clippers took the game with a 18-0 run to start the 4th. Clippers are now just 2 games behind the Pelicans, could still catch them if they win some tough games.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Mavs (23-51) 93

Lakers(32-41) 103

Mavericks looked great in the first half and then took a 13 point lead in the 3rd when the Lakers couldn't hit a shot. I was really starting to think they were going to win, but then the Lakers ended the 3rd on a scoring run and the Mavericks couldn't hit a shot to save their lives in the 4th quarter. Missed opportunity for the Bulls to improve, if the Mavericks can sustain what they had in the first half for a whole game they'll get the wins we need them to.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Wizards (41-33) vs Pistons (34-40)

Spread: Wizards -1.5

Wizards are only 1.5 games behind the Pelicans right now, could pass them if the Wiz play well. This game should be a win for them and they don't have the hardest schedule after this either. 

**Go Wizards!**

&nbsp;

Bulls (24-50) vs Heat (40-35)

Spread: Heat -12.5

Bulls have done well lately and should be able to continue tonight. Heat aren't exactly an auto-loss, but they have played some good games lately and will be playing hard every game to improve their seed.

I haven't heard for sure yet as of when I'm writing this (last night) but I believe the Bulls will be putting forward the same roster we have lately with Lavine and Dunn still out. The game that matters even more than this though, is tomorrow. On a back to back we play the Magic and we desperately need that loss.

**Go Heat!**

&nbsp;

Thunder (44-31) vs Spurs (43-32) 

Spread: Thunder -4.0

Spurs are tied with the Pelicans and Thunder are 1 game ahead of them both. Spurs get the small edge being closer, but we need both teams to finish above the Pelicans if we are going to stay in the teens.

**Go Spurs!**

&nbsp;

Pacers (44-31) vs Kings (24-51)

Spread: Pacers -8.0

Should be a win for the Pacers, but they have lost to a few tanks this year and the Kings look pretty decent lately. An upset in this game would be amazing, and allow the Bulls to move ahead of the Kings. Pacers win is good in a way too, they are only 1 game ahead of the Pelicans right now.

**Go Kings!**

&nbsp;

Bucks (39-35) vs Warriors (54-20)

Spread: Warriors -5.5

Bucks aren't catching the Pelicans so nothing affects the Bulls in this one.

**Neither team affects us**

"It's always a good day when the Bulls and Pelicans both get a loss. Our 6 game losing streak has got us just 1 game out of the top 5 in the lottery standings. The Pelicans are still at the same pick (tied for 20) but they gave the teams around them opportunity to take a bigger lead or catch up. 

Today we are blessed with another tank vs tank game where either the Magic move to just 1 game ahead of us or the Nets go to just 0.5 games ahead of us. There is also a chance for the Mavericks to get another win and a few easy wins for teams competing the Pelicans.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Spurs (43-31) 106

Wizards(40-33) 116

Spurs miss out on a good opportunity to get ahead of the Pelicans, are now still tied with them at the 22 pick. Wizards win puts them just 1.5 games behind the Pelicans though, which is more and more important as it looks like the Pelicans will make the playoffs.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Nuggets(40-34) 110

Raptors (54-20) 114

Nuggets miss out on a chance to get back to 2 games behind the Pelicans, can't keep their 4th quarter lead. They are still 3 games back, and now also behind the Clippers, doesn't look too good for their playoff chances.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Cavs (44-29) 79

Heat (39-35) 98

Cavaliers stay at 1.5 games ahead of the Pelicans after tonight, could have taken a nice commanding lead if they were able to score. We'll need them to go back to winning to stay ahead of the Pels.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Bulls (24-49) 86

Rockets(60-14) 118

Nice easy loss here, never in any danger even with two key starters out for the Rockets. We are in a very nice position now where we can realistically get all the way to the 4th lottery spot. It is dependent, however, on us losing out. Any wins over our last 8 games (especially to the Magic or Nets) could ruin all of this nice progress we made. This is the time when our tank really needs to shine.

We didn't have too many players play well on offense, but Lauri shot well finishing with 22. He also had 5 turnovers though to lead the team.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Blazers (45-28) 107

Pelicans(43-31) 103

This game was scary to watch. Trail Blazers played well, but screwed up several chances to put away the Pelicans in the last few minutes. Luckily, the Pelicans missed their opportunities to take the lead and the Blazers were able to squeak out the win. 

Trail Blazers now have a very comfortable 3.5 game lead over the Pelicans and will likely finish with their 3 seed. Pelicans are still at the 22 spot, but they stay within striking distance of the Jazz and Timberwolves, and didn't gain anything on teams above them.

**Good for Pelicans pick x2**

&nbsp;

Mavs (22-51) 103

Kings (24-50) 97

No matter which tank you wanted to win, the end result was the Bulls gaining a crucial game on a vulnerable tank. Kings win would have given us control of the 7th spot, but the Mavericks win puts both of these teams within a game of passing. It is even more important that we lose out now so that we can take advantage of every tank that wins. The game was very back and forth, with the Mavericks dominating for a while before the Kings would pull it together and mount a comeback. We need both teams at the top of their game the rest of the season.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Pacers (43-31) 92

Warriors(54-19) 81

Pacers take a 1 game lead on the Pelicans, the are one of the most important teams regarding the Pelicans pick right now. Warriors went from a matchup that was pretty much an auto-loss for the other team, to quite a favorable target for playoff teams. They'll get Durant back soon though so that could change. 

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Bucks (39-34) 98

Clippers(39-34) 105

Clippers stay alive in the Pelicans pick race, getting up to 2.5 games behind. They are pretty inconsistent lately, but if they can turn it on and win out they have a shot at passing the Pelicans and forcing them (or more likely the Timberwolves) out of the playoffs.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Cavaliers (44-30) vs Hornets (34-41)

Spread: Hornets -1.5

Cavaliers don't look too good but they are still ahead of the Pelicans. They need to win all of these games against non-playoff teams to ensure they stay ahead.

**Go Cavaliers!**

&nbsp;

Nets (23-51) vs Magic (22-51)

Spread: Nets -3.0

It's tough to pick which team to root for, but no matter what the result of this game benefits the Bulls. On one hand the Nets are slightly closer to the Bulls and it would be very nice to be just 0.5 games behind them. But we also have 2 games against them to end the season, so it might be better to take the Magic win tonight and then take the lead from the Nets when we play them. Considering all factors, I slightly prefer the Nets to win this. They have a harder schedule than the Magic after this game and I don't trust that they can 100% beat us in both of our games against them. Magic could definitely pick up 2-3 more wins the rest of the year even if they lose this one. It's just a matter of perspective though so root for who you want in this one.

**Go Nets! (or Magic)**

&nbsp;

Knicks (27-48) vs 76ers (43-30) 

Spread: 76ers -12.5

76ers are red hot and they will almost definitely take this game over the Knicks. I almost prefer the 76ers here because they are a narrow 1 game ahead of the Pelicans whereas the Knicks are 2.5 games behind the Bulls now. Bulls pick has priority though, I would rather the Knicks win here and guarantee that they won't pass us in the lottery. The much more likely 76ers win is a very good result as well though.

**Go Knicks!**

&nbsp;

Trail Blazers (46-28) vs Grizzlies (20-54)

Spread: Trail Blazers -6.5

The Grizzlies recent winning ""surge"" has this spread a lot closer than I would have thought. Trail Blazers are back to back as well though and will probably be sitting or limiting some guys tonight. Trail Blazers already have a nice lead over the Pelicans but adding here would be nice.

Side note: if we lost our two games to the Grizzlies earlier this month, we would be tied with them for 3rd lottery spot and just a game out of 2nd. Just shows how much every game matters.

**Go Trail Blazers!**

&nbsp;

Hawks (21-53) vs Timberwolves (42-33)

Spread: Pelicans -12.0

Losing to the Grizzlies is pretty terrible, so there's no way they can lose to the Hawks right? Let's hope not because as bad as they have been since the break, they are still only a game behind the Pelicans. They need to find their form and rack up the wins the rest of the year (before they fizzle out in the first round)

**Go Timberwolves!**

&nbsp;

Celtics (51-23) vs Jazz (42-32)

Spread: Jazz -8.5

Jazz are 1 game back of the Pelicans and have the best chance to pass them out of all the teams behind the Pels. They play a still short handed Celtics team tonight and we need the Celtics to continue their losing ways to help our pick.

**Go Jazz!**

&nbsp;

Clippers (40-34) vs Suns (19-56)

Spread: Clippers -10.0

Clippers can take the Pelicans lead over them down to 2 with a win here. Suns are back in their unwinnable mode and have lost 12 straight. Best thing the Suns can do for us now is to lose out (expect beating the Pelicans) and help all the tanks/playoff teams they play.

**Go Clippers!**

&nbsp;

Mavericks (23-51) vs Lakers (32-41)

Spread: Lakers -8.5

Mavericks had a nice win last night and play a beatable and inconstant Lakers teams here. They are on the second of back to backs though so it'll be tough for this tank to pull the upset. They have had flashes of decent lately though, and a win here would be really really amazing for the Bulls. Mavericks are 1 game ahead of us but only play 2 more tanks the rest of the year. Even if they win both of those (not a guarantee) we would still have to lose out to beat them outright. That means we need to hope for one of these non tanks to have an off night and lose to the Mavs, and the Lakers are prime candidates for that.

**Go Mavericks!**

Lottery Standings: http://www.tankathon.com

Odds for each lottery spot: http://www.tankathon.com/pick_odds

* Bulls pick is currently at 8 and we are 5.5 games back of the top spot

* Bulls are 2.5 games ahead of the Knicks for the 9th spot, 0.5 games behind the Kings for the 7th spot, and 1 games back of the Mavericks and Nets for the 5th spot

* Pelicans are tied for the 20th spot in the draft, 2.5 games from slipping out of the playoffs and 3.5 games back of the Trail Blazers for the 26th spot.","Tank Watch: March 28th, 2018 It's always a good day when the Bulls and Pelicans both get a loss. Our 6 game losing streak has got us just 1 game out of the top 5 in the lottery standings. The Pelicans are still at the same pick (tied for 20) but they gave the teams around them opportunity to take a bigger lead or catch up. 

Today we are blessed with another tank vs tank game where either the Magic move to just 1 game ahead of us or the Nets go to just 0.5 games ahead of us. There is also a chance for the Mavericks to get another win and a few easy wins for teams competing the Pelicans.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Spurs (43-31) 106

Wizards(40-33) 116

Spurs miss out on a good opportunity to get ahead of the Pelicans, are now still tied with them at the 22 pick. Wizards win puts them just 1.5 games behind the Pelicans though, which is more and more important as it looks like the Pelicans will make the playoffs.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Nuggets(40-34) 110

Raptors (54-20) 114

Nuggets miss out on a chance to get back to 2 games behind the Pelicans, can't keep their 4th quarter lead. They are still 3 games back, and now also behind the Clippers, doesn't look too good for their playoff chances.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Cavs (44-29) 79

Heat (39-35) 98

Cavaliers stay at 1.5 games ahead of the Pelicans after tonight, could have taken a nice commanding lead if they were able to score. We'll need them to go back to winning to stay ahead of the Pels.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Bulls (24-49) 86

Rockets(60-14) 118

Nice easy loss here, never in any danger even with two key starters out for the Rockets. We are in a very nice position now where we can realistically get all the way to the 4th lottery spot. It is dependent, however, on us losing out. Any wins over our last 8 games (especially to the Magic or Nets) could ruin all of this nice progress we made. This is the time when our tank really needs to shine.

We didn't have too many players play well on offense, but Lauri shot well finishing with 22. He also had 5 turnovers though to lead the team.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Blazers (45-28) 107

Pelicans(43-31) 103

This game was scary to watch. Trail Blazers played well, but screwed up several chances to put away the Pelicans in the last few minutes. Luckily, the Pelicans missed their opportunities to take the lead and the Blazers were able to squeak out the win. 

Trail Blazers now have a very comfortable 3.5 game lead over the Pelicans and will likely finish with their 3 seed. Pelicans are still at the 22 spot, but they stay within striking distance of the Jazz and Timberwolves, and didn't gain anything on teams above them.

**Good for Pelicans pick x2**

&nbsp;

Mavs (22-51) 103

Kings (24-50) 97

No matter which tank you wanted to win, the end result was the Bulls gaining a crucial game on a vulnerable tank. Kings win would have given us control of the 7th spot, but the Mavericks win puts both of these teams within a game of passing. It is even more important that we lose out now so that we can take advantage of every tank that wins. The game was very back and forth, with the Mavericks dominating for a while before the Kings would pull it together and mount a comeback. We need both teams at the top of their game the rest of the season.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Pacers (43-31) 92

Warriors(54-19) 81

Pacers take a 1 game lead on the Pelicans, the are one of the most important teams regarding the Pelicans pick right now. Warriors went from a matchup that was pretty much an auto-loss for the other team, to quite a favorable target for playoff teams. They'll get Durant back soon though so that could change. 

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Bucks (39-34) 98

Clippers(39-34) 105

Clippers stay alive in the Pelicans pick race, getting up to 2.5 games behind. They are pretty inconsistent lately, but if they can turn it on and win out they have a shot at passing the Pelicans and forcing them (or more likely the Timberwolves) out of the playoffs.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Cavaliers (44-30) vs Hornets (34-41)

Spread: Hornets -1.5

Cavaliers don't look too good but they are still ahead of the Pelicans. They need to win all of these games against non-playoff teams to ensure they stay ahead.

**Go Cavaliers!**

&nbsp;

Nets (23-51) vs Magic (22-51)

Spread: Nets -3.0

It's tough to pick which team to root for, but no matter what the result of this game benefits the Bulls. On one hand the Nets are slightly closer to the Bulls and it would be very nice to be just 0.5 games behind them. But we also have 2 games against them to end the season, so it might be better to take the Magic win tonight and then take the lead from the Nets when we play them. Considering all factors, I slightly prefer the Nets to win this. They have a harder schedule than the Magic after this game and I don't trust that they can 100% beat us in both of our games against them. Magic could definitely pick up 2-3 more wins the rest of the year even if they lose this one. It's just a matter of perspective though so root for who you want in this one.

**Go Nets! (or Magic)**

&nbsp;

Knicks (27-48) vs 76ers (43-30) 

Spread: 76ers -12.5

76ers are red hot and they will almost definitely take this game over the Knicks. I almost prefer the 76ers here because they are a narrow 1 game ahead of the Pelicans whereas the Knicks are 2.5 games behind the Bulls now. Bulls pick has priority though, I would rather the Knicks win here and guarantee that they won't pass us in the lottery. The much more likely 76ers win is a very good result as well though.

**Go Knicks!**

&nbsp;

Trail Blazers (46-28) vs Grizzlies (20-54)

Spread: Trail Blazers -6.5

The Grizzlies recent winning ""surge"" has this spread a lot closer than I would have thought. Trail Blazers are back to back as well though and will probably be sitting or limiting some guys tonight. Trail Blazers already have a nice lead over the Pelicans but adding here would be nice.

Side note: if we lost our two games to the Grizzlies earlier this month, we would be tied with them for 3rd lottery spot and just a game out of 2nd. Just shows how much every game matters.

**Go Trail Blazers!**

&nbsp;

Hawks (21-53) vs Timberwolves (42-33)

Spread: Pelicans -12.0

Losing to the Grizzlies is pretty terrible, so there's no way they can lose to the Hawks right? Let's hope not because as bad as they have been since the break, they are still only a game behind the Pelicans. They need to find their form and rack up the wins the rest of the year (before they fizzle out in the first round)

**Go Timberwolves!**

&nbsp;

Celtics (51-23) vs Jazz (42-32)

Spread: Jazz -8.5

Jazz are 1 game back of the Pelicans and have the best chance to pass them out of all the teams behind the Pels. They play a still short handed Celtics team tonight and we need the Celtics to continue their losing ways to help our pick.

**Go Jazz!**

&nbsp;

Clippers (40-34) vs Suns (19-56)

Spread: Clippers -10.0

Clippers can take the Pelicans lead over them down to 2 with a win here. Suns are back in their unwinnable mode and have lost 12 straight. Best thing the Suns can do for us now is to lose out (expect beating the Pelicans) and help all the tanks/playoff teams they play.

**Go Clippers!**

&nbsp;

Mavericks (23-51) vs Lakers (32-41)

Spread: Lakers -8.5

"Yesterday wasn't too big a deal but several things went against us. Knicks lost to the Hornets, not the end of the wold, but sucks they lost after taking it to OT. Timberwolves lost a crucial game to the fucking Grizzlies, hard to see them catching the Pelicans if they lose games like this. Lastly, the Nuggets lost to put them a full 3 games back of the Pelicans with just 8 games left in the season. So unless they get back to within 1-2 games, I'm going to stop rooting for the Nuggets to catch the Pels and just plan for the Pelicans to make the playoffs. This makes the East playoff teams even more important.

Today is a huge day for the Bulls, and losing to the top team in the league we'll be gaining at least something. Kings and Mavs play so that's where we can gain, Pelicans have a tough game today, several playoff teams close to the Pelicans have chances to gain or pass them today as well. As long as we lose, today will a good day.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Knicks (27-47) 128

Hornets(33-41) 137

Knicks actually have a really nice comeback to force OT but can't come away with the win.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Lakers (32-40) 106

Pistons (33-40) 112



**Doesn't affect either pick**

&nbsp;

Nuggets(40-33) 104

76ers (42-30) 123

76ers stay ahead of the Pelicans for now, which we definitely need them to do now that the Pelicans are almost definitely making the playoffs. Nuggets aren't likely to catch the Pelicans now though, so we can pretty much stop rooting for them the rest of the way.

**Good for Pelicans pick, also bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies(19-54) 101

Wolves (42-32) 93

C'mon Wolves... They lose to the worst team in the league when they need wins to stay in the playoffs. Thibs is getting a lot of (deserved) heat for how much he played his starters in this one. But this game was also the Wolves starters getting outplayed by Grizzlies bench players, which is just terrible no matter how many minutes they are playing. Hard to see them passing the Pelicans now but they are still just 1.5 games back.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Celtics(50-23) 102

Suns (19-55) 94



**Doesn't affect either pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Spurs (43-31) vs Wizards (40-33)

Spread: Spurs -2.0

Spurs are dead even with the Pelicans with just 8 games to go. They do not have the easiest schedule the rest of the way, but the Spurs end the season with a game against the Pelicans. As long as they stay close they can catch the Pels in the last game.

**Go Spurs!**

&nbsp;

Nuggets (40-34) vs Raptors (54-20)

Spread: Raptors -8.5

I know I just said I'm giving up on the Nuggets, but Raptors don't affect anything so we might as well root for the Nuggets for this one.

**Go Nuggets!**

&nbsp;

Cavaliers (44-29) vs Heat (39-35) 

Spread: Cavaliers -2.5

Cavaliers are ahead of the Pelicans and need to stay ahead of them to finish the season. They are hot on a 5 game winning streak so let's hope that can continue tonight.

**Go Cavaliers!**

&nbsp;

Bulls (24-49) vs Rockets (60-14)

Spread: Rockets -13.5 (yesterday it was -17.5)

Rockets are sitting Harden and Capela which isn't good, but they are still a very good team and will still likely take this one. Bulls will still have the same guys out with injury plus Lauri and Valentine as questionable. Losing this game could move us up to the 7th lottery spot.

**Go Rockets!**

&nbsp;

Trail Blazers (45-28) vs Pelicans (43-31)

Spread: Pelicans -1.0

This is important not just to force the Pelicans down, but also to get the Trail Blazers a more commanding lead on the 3rd seed. As well as the Pelicans do, them getting the 3 would be worst case scenario.

**Go Trail Blazers!!!!!!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

Mavericks (22-51) vs Kings (24-50)

Spread: Kings -2.5

Kings win and we lose and we can pass the Kings for the 7th spot. Kings are playing very well of late, so I like their chances here. Mavericks win would be good too because it would put them just 1 game ahead of the Bulls, giving us a better chance to pass both them and the Kings.

**Go Kings! (or Mavericks!)**

&nbsp;

Pacers (43-31) vs Warriors (54-19)

Spread: Pacers -6.5

Pacers are tied with the Pelicans now and could move ahead of them today. They are just as crucial as the West playoff teams now that it is almost assured the Pelicans are in the playoffs.

**Go Pacers!**

&nbsp;

Bucks (39-34) vs Clippers (39-34)

Spread: Clippers -3.0

This game pretty much doesn't matter, but there's a slim slim slim chance that the Clippers catch the Pelicans so might as well root for them here.

**Go Clippers!**

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Spurs (43-31) vs Wizards (40-33)

Spread: Spurs -2.0

Spurs are dead even with the Pelicans with just 8 games to go. They do not have the easiest schedule the rest of the way, but the Spurs end the season with a game against the Pelicans. As long as they stay close they can catch the Pels in the last game.

**Go Spurs!**

&nbsp;

Nuggets (40-34) vs Raptors (54-20)

Spread: Raptors -8.5

I know I just said I'm giving up on the Nuggets, but Raptors don't affect anything so we might as well root for the Nuggets for this one.

**Go Nuggets!**

&nbsp;

Cavaliers (44-29) vs Heat (39-35) 

Spread: Cavaliers -2.5

Cavaliers are ahead of the Pelicans and need to stay ahead of them to finish the season. They are hot on a 5 game winning streak so let's hope that can continue tonight.

**Go Cavaliers!**

&nbsp;

Bulls (24-49) vs Rockets (60-14)

Spread: Rockets -13.5 (yesterday it was -17.5)

Rockets are sitting Harden and Capela which isn't good, but they are still a very good team and will still likely take this one. Bulls will still have the same guys out with injury plus Lauri and Valentine as questionable. Losing this game could move us up to the 7th lottery spot.

**Go Rockets!**

&nbsp;

Trail Blazers (45-28) vs Pelicans (43-31)

Spread: Pelicans -1.0

This is important not just to force the Pelicans down, but also to get the Trail Blazers a more commanding lead on the 3rd seed. As well as the Pelicans do, them getting the 3 would be worst case scenario.

**Go Trail Blazers!!!!!!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

Mavericks (22-51) vs Kings (24-50)

Spread: Kings -2.5

Kings win and we lose and we can pass the Kings for the 7th spot. Kings are playing very well of late, so I like their chances here. Mavericks win would be good too because it would put them just 1 game ahead of the Bulls, giving us a better chance to pass both them and the Kings.

**Go Kings! (or Mavericks!)**

&nbsp;

Pacers (43-31) vs Warriors (54-19)

Spread: Pacers -6.5

Pacers are tied with the Pelicans now and could move ahead of them today. They are just as crucial as the West playoff teams now that it is almost assured the Pelicans are in the playoffs.

**Go Pacers!**

&nbsp;

Bucks (39-34) vs Clippers (39-34)

Spread: Clippers -3.0

This game pretty much doesn't matter, but there's a slim slim slim chance that the Clippers catch the Pelicans so might as well root for them here.

**Go Clippers!**

"*Sorry for missing yesterday, never had the time until the games were almost over. I'll be editing this post with summaries right after I submit the outline.

So a lot of things went really well for the Bulls the last two days. We lost again to tie up the Kings (before they took the lead back with a loss), Knicks won to give us some more room behind us, Magic won the first of their tank games, and the Pelicans lost too. Right now we look very capable of moving up 2-3 spots in the draft lottery. Most important thing is that we keep losing the rest of the season, especially to the Magic and Nets.

Today there are just 5 games, and the only one that matters to the Bulls pick is the Knicks game. Nuggets and Timberwolves could do some gaining on the Pelicans though too. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Saturday's Results**

&nbsp;

Wolves(42-31) 108

76ers (41-30) 120

Wolves still behind the Pelicans, can't keep losing games at the pace they have (4-6 last 10) if they are going to help our pick. 76ers are now tied with the Pelicans though, so they could help us out if they keep winning.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Bulls (24-48) 95

Pistons(32-40) 117

Great loss, this one tied the Bulls up with the Kings before they lost the next day. The important thing is that our win total matches up with the Kings, so neither team doesn't *really* move ahead of the other until one of us wins a game. Bulls just have to keep losing and outlast the Kings, they are playing pretty well lately.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Suns (19-54) 99

Magic(21-51) 105

Magic start their streak of 6 tanks in a row, and get a win that helps us a lot. If they can get 3-4 wins from this stretch, we can definitely pass them up.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Pelicans (43-30) 91

Rockets (58-14) 114

Pelicans finally lose, winning this one would have been a really bad one for our pick. They're about evenly matched with their next 3 opponents, so if they can get 2-3 losses there they could be in danger of missing the playoffs again. 

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Lakers (31-40) 100

Grizzlies(19-53) 93

Nothing that affects either of the Bulls picks here.

**Doesn't affect either pick**

&nbsp;

Hornets (32-41) 102

Mavericks(22-50) 98

Mavericks played the Hornets close, but as usual they do not end up with the win. Mavericks are only 2.5 games ahead of the Bulls, but they are really good at closing out games to get the loss.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Cavs (44-29) 121

Nets (23-51) 114

Nets suffer yet another loss in which they had the lead going into the 4th quarter. On one hand I'm happy that they are coming so close to beating good teams like the Raptors and Cavs, because I don't usually expect much from those games. On the other hand, they really need to figure out how to close out a game, they are so close to getting some really crucial wins for us. Cavs move 1.5 games ahead of the Pelicans with this one so not all bad.

**Bad for tank, Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Spurs (43-31) 103

Bucks (39-34) 106

Spurs lose another frustrating game, right after it looked like they would close out the season strong. They can get back on track, but they gotta stop losing to teams they are better than. Bucks are out of the 8th seed now and could move up more now with Giannis back.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Heat (39-35) 107

Pacers(43-31) 113

Pacers tie up the Pelicans here, need to keep this up to finish ahead of the Pels. Heat fall back behind the Bucks in the East after a nice surge last week.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Clippers (39-34) 117

Raptors (54-20) 106

Clippers get a clutch win to keep their playoff hopes alive. It's not too realistic to see them catching the Pelicans, with them being 3.5 games back now. It's always good to have some pressure though, Pelicans could always collapse down the stretch, though that doesn't look likely either.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Knicks (27-47) 101

Wizards(40-33) 97

Knicks get a surprise win against a playoff team, finally giving us some breathing room in the lottery race. They now have 3 more wins than us, making me fairly confident we can at the very least hold the 8th pick for the rest of the year.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Celtics(50-23) 104

Kings (24-50) 93

Kings take sole possession of the 7th lottery spot back here, but they already matched our win total. Bulls just have to outlast the Kings the rest of the year, and they are playing better than us at the moment. 

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Blazers (45-28) 108

Thunder(44-31) 105

This is good because the Blazers have a more commanding lead over the Pelicans again, but bad because the Thunder are only 0.5 games ahead of the Pelicans now. Both teams have games against the Pelicans coming up so we are looking really good if they can both beat the Pels.

**Neutral for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Hawks (21-53) 99

Rockets(60-14) 118

Bulls aren't likely to pass the Hawks anyways so no big deal in this one.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Jazz (42-32) 110

Warriors(54-19) 91

Jazz take advantage of the Warriors and move to just 1 game behind the Pelicans. Jazz have a mix of tough and easy opponents the rest of the year so they need to keep playing at the top of their game.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Knicks (27-47) vs Hornets (33-41)

Spread: Hornets -11.0

Knicks just upset the Wizards, but the spread still doesn't like them very much. Hornets have been hurting us a lot lately by beating all the tanks they play, but still think the Knicks have a decent chance in this one if they play well.

**Go Knicks!**

&nbsp;

Lakers (32-40) vs Pistons (33-40)

Spread: Pistons -5.5

Both these teams and the Hornets are battling for the 10th lottery spot but they have all looked pretty decent of late. Neither team affects the Bulls so take your pick.

**Doesn't affect either pick**

&nbsp;

Nuggets (40-33) vs 76ers (42-30) 

Spread: 76ers -5.5

Nuggets are close enough to threaten the Pelicans again, need to close out the season strong to have a chance to catch them or make the playoffs. 76ers have been good lately though, and they can also benefit us with a win. I'd prefer the Nuggets to win to keep the chance of the Pelicans missing the playoffs, but that also requires the Pelicans to lose a fair amount. The safer choice would be for the 76ers to win because they are tied with the Pelicans and can more likely finish the season ahead of them.

**Go Nuggets! (or 76ers!)**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (19-54) vs Timberwolves (42-32)

Spread: Timberwolves -13.5

Timberwolves have to win this and a lot more to pass up the Pelicans. They are the 8 seed and need to secure the playoffs for themselves, but they have proven to be pretty inconsistent lately.

**Go Timberwolves!**

&nbsp;

Celtics (50-23) vs Suns (19-55)

Spread: Celtics -10.0

No way we catch the Suns so take your pick in this one.

**Take your pick, doesn't affect either pick**

"The way the front office is shutting down players it is entirely possible that the Bulls could lose out.  If they lose out, the 4th pick is within their grasp.  The bottom 3 are unreachable, but the 4th pick is realistic.  Dallas and Orlando have multiple games against tanking teams, and Brooklyn has use twice.  The Bulls are currently 1.5 games back from Dallas.  Dallas has games against Sacramento, Orlando, and Phoenix.  Hopefully, they will squeeze out two wins from those games.  The Bulls are 2.0 games back from Orlando.  Orlando has games against the Bulls, Hawks, Knicks, and Mavs.  

The math is there.  I think it is not only possible, but probable for this situation to play-out in favor of the Bulls.  Of course, any wins will complicate things.  On the flip-side, the other tanking teams could pull out W's from their games with better competition as well.  There is reason to have hope.  ","Tanked full of optimism.

"*Not a ton of time today so this will be pretty basic

Not too bad a day yesterday, Bulls lost and most of the games went our way. Nets almost pulled a super upset but faded in the 4th as usual. If the Pelicans lose we'll have a lot of teams ready to jump on them soon.

Today not a lot of games but a pretty big day. We have another game, this time the Pistons. Magic start their streak against other tanks, Pelicans play the Rockets (maybe they'll finally lose), and the Mavericks have a winnable game too.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Clippers (38-33) 104

Pacers (41-31) 109

Pacers closer to the Pelicans now but Clippers almost definitely don't catch them now.

**Good for Pelicans pick, also Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Nuggets (39-33) 108

Wizards (40-31) 100

Nuggets still could catch the Pelicans if they keep playing well.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Suns (19-53) 95

Cavaliers (42-29) 120

Cavs get the needed win, need to keep it up to finish ahead of Pelicans.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Wolves (41-31) 108

Knicks (26-46) 104

Good to see Knicks playing the Wolves close and good that the Wolves are still close to Pels. Bad though that the Knicks are still hot on our tail.

**Bad for tank, Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Nets (23-49) 112

Raptors (53-19) 116

I'm happy that the Nets were able to play so well against a top team, , but so frustrating when they lose in the end. 

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Bucks (37-34) 118

Bulls (24-47) 105

Actually got to go to this one, first game of the year. Man was it scary when Payne could score at will in the first quarter, but Bucks pulled it together in the 4th to secure the game. Good loss for us, gotta keep losing to stay close to all the other teams we can catch.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Heat (39-33) 99

Thunder (43-30) 105

Good for Thunder, gotta stay ahead of the Pelicans.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Jazz (41-31) 

Spurs (42-30)

Glad the Spurs are winning a lot to get ahead of the Pelicans but the Jazz need to get another win streak going so they aren't stuck in the 8th seed.

**Good for Pelicans pick, also Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Celtics (48-23) 105

Blazers (44-27) 100

Trail Blazers had a healthy lead but are now getting dangerously close to the Pelicans again.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Hawks (21-51) 94

Warriors (53-18) 106

No big deal, we weren't likely catching the Hawks anyways.

"Chicago Chicago, with so much bravado

Your story is one with indeed much sorrow

Tank season has begun, and we find solace in Markkanen 

Just as he is finnish – so is our season

But let me take you on a journey of how we got here to begin with

&nbsp;

The first pick in the draft, with a 1 percent chance

Would he live up to his hype? Only time would tell us that

A Rose that grew in the concrete - jungle

His task - to fill the shoes of some [untouchabulls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZMVKN3W1JE)

He was the Westbrook before Westbrook

The Rook had so much flair

His legs were trampolines – others were aware

To [get out of his way or you would rue the day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRAp00SxP30)

&nbsp;

That a kid from Englewood would lay you out on the hardwood

Those years were special, forget Tyrus, Gordon, Wallace and even Aldridge

We finally had someone that would take us to the promise

Land – is where he lived, a man among boys – King was his name – players were his toys

When Free agency hit – we gathered to grab him

Derrick Rose and LeBron James? That would be Magic

&nbsp;

We could see the light like there was no tomorrow

It didn’t work out – but we held our own

&nbsp;

62-20 – the first in the East

We rode high – no longer hiding under the sheets

We had a chance at the Trophy – in our way was a Beast

A three-headed monster who brought the [Heat](http://4hdwallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Miami-Heat-Wallpaper.png)

We tried hard – but eventually were beat

Next season, we said – and moved on from [defeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgLMI784M4E)

&nbsp;

But as the the stanza’s in this poem - our dreams turned to nightmares

From why not me? to please oh please not the knees!

[Our MVP - fell in the 4th - after soaring through the air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo1UlzDeY-o)

He would never be the same, and it seemed we would lose our heir

&nbsp;

Injury after Injury - he loved this city

[He teared up on stage – how could anyone pity?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs-YE5AKlOU)

A young boy who played for the place that sprung him

But they came out in full force – and hated more than they loved him

&nbsp;

He took that pain and used it as fuel

“Made of glass” they would say – how I pity those fools

But our number was called – and with patience there's perseverance

A new rookie in town - would become a solid second

He went by the name, Jimmy G. Buckets

And with the pain – Derrick carried on his shoulders

[We almost saw the day – we finally might have slayed the monster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAIqHc31FS8)


&nbsp;


That is LeBron James - but as Thibs came and gone – another took the reigns

The team was a skeleton of it’s former days 

They played with heart – but rumors came 

A conflict between the one and the two

Either he stays or I leave – the choice is up to you

&nbsp;

Our Rose – conflicted, hurt, and troubled

Thus began the decline of Chicago basketball

&nbsp;

Sad that is Chicago sports – when one team does good, the others tend to suffer

First it’s the Bears, then the Hawks, then after the Northsiders

I guess now’s the time that Bulls continue this cycle

&nbsp;

I wish the best to former players – coaches – and staff

As we continue this humble climb down the stands

I think the real misfortune of this story we have goes

The tragedy is that we never had a chance to see our flower blossom and grow –

[**Derrick Rose**.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tX2w3jCNFPs)","An ode to Chicago. Chicago Chicago, with so much bravado

Your story is one with indeed much sorrow

Tank season has begun, and we find solace in Markkanen 

Just as he is finnish – so is our season

But let me take you on a journey of how we got here to begin with

&nbsp;

The first pick in the draft, with a 1 percent chance

Would he live up to his hype? Only time would tell us that

A Rose that grew in the concrete - jungle

His task - to fill the shoes of some [untouchabulls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZMVKN3W1JE)

He was the Westbrook before Westbrook

The Rook had so much flair

His legs were trampolines – others were aware

To [get out of his way or you would rue the day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRAp00SxP30)

&nbsp;

That a kid from Englewood would lay you out on the hardwood

Those years were special, forget Tyrus, Gordon, Wallace and even Aldridge

We finally had someone that would take us to the promise

Land – is where he lived, a man among boys – King was his name – players were his toys

When Free agency hit – we gathered to grab him

Derrick Rose and LeBron James? That would be Magic

&nbsp;

We could see the light like there was no tomorrow

It didn’t work out – but we held our own

&nbsp;

62-20 – the first in the East

We rode high – no longer hiding under the sheets

We had a chance at the Trophy – in our way was a Beast

A three-headed monster who brought the [Heat](http://4hdwallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Miami-Heat-Wallpaper.png)

We tried hard – but eventually were beat

Next season, we said – and moved on from [defeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgLMI784M4E)

&nbsp;

But as the the stanza’s in this poem - our dreams turned to nightmares

From why not me? to please oh please not the knees!

[Our MVP - fell in the 4th - after soaring through the air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo1UlzDeY-o)

He would never be the same, and it seemed we would lose our heir

&nbsp;

Injury after Injury - he loved this city

[He teared up on stage – how could anyone pity?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs-YE5AKlOU)

A young boy who played for the place that sprung him

But they came out in full force – and hated more than they loved him

&nbsp;

He took that pain and used it as fuel

“Made of glass” they would say – how I pity those fools

But our number was called – and with patience there's perseverance

A new rookie in town - would become a solid second

He went by the name, Jimmy G. Buckets

And with the pain – Derrick carried on his shoulders

[We almost saw the day – we finally might have slayed the monster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAIqHc31FS8)


&nbsp;


That is LeBron James - but as Thibs came and gone – another took the reigns

The team was a skeleton of it’s former days 

They played with heart – but rumors came 

A conflict between the one and the two

Either he stays or I leave – the choice is up to you

&nbsp;

Our Rose – conflicted, hurt, and troubled

Vented to the press – that he wanted to mellow

And see his child walk across the stage

[And how quickly the tides turned once again that they mocked and hazed](http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/11/charles-barkley-derrick-rose-injury-tnt-inside-the-nba)

&nbsp;

Forgetting that they he played with so much ferocity

Forgetting he played with so much heart and passion

Oh, those years of joy - would come and go in a crude fashion

"The Bulls lost, which is the most important part of yesterday, but it was so close to being a really good day for us. Nets played great and had a huge lead on the Hornets, until they blew a 23 point lead to lose it. Pacers had a lot of chances to beat the Pelicans but just couldn't put them away when it mattered. 

The 4th quarter keeps killing us in all of the games around the league. It's when the tanks throw away their leads and when the Pelicans turn it on to win. It makes sense, bad teams vs good team in the clutch, but it doesn't make it any less frustrating.

Today we got several games that matter to us. Two of the teams we're chasing, the Kings and Mavericks, play today (and the Kings have a great matchup against the Hawks). Pelicans play the last of their 5 games in 6 days against the Lakers. That stretch is already a bit of a failure considering they will come out with more wins than losses, but we need the Lakers to play well to salvage at least a couple losses. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Raptors (53-18) 129

Cavaliers(41-29) 132

Cavs pull out a big win against the Raptors thank to Lebron pulling out a historic statline of 35 points, 17 assists, 0 turnovers. This helps the Bulls, as the Cavs stay ahead of the Pelicans by a bit.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies(19-51) 105

76ers (39-30) 119

76ers keep rolling and are still just a game behind the Pelicans. They lead the whole game and were able to coast to an easy victory. 

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Hornets(30-41) 111

Nets (23-48) 105

Oh my God the Nets... I don't know how but I made the same mistake for the 100th time of checking the score in the second half and thinking ""Yes! No way the Nets blow that big of a lead."" They were up 19 at the half, up 23 midway through the 3rd quarter, they even still had an 11 point lead halfway through the 4th quarter. But all of that was erased by the Hornets in the end. Howard was the biggest reason the Hornets were able to come back, he ended with 32 points, 30 rebounds, and had more offensive rebounds (11) than any play on the Nets had total rebounds. As pissed as I am that they lost in the end, The Nets did just have a 2 game winning streak, and would have made it 3 if they didn't get manhandled by Howard, so it is still a good sign that the Nets might finish the season strong(ish).

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Knicks(26-45) 98

Heat (38-33) 119

Heat played well and Knicks were down big most of the game. Knicks stay only 1.5 games back of us, always ready to strike if we get a win.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Nuggets(38-33) 135

Bulls (24-46) 102

Another great win for the Bulls, taking full advantage of being without our best players. Nuggets pretty much just gradually grew their lead all game. We don't gain on any teams because the other tanks lost too, but every night with a Bulls loss is still a good night for the tank.

Felicio lead the team in scoring again, not something I was expecting even without our best players. I'm not sure when we're getting any players back but We need to carry on this losing streak either way, preferably until the end of the season.

**Good for tank, Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Clippers(37-33) 127

Bucks (37-33) 120

Clippers break their losing streak but don't gain on the Pelicans since they won too. Not looking too likely the Clippers can make their way back into the playoffs.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Pacers (41-30) 92

Pelicans (41-30) 96

A team was finally able to limit the Pelicans offense to less that 100 points! Too bad it was also the night that the Pacers shot 36% from the field. Pacers were just never able to get on enough of a run to put the Pelicans away. For the entire first half of the game, neither teams was able to lead by more than 4 points. Pelicans will now end their 5 tough games with at least 3 wins, with a possible 4th today if they can beat the Lakers.

**Bad for Pelicans pick x2**

&nbsp;

Wizards(40-30) 90

Spurs (41-30) 98

Spurs get a much needed win to stay tied with the Pelicans. Need to keep it up for the rest of the season because the Pelicans don't look like they are losing much.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (19-52) vs Hornets (31-41)

Spread: Hornets -8.5

We don't catch the Grizzlies and the Hornets are nowhere near us or Pelicans so take your pick in this one.

**Neither team affects us, take your pick**

&nbsp;

76ers (40-30) vs Magic (21-50)

Spread: 76ers -8.0

Magic are still 3 games ahead of us, but following this game they play: Suns, Nets, Bulls, Hawks, Knicks, Mavericks, Hornets. It's very possible for them to get enough wins over that stretch for us to catch them in the lottery race. If they can upset the 76ers tonight, that would be the perfect way to start the stretch.

**Go Magic!**

&nbsp;

Pistons (32-39) vs Rockets (57-14) 

Spread: Rockets -12.5

Neither team will affect our picks, but if you're really looking for someone to cheer for, the Pistons winning could be indirectly good for us. They play the Bulls Saturday, and some momentum from upsetting the top team in the league would be pretty good to help them beat us.

**Neither team affects us, take your pick**

&nbsp;

Lakers (31-39) vs Pelicans (42-30)

Spread: Pelicans -2.0

Pelicans have just played 2 close games back to back, and now finish up against the Lakers. Lakers looked pretty good until their current 3 game losing streak, so they really need to turn it back on to take down the Pelicans. Their pick has been steadily rising and we really need a couple losses to get them back down into the teens.

**Go Lakers!**

&nbsp;

Jazz (40-31) vs Mavericks (22-49)

Spread: Jazz -8.5

Jazz are playing really well but also just lost to the Hawks, so Mavericks could still take this. Mavs are only 2 games ahead of the Bulls, need to get a few wins soon so that we can have the opportunity to catch them. Jazz win is good too because they are 1.5 games behind the Pelicans in the West.

**Go Mavericks!**

&nbsp;

Hawks (21-50) vs Kings (23-49)

Spread: Kings -1.5

Kings are 1.5 games ahead of the Bulls now, but if they won tonight, they would actually tie our win total since we have 2 games in hand. Over the last 10 games of their season, the Kings will play 4 tanks and 1 other non-playoff team (Lakers). If they can pick up 3-4 wins over those last 10, we could definitely pass them. Big one tonight though, as the Hawks are fresh off upsetting the Jazz 

**Go Kings!**

"Out of the seven games yesterday only one went our way, and that was the one where either result would have been okay. It hurt the Pelicans pick quite a bit, with the Pelicans gaining on the Thunder, Jazz, Trail Blazers, and extending over the Pistons.

Today is a much more important day, with the Pelicans playing a tougher team, Nets and Knicks playing winnable games, and of course our game against the Nuggets. Bulls have a good chance to get a bigger lead on the Knicks and/or catch up to the Nets today, which would be really huge for us.


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Raptors(52-18) 93

Magic (21-49) 86

Magic actually had an 8 point lead going into the 4th quarter, but they managed to score only 10 points in the 4th to pull out the loss. This could be a good sign for their upcoming tank gauntlet though.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Thunder(43-29) 99

Celtics (47-23) 100

Thunder just go up and down all game, never consistent enough to put the game away and it cost them. Morris hit the game winner with a second left to win it. Thunder are now only 1 game ahead of the Pelicans in the West.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Clippers(37-32) 109

Wolves (40-31) 123

This is good because the Timberwolves stay only 0.5 games back of the Pelicans in the West, but also bad because the Clippers fall 3.5 games behind the Pelicans to kick them out of the playoffs. It looks a lot more likely that the Pelicans make the playoffs now, so we're going to need the teams in the East to win even more now, and also hope the Pelicans can fall the the 8 seed at the very least.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Mavericks(22-48) 105

Pelicans (40-30) 115

Mavericks got our hopes up by keeping it really close throughout, even tied it going into the 4th, but managed to lose it in the end. Davis scored 37 points on just 21 shots, and it was just too much for the Mavs. The result was expected, but the Pelicans will now be playing in harder games to win and the Mavs will be playing harder games to lose.

**Bad for tank, Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Hawks(20-50) 99

Jazz (40-30) 94

Just like the Grizzlies, when I've finally given up on catching the Hawks, they turn around and beat a team that is competing with the Pelicans. The Hawks are still 3.5 games ahead of the Bulls so I still don't think we're going to catch them even with this upset win. Jazz lose their 9 game winning streak and are now a game behind the Pelicans in the West.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Pistons(31-39) 115

Suns (19-52) 88

Neither team is close enough to affect either of our pick, unless the Suns get really hot so no big deal in this one.

**No affect on either pick**

&nbsp;

Rockets(56-14) 115

Blazers (44-26) 111

Trail Blazers are still 3 games ahead of the Pelicans, and I still think they're too good to get caught. Every game matters though, and they need to get right back to winning for us to be safe.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Raptors(53-18) vs Cavaliers (41-29)

Spread: Cavaliers -2.0

Pelicans look like they are making the playoffs so we really need the Cavs to get ahead of them and improve our draft pick. Not sure if DeRozan is playing after sitting yesterday with a bone bruise so we'll see there.

**Go Cavaliers!**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (19-51) vs 76ers (39-30)

Spread: 76ers -12.0

76ers are just a game back of the Pelicans and playing pretty good right now on a 3 game win streak. Grizzlies are out of reach so they might as well just keep losing the rest of the season to help the teams that can help us.

**Go 76ers!**

&nbsp;

Hornets (30-41) vs Nets (23-48) 

Spread: Hornets -1.5

Nets have looked better lately and they are now just one win away from matching our total. If I remember right though, they have struggled this year against the Hornets so we need the Nets to come with their best tonight. If they won and the Bulls lost, we would be just 0.5 games behind them with a game in hand. We have our two games against the Nets late, but in case of a split it would be really nice to already be leading the Nets in the lottery race.

**Go Nets!**

&nbsp;

Knicks (26-45) vs Heat (38-33)

Spread: Pelicans -11.0

Heat are playing really well lately, as evidence by the huge spread tonight. They have shown in the past that they don't hold their hot streaks for long, and they could definitely lose to the Knicks with a bad game tonight. Knicks are on a 2 game win streak, but they are still the Knicks and will have a tough time losing this.

**Go Knicks!**

&nbsp;

Nuggets (38-33) vs Bulls (24-46)

Spread: Nuggets -9.5

Our big three are out again tonight, making it a lot easier to pick up another big L. We need to keep losing to have any chance to gain on the Nets, Mavericks, and Kings. We can help our Pelicans pick too, with the Nuggets being the closest team to knocking the Pelicans out of the playoffs.

**Go Nuggets!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

Clippers (37-33) vs Bucks (37-33)

Spread: Bucks -5.0

Clippers played really well until they got a playoff spot, and now they're on a 4 game losing streak. That really hurts our chances of the Pelicans missing the playoffs, but if the Clips can turn it around and the Pelicans lose enough, it's still possible. Bucks have also been inconstant lately, could go either way here

**Go Clippers!**

&nbsp;

Pacers (41-30) vs Pelicans (41-30)

Spread: Pelicans -1.0

Luckily with the Mavericks playing the Pelicans so close last night, the Pelicans weren't able to rest their starters much for their game tonight. Pacers are tied with the Pelicans and can help us by both getting the Pelicans a loss, and also by going ahead of them to improve our pick. We need these next two games to go against the Pelicans, it would be a missed opportunity if they only lost one or two over this hard five game stretch.

**Go Pacers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

Wizards (40-30) vs Spurs (41-30)

Spread: Spurs -6.0

Spurs are tied with the Pelicans, very important for every West team to get ahead of the Pels and stay ahead. Wizards win wouldn't be too bad though, as we need East teams to get ahead of the Pelicans too.

**Go Spurs!**

"Zach’s upcoming free agency has been a hot topic around here. Many have been skeptical about giving him 20 plus million based on a few factors including him shooting 38% since he’s been back and a few other factors. However, I don’t think there is any hesitation from the Bulls side and that they already have an understanding with Zach and his representation. 

My reasoning on this is that they have been extremely conservative with Zach and Zach seems to be totally fine with it. If Zach was auditioning for a massive contract I can’t imagine him being ok without being able to get out of his slump and show teams he can be a number one option and a max player. His comments yesterday about being careful with his return from the tendinitis made it sound like it is the bulls decision and he is completely ok with it. 

I may be overthinking it, but the entire approach and atmosphere surrounding Zach feels more like the handling of a player they have locked into a big deal already instead of a player trying to earn his next deal. ","Theory: I think the Bulls and Lavine have a tentative agreement on a contract already Zach’s upcoming free agency has been a hot topic around here. Many have been skeptical about giving him 20 plus million based on a few factors including him shooting 38% since he’s been back and a few other factors. However, I don’t think there is any hesitation from the Bulls side and that they already have an understanding with Zach and his representation. 

My reasoning on this is that they have been extremely conservative with Zach and Zach seems to be totally fine with it.

"Another really good day for the tank yesterday, we're starting to improve our chances of moving up in the draft again. Losing to the Knicks gave us a nice cushion from falling to 9th, and the Nets win brings them to just 1.5 games ahead of us. Most of the teams benefitting the Pelicans pick won too, the only games that didn't go our way were the Kings losing and the Nuggets losing in OT.

Today the only team that really affects the Bulls pick is the Mavericks, and we need to root extra hard for them because they play the Pelicans. That is easily the biggest game, and other than that there a few other teams chasing the Pelicans that could get some wins today too. But focus all of your energy into rooting for the Mavericks to win tonight!


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Bucks(37-32) 117

Cavs (40-29) 124

Lebron scored 40 and had a triple double to beat Giannis's 37 points and a double double. Cavaliers stay ahead of the Pelicans, they are now 1 game ahead if the Pelicans make the playoffs. 

**Good for the Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Lakers (31-38) 100

Pacers (40-30) 110

Lakers were up for pretty much the whole first half, but then the Pacers took the lead for the second half. Pacers go up 0.5 games on the Pelicans for now.

**Good for the Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Hornets(30-40) 94

76ers (38-30) 108

76ers are 0.5 games behind the Pelicans, and it's becoming more important that the East teams that are below the Pelicans to win. The Clippers and Nuggets are sputtering a little and look like they might not be able to force the Pelicans out, so we need all the bottom East playoff teams to do as well as possible to force the Pelicans lower.

**Good for Pelicans pick!**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies(19-50) 115

Nets (22-48) 118

Grizzlies scared me and I really thought they were gonna get another bad win, but the Nets pulled it off in the end. The Nets are now 1.5 games ahead of us, which is the gap we need to keep to be able to catch them with our two games against them later. 

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Nuggets(38-32) 141

Heat (37-33) 149

(ended in 2OT) Nuggets are going cold at the worst time, fading even further from the playoffs. They are now 2.5 games behind the Pelicans and running out of time to get their game back. Heat on the other hand might be able to benefit us if they keep playing well and can pass the Pelicans.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Bulls (24-45) 92

Knicks(25-45) 110

Great loss for the Bulls last night, we kept the 8th spot and gave ourselves a little more room from the Knicks catching us. We are also now only 1.5 games behind the Nets, and still have the Mavs and Kings within reach too at 2 games back. Bulls play some better teams coming up, but most of them aren't auto-losses so keeping the losing streak is going to be tough.

We mostly lost due to shooting just 36% including shooting exactly 10% from 3. There were some great tank performances from Zipser and Payne, and there was a surprisingly nice game from Felicio. Shrek knocked down 8 of his 10 shots and had a sweet chase down block. 

**Good for tank x2**

&nbsp;

Warriors(53-17) 75

Spurs (40-30) 89

The already injured Warriors lost Green in this one too, now have all 4 of their all-stars injured. They still managed a comeback to take the lead in the early 4th, but the Spurs buried them after that. Spurs are now on a 4 game winning streak, but they are still just 0.5 games ahead of the Pelicans in the West.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Pistons(30-39) 106

Kings (23-48) 90

I was really hoping for a Kings win in this one, and they kept it close for most of the game until the Pistons ran away with it in the 3rd. Kings are still only 2 games ahead of us and play 2 tanks in their next 3 games.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Raptors (52-18) vs Magic (21-49)

Spread: Raptors -10.5

Magic are 3 games ahead of us, but after this game they will be playing a ton of tanks all in a row. They could definitely get several wins there to get back within reach of us. A win here would be a great start, but probably won't happen

**Go Magic!**

&nbsp;

Thunder (43-29) vs Celtics (47-23)

Spread: Thunder -4.5

Celtics are still short Kyrie and Brown, and we need the Thunder to take advantage to stay ahead of the Pelicans. Pelicans are 2 games back of the Thunder right now

**Go Thunder!**

&nbsp;

Clippers (37-32) vs Timberwolves (40-31) 

Spread: Timberwolves -4.0

This is close because I really want the Clippers to win to be able to force the Pelicans out of the playoffs, but the Timberwolves are closer and are much more likely to pass the Pelicans. Wolves are just 0.5 games back and need to win as much as possible to force the Pelicans back into the 8th seed at the very least. Also even if the Clippers don't catch the Pelicans, Nuggets still have a shot there.

**Go Timberwolves!**

&nbsp;

Mavericks (22-48) vs Pelicans (40-30)

Spread: Pelicans -9.0

Biggest game of the night, the Bulls can get a massive boost to both of their draft picks if the Mavs can come out and upset the Pelicans. Mavericks will be without Smith Jr though, and haven't looked to good of late. If they do manage to win, it would put them just 1.5 games ahead of us and force the Pelicans back into the 8th seed.

**Go Mavericks!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

Hawks (20-50) vs Jazz (40-30)

Spread: Jazz -13.5

Hawks are too far away to catch, especially with their hard schedule. Jazz are tied up with the Pelicans for the 6th seed and are on a 9 game winning streak. They could do us a huge favor by keeping that up and passing the Pelicans for good.

**Go Jazz!**

&nbsp;

Pistons (31-39) vs Suns (19-52)

Spread: Pistons -6.5

Suns would have to play over .500 for the rest of the season AND we would have to lose out for us to catch them. But theres a better chance of that happening than the Pistons affecting either of our draft pick so might as well root for the Suns.

**Go Suns!**

&nbsp;

Rockets (56-14) vs Trail Blazers (44-26)

Spread: Rockets -5.0

Trail Blazers have a healthy 4 game lead over the Pelicans and probably won't get caught by them. The bigger the lead the better though, so lets hope for the Blazers to take that winning streak to 14.

**Go Trail Blazers!**

"Hey so I know we're getting real hyped in this sub about the possibility of Porter slipping to our pick or Mikal Bridges becoming the new Kawhi but I feel like we need to address the things to be concerned about as much as we talk about their strengths. I'll ignore Ayton and Doncic for rn, as I think not only are we out of the running on those two, but their weaknesses are pretty well-documented. To be clear: The point of this is not to say anyone here is undraftable, but rather to lower the frenzy over certain prospects to a realistic level. 

###Mikal Bridges###
A lot of buzz has been made about Mikal's frame, and it's partially understandable. His wingspan is awesome, he's got versatile length that makes people say he can guard 1000 positions. What we're ignoring is how slim he is. Watch the games where Justin Holiday is asked to guard someone like LeBron and you'll see how important muscle is in conjunction with length. Nwaba is not a long guy, but he's strong, and he's at least *as* effective as Holiday at guarding SGs and SFs. Mikal is 210 lbs (per Tankathon). David Nwaba is 3 inches shorter and weighs 209 (per bbref). He's simply got an NBA frame that Bridges lacks. Butler and Kawhi had filled-out frames when they came into the league. That strength was hugely formative for their defensive ability. We've also talked a little in this sub about the middling shot creation aspect of Bridges' game, but it's worth re-mentioning: this dude is near-pitiful at self-creation or creation for others. Jay Wright and Jalen Brunson do a great job at keeping the offense moving, but Bridges is a very low-ceiling passer and is hugely inefficient with anything on offense that requires dribbling. The chances he ever becomes a go-to guy on offense (regardless of his offensive improvements at Nova over the years) are pretty slim. 

###Michael Porter Jr.###
Billed as any number of ridiculous NBA successors (Kevin Durant being much more popular than it should be), Porter hasn't really blown people away in the few games he played for Mizzou. The shot creation, which was never in doubt, is still there; he has a terrific release point and he knows how to get into a rhythm motion for his shot with minimal load time. However, opponents will be longer, faster, and stronger in the NBA than *anything* Porter saw in his brief time with Mizzou, and so Porter’s **inability to turn the corner** at the collegiate level is concerning. Some of this may be attributed to his back injury, but Mizzou held him out to the point that Porter was supposed to already be at 100 percent. He took 17 shots in his return game versus Georgia. Who does that when they’re only at, as Porter himself said post-game, 70 percent? In addition, there’s good reason to wonder where Porter fits in an NBA scheme. He’s likely not fast enough to be the scorer he’s expected to be if he’s playing SF, but can he slide down PF and add muscle without taking away from his already-middle-of-the-road breakaway speed? Porter’s ceiling as a star two-way forward is fantastic, but there are very real concerns that could prevent him from reaching it. 

###Marvin Bagley###
A fair bit has been said about Bagley’s weaknesses, namely that he’s extremely right-hand dominant, struggles in the midrange, and most frustratingly, he lacks any real defensive IQ. Much has been made of Duke relying on zone defense despite having six NBA-caliber players on their roster, and the biggest culprit here is Bagley. Too lean to shut down the heftier bigs, too distracted to stop the P&R, Bagley’s defensive future in the NBA is murky at best. He’s not very long (6’11, 7’0 wingspan) and while he rebounds extremely well with a terrific second jump, he’s not altogether a freak athlete. He’ll likely be the worst defender in any starting lineup, but the hope is obviously that he’s not an absolute liability and can make up for it on offense.

###Mo Bamba###
Bamba is billed as a freak athlete, but his length is deceiving. Bamba can get over people on a jam, but it’s more a testament to his freakish wingspan than to any unorthodox degree of explosion. Bamba can be Rudy Gobert, sure, but he could equally be Javale McGee. His speed off the ground is lacking, his motor on the glass is underwhelming, and he needs to desperately add muscle if he wants to be a full-power post defender. He’s lost on the perimeter, as his straight-line quickness does not translate laterally. In addition, foot injuries on a guy that big this early are extremely concerning. His quick hands (on tree limb arms) and budding ability to spread the floor are tantalizing, but he’ll get son’d by heftier or smarter guys if he can’t adapt. 

###Trae Young###
I’m a self-admitted Young-hater so take that into account when reading this list. Young is small. His physical tools are worse than subpar. He’s slight of build, short, and has a wingspan as long as Tyler Ulis’. In addition, don’t think for a second Young has the preternatural vision of Lonzo Ball. He makes a lot of terrific reads, yes. He’s also on a team where a lot of his supporting cast is finishing at the rim. His assist numbers are good, but factor in that they’re inflated by high USG% and the OU roster. His defensive anticipation isn’t bad, but he simply doesn’t have the athleticism or body to make the play even if he sees it developing. I see the ceiling with Trae; I understand the hype of a guy with tight handles and a great jumper. Unfortunately, I think his limitations physically prevent him from ever reaching that peak for a sustained period of time. 

###Miles Bridges###
Often viewed as the “lesser” of two Bridges, Miles has a lot of positives (powerful body, good-but-not-elite explosion, flashes as a playmaker, great defensive rebounding) but a mediocre wingspan (6’8.5”) forces him to make some gambles and difficult decisions defensively more often than you might like. Means he bites on a lot of pump fakes. Bridges is shooting well from beyond the arc, but keep in mind that MSU’s offense generates most of those looks as spot-ups, not as anything remotely off-dribble, which is where Bridges collapses as a shot-maker. His versatility is still impressive, but he’s not going to be going full Westbrook (even though he looks just like him) taking nano-second pull-ups from anywhere <25ft. Bridges does the same thing LaVine does, where he catches the ball, forms an idea of what he’s gonna do, and then tunnel-visions the fuck out of the possession until he’s completed his desired action. Obviously that leads to mixed results. 

###Jaren Jackson Jr.###
JJJ has shot up draft boards in the second half of the season, and understandably so. He’s seen as the best parts of Mo Bamba with better explosion, shooting ability, and motor. Jackson’s strengths sound remarkably similar to the things that made Marquese Chriss such a tantalizing prospect. Unfortunately, so do his weaknesses. JJJ struggles with foul trouble, creation ability for himself and others, and playmaking. Despite his athletic gifts and skill, Jackson is likely never gonna be the guy grabbing the rebound, running it up the court himself, and initiating the offense. Instead, he’s more likely to grab the rebound, hand it off, and run ahead to either screen-and-pop/roll or camp out on the baseline. If it sounds like these are liveable downsides, it’s because they are—I’m very high on JJJ’s potential and am convinced he fits as a starter on nearly any team in the NBA. 

###Wendell Carter###
Carter may be the easier Duke big to deploy in most NBA schemes due to his defensive ability as a shot-blocker and an effective 2-4 second stopper in switch situations. His jumper mechanics are solid, but there’s definite concern that he won’t adjust well to the NBA 3 right away—think how long it took Al Horford. In addition, while Carter’s thiccness (257 lb) has been mostly looked at as a positive, most big men add weight as they mature. 257 doesn’t give Carter a whole lot of room for addition (think Jared Sullinger) and could leave him in an uncomfortable position in even just 5 years. Also of note is that while Carter has longer arms than Bagley (7’3 wingspan), he stands around 6’9.5, which is far from elite center height. His explosion isn’t great either, so while he’s a smart rim protector at the college level, it’s going to get a lot more difficult when he’s up against longer, faster, smarter attacking players with his middle-of-the-pack tools. 



*I'd love feedback on this, y'all. If you want me to run through it for guys projected around the Pels pick, I can do that too. If you hate it, sorry. I took like 40min on this, so it's not a huge loss.*","Talking the Cons on Rookies in Our Range Hey so I know we're getting real hyped in this sub about the possibility of Porter slipping to our pick or Mikal Bridges becoming the new Kawhi but I feel like we need to address the things to be concerned about as much as we talk about their strengths. I'll ignore Ayton and Doncic for rn, as I think not only are we out of the running on those two, but their weaknesses are pretty well-documented. To be clear: The point of this is not to say anyone here is undraftable, but rather to lower the frenzy over certain prospects to a realistic level. 

###Mikal Bridges###
A lot of buzz has been made about Mikal's frame, and it's partially understandable. His wingspan is awesome, he's got versatile length that makes people say he can guard 1000 positions. What we're ignoring is how slim he is. Watch the games where Justin Holiday is asked to guard someone like LeBron and you'll see how important muscle is in conjunction with length. Nwaba is not a long guy, but he's strong, and he's at least *as* effective as Holiday at guarding SGs and SFs. Mikal is 210 lbs (per Tankathon). David Nwaba is 3 inches shorter and weighs 209 (per bbref). He's simply got an NBA frame that Bridges lacks. Butler and Kawhi had filled-out frames when they came into the league. That strength was hugely formative for their defensive ability. We've also talked a little in this sub about the middling shot creation aspect of Bridges' game, but it's worth re-mentioning: this dude is near-pitiful at self-creation or creation for others. Jay Wright and Jalen Brunson do a great job at keeping the offense moving, but Bridges is a very low-ceiling passer and is hugely inefficient with anything on offense that requires dribbling. The chances he ever becomes a go-to guy on offense (regardless of his offensive improvements at Nova over the years) are pretty slim. 

###Michael Porter Jr.###
Billed as any number of ridiculous NBA successors (Kevin Durant being much more popular than it should be), Porter hasn't really blown people away in the few games he played for Mizzou. The shot creation, which was never in doubt, is still there; he has a terrific release point and he knows how to get into a rhythm motion for his shot with minimal load time. However, opponents will be longer, faster, and stronger in the NBA than *anything* Porter saw in his brief time with Mizzou, and so Porter’s **inability to turn the corner** at the collegiate level is concerning. Some of this may be attributed to his back injury, but Mizzou held him out to the point that Porter was supposed to already be at 100 percent. He took 17 shots in his return game versus Georgia. Who does that when they’re only at, as Porter himself said post-game, 70 percent? In addition, there’s good reason to wonder where Porter fits in an NBA scheme. He’s likely not fast enough to be the scorer he’s expected to be if he’s playing SF, but can he slide down PF and add muscle without taking away from his already-middle-of-the-road breakaway speed? Porter’s ceiling as a star two-way forward is fantastic, but there are very real concerns that could prevent him from reaching it. 

###Marvin Bagley###
A fair bit has been said about Bagley’s weaknesses, namely that he’s extremely right-hand dominant, struggles in the midrange, and most frustratingly, he lacks any real defensive IQ. Much has been made of Duke relying on zone defense despite having six NBA-caliber players on their roster, and the biggest culprit here is Bagley. Too lean to shut down the heftier bigs, too distracted to stop the P&R, Bagley’s defensive future in the NBA is murky at best. He’s not very long (6’11, 7’0 wingspan) and while he rebounds extremely well with a terrific second jump, he’s not altogether a freak athlete. He’ll likely be the worst defender in any starting lineup, but the hope is obviously that he’s not an absolute liability and can make up for it on offense.

###Mo Bamba###
Bamba is billed as a freak athlete, but his length is deceiving. Bamba can get over people on a jam, but it’s more a testament to his freakish wingspan than to any unorthodox degree of explosion. Bamba can be Rudy Gobert, sure, but he could equally be Javale McGee. His speed off the ground is lacking, his motor on the glass is underwhelming, and he needs to desperately add muscle if he wants to be a full-power post defender. He’s lost on the perimeter, as his straight-line quickness does not translate laterally. In addition, foot injuries on a guy that big this early are extremely concerning. His quick hands (on tree limb arms) and budding ability to spread the floor are tantalizing, but he’ll get son’d by heftier or smarter guys if he can’t adapt. 

###Trae Young###
I’m a self-admitted Young-hater so take that into account when reading this list. Young is small. His physical tools are worse than subpar. He’s slight of build, short, and has a wingspan as long as Tyler Ulis’. In addition, don’t think for a second Young has the preternatural vision of Lonzo Ball. He makes a lot of terrific reads, yes. He’s also on a team where a lot of his supporting cast is finishing at the rim. His assist numbers are good, but factor in that they’re inflated by high USG% and the OU roster. His defensive anticipation isn’t bad, but he simply doesn’t have the athleticism or body to make the play even if he sees it developing. I see the ceiling with Trae; I understand the hype of a guy with tight handles and a great jumper. Unfortunately, I think his limitations physically prevent him from ever reaching that peak for a sustained period of time. 

###Miles Bridges###
Often viewed as the “lesser” of two Bridges, Miles has a lot of positives (powerful body, good-but-not-elite explosion, flashes as a playmaker, great defensive rebounding) but a mediocre wingspan (6’8.5”) forces him to make some gambles and difficult decisions defensively more often than you might like. Means he bites on a lot of pump fakes. Bridges is shooting well from beyond the arc, but keep in mind that MSU’s offense generates most of those looks as spot-ups, not as anything remotely off-dribble, which is where Bridges collapses as a shot-maker. His versatility is still impressive, but he’s not going to be going full Westbrook (even though he looks just like him) taking nano-second pull-ups from anywhere <25ft. Bridges does the same thing LaVine does, where he catches the ball, forms an idea of what he’s gonna do, and then tunnel-visions the fuck out of the possession until he’s completed his desired action. Obviously that leads to mixed results.

"Not the best day yesterday, but not a huge deal as there weren't too many games. Pelicans move up a little in the West but they are still very vulnerable to missing the playoffs.

Today is a huge game for the Bulls to keep the 8th lottery spot. There are also a couple chances for tanks to get some wins to help us too. 


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Thunder (43-29) 132

Raptors (52-18) 125

Thunder stay ahead of the Pelicans, which is very good for us, need to count on them and the Trail Blazers to at least keep them away from the top

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Celtics (47-22) 89

Pelicans(39-30) 108

Celtics just can't deal with the Pelicans with all their injuries, Pelicans manage to tie up the large group of teams ahead of them. Today is their day off before three games in a row so we need them to lose at least couple of those.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Rockets(55-14) 129

Wolves (40-30) 120

Wolves can't manage to take the Rockets, fall down to 8th seed in the playoffs behind the Pelicans

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Blazers (43-26) 122

Clippers(37-31) 109

Not all bad with the Blazers staying far ahead of the Pelicans, but the Clippers fall a little further back to 2.5 games behind the Pelicans.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Bucks (37-32) vs Cavaliers (40-29)

Spread: Cavaliers -2.5

Cavaliers can stay ahead of the Pelicans to benefit us where the Bucks don't really affect us at all.

**Go Cavaliers!**

&nbsp;

Lakers (31-38) vs Pacers (40-30)

Spread: Pacers -4.5

Pacers are tied with the Pelicans now and need to stay ahead of them if the Pelicans are going to make the playoffs. Tough game though, Lakers are hot.

**Go Pacers!**

&nbsp;

Hornets (30-40) vs 76ers (38-30) 

Spread: 76ers -8.5

76ers are just 1 game back of the Pelicans and can help us there, should be a win for them Hornets haven't played well lately.

**Go 76ers!**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (19-50) vs Nets (22-48)

Spread: Nets -6.5

Grizzlies really need to help us out by going back to losing tonight. It's what they want too so please Grizzlies just get the Nets a win here. Nets would be 2 games ahead of us if they win.

**Go Nets!**

&nbsp;

Nuggets (38-32) vs Heat (37-33)

Spread: Heat -1.5

Nuggets have the best record for a non playoff team in the West, so they are the ones we need to kick the Pelicans out of the playoffs.

**Go Nuggets!**

&nbsp;

Bulls (24-45) vs Knicks (25-45)

Spread: Knicks -5.0

This one is huge. To catch any of the other teams we need them to win, but with the Knicks we control our own destiny. Losing this gives us 1.5 games of cushion, but winning would put us right back in the 9th lottery spot.

This is the perfect storm for this game with Dunn, Lavine, and Markkanen being out for tonight. Valentine went off yesterday, and that was awesome but hopefully any player that gets hot tonight doesn't win us the game. 

**Go Knicks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

Warriors (53-17) vs Spurs (40-30)

Spread: Spurs -7.5

Spurs catch the Warriors at the right time with all their injuries, need to keep winning to stay ahead of the Pelicans in the West.

**Go Spurs!**

&nbsp;

Pistons (30-39) vs Kings (23-48)

Spread: Pistons -3.5

Kings have been hot lately and have a winnable game in this one. Pistons are really inconsistent, if they have a down game Kings could start the winning streak we need them to have.

**Go Kings!**

"Yesterday was just what the Bulls needed for both of our picks. We lost, two teams we were chasing won, Pelicans lost, several teams that are competing with the Pelicans won. Knicks upset was especially nice because we have the control of the 8th pick back. 

Today there's only 4 games, (and as I write this one is already almost over). No tanks play today, but each game has an opportunity to improve the Pelicans pick, especially the Pelicans game against the Celtics later.


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&amp;nbsp;

Hawks(20-49) 117

Bucks (36-32) 122

Hawks were already pretty far ahead of us and we probably won't pass them unless they upset multiple playoff teams over their last dozen or so games. 

**Bad for tank**

&amp;nbsp;

Pacers (40-29) 102

Wizards(39-30) 109

Wizards tie up the Pacers in the East, and more importantly both teams are now ahead of the Pelicans in case they make the playoffs.

**Neutral for Pelicans pick**

&amp;nbsp;

Rockets (54-14) 107

Pelicans (39-29) 101

Pelicans lose the first of their back-to-back* (and Tuesday they start a back-to-back-to-back). They fall all the way down to sole possession of the 18th pick, a huge improvement from the mid 20's pick they had recently. They likely get a few more losses on this tough stretch of games, hopefully they can fall all the way to 13th if the Nuggets and Clippers can pass them.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&amp;nbsp;

Mavs(22-47) 106

Nets (21-48) 114

Both teams are teams we can still realistically pass so this was good either way. Nets we still play twice so it's good to be back closer to them. Mavericks are still a manageable 2.5 games back, and they play the Pelicans next so we need them to have a really good game there to help us out twice.

**Neutral for tank**

&amp;nbsp;

Hornets(30-39) 101

Knicks (24-45) 124

Huge win for the Knicks to put the Bulls back in the 8th spot for now. It's great to see them play such a good game when they have been pretty bad for a while. We only lead them by 0.5 games so the Knicks need some more wins to get some cushion there. Great opportunity for that when they play us next

**Good for tank**

&amp;nbsp;

Cavs (39-29) 114

Bulls (24-44) 109

Wow what a game by Valentine. With almost all of our best players sitting out injured, I don't think anyone saw Valentine going toe to toe with Lebron to get us so close to winning. It was really great to see him ball out and yet we also still get the much needed loss. 

This loss puts us back in front of the Knicks but we need loss in our next game to keep that 8th spot. With so many players out of the lineup, theres great opportunity to move up if the Kings can keep up their good play or if the Nets or Mavs can string some wins together.

**Good for tank**

&amp;nbsp;

Nuggets (38-31) 

Grizzlies (18-50)

Grizzlies end their losing streak one game too late. I didn't see the game but judging from the stats it was mostly a product of the Nuggets just shooting really bad all game. The Bulls don't catch the Grizzlies unless they turn this into a big streak, so this game just hurts our chances of the Nuggets catching the Pelicans.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&amp;nbsp;

Wolves(40-29) 101

Spurs (39-30) 117

Spurs pass the Pelicans, and hopefully its for good this time. Both of these teams have been inconsistent lately and we need them to keep winning to stay ahead of the Pelicans because now their just 0.5 games up.

**Neutral for Pelicans pick**

&amp;nbsp;

Kings(23-47) 97

Jazz (39-30) 103

Kings continue their good play recently by keeping up with one of the hottest teams in the league for the whole game. They had a back and forth 4th quarter until the Jazz secured the game late. Kings are very possible to tie us if they can just pull of a few more wins down the stretch. Jazz pass the Pelicans with this game too so there's a positive for that too.

**Bad for tank, Good for Pelicans pick**

&amp;nbsp;

Warriors(52-17) 124

Suns (19-51) 109

Suns don't affect us anymore and Warriors never did, so this game didn't really matter to us.

**No effect on tank**

&amp;nbsp;

Pistons (30-38) 87

Blazers (42-26) 100

Trail Blazers are now four games ahead of the Pelicans and probably won't be passed unless they start a losing streak. 

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&amp;nbsp;

Hawks (20-49) vs Bucks (36-32)

Spread: Bucks -11.0

No real chance the Bulls can still catch the Hawks but the Bucks don't really affect us either so root for the unlikely chance of a 3+ game Hawks winning streak.

**Go Hawks!**

&amp;nbsp;

Thunder (43-29) 132

Raptors (52-18) 125

This game just finished as I was writing this so good win by the Thunder. This puts them ahead of the Pelicans by 2.5 games now, which could be extended to 3 games if the Pelicans can lose their game later.

**Go Thunder! (Good for Pelicans pick)**

&amp;nbsp;

Celtics (47-22) vs Pelicans (39-30) 

Spread: Pelicans -1.5

Celtics still dealing with several injuries but have played pretty well through it. Pelicans just played last night and also play 3 games in a row starting Tuesday* so it'll be a tough one for them too. The Pelicans may have the 18th pick, but they are also just 0.5 games back of 5 different teams, meaning they could easily have a mid 20's pick back if they win enough. Every game is crucial for them now so we need them to lose now more than ever.

**Go Celtics!**

&amp;nbsp;

Rockets (55-14) vs Timberwolves (40-30)

Spread: Rockets -7.0

Both teams just played last night so no advantage for either team there. Timberwolves are one of the five teams that are 0.5 games ahead of the Pelicans, so a win here is crucial to stay ahead of them. 

**Go Timberwolves!**

&amp;nbsp;

Trail Blazers (43-26) vs Clippers (37-31)

Spread: Clippers -2.0

I feel good enough about the Trail Blazers being 4 games ahead of the Pelicans, so a win for the Clippers would be much better here. They are 1.5 games behind the Pelicans and can knock them out of the playoffs if they can pass them up. 

**Go Clippers!**

"I know the overwhelming consensus is Mikal is the better Bridges, but how do you guys feel about Miles? I personally have held a bias against him but did a little bit more in depth research on him last night and I’m starting to come around to him. 

Major positives: dude is next level explosive and strong for a small forward. He’s shooting a solid percentage from three, nearly 90 percent from the line, can finish strong through contact with either hand. 

Weaknesses: his weakness seems to solely come from his lack of elite wingspan. He doesn’t have the upside defensively that Mikal has and he can have a tough time finishing on offense over length because of it. 

What are your thoughts on him as a prospect and how would you feel if the Bulls landed him?

"Happy St. Patrick's Day! Yesterday we got really close to an amazing day, but had to settle for a decent one. Nets and Mavericks got really really close to some huge upsets, but ended up losing their late leads. Kings were able to hold on to theirs though to beat the Warriors. 

Today there are 11 games playing, with almost all of them impacting our draft picks in a big way. We play a struggling Cavs team we need a win against. Knicks have a winnable game against the Hornets. Mavs play the Nets so we gain a crucial game there as long as we lose. Also the Pelicans start their streak of 5 games in 6 days today against the Rockets, and a lot of other teams chasing the Pels play today.


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Celtics(46-22) 92

Magic (21-48) 83

Magic are pretty much out of reach for the Bulls unless they pull a crazy winning streak for the last few weeks.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Nets (21-47) 116

76ers(37-30) 120

Nets had a few late leads that they couldn't hold and end up losing again. They played well though, they need to keep playing consistently good if we're going to pass them

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Mavericks(22-46) 115

Raptors (51-17) 122

Mavericks took one of the best teams in the league to OT, and really should have won it. Mavs lead the ENTIRE SECOND HALF until the Raptors tied it to go to overtime, and then the Mavericks took an early overtime lead. They managed to throw it all away though and took a loss. 

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Clippers (37-30) 113

Thunder (41-29) 121

Clippers keep looking like they will take the playoff spot and run with it, but can never hold it for too long. They fall back a little further from the Pelicans, but the Thunder take a bigger lead on the Pelicans so thats good.

**Neutral for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Kings (22-47) 

Warriors(52-16)

Spread: Warriors -8.5

Warriors were injured as hell but the Kings still get a huge upset to win this one. If they keep up this good play they might be the most likely team for us to pass.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Heat (36-33) 92

Lakers(31-37) 91

Doesn't really affect us one way or the other.

**No effect on either pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Hawks (20-49) vs Bucks (36-32)

Spread: Bucks -11.0

No real chance the Bulls can still catch the Hawks but the Bucks don't really affect us either so root for the unlikely chance of a 3+ game Hawks winning streak.

**Go Hawks!**

&nbsp;

Pacers (40-29) vs Wizards (39-30)

Spread: No line yet

Wizards are 0.5 games behind the Pelicans, Pacers are 0.5 games ahead of them. Either way if the Pelicans are in the playoffs we want both teams ahead of them so pick whoever you want in this one.

**Toss up, take your pick**

&nbsp;

Rockets (54-14) vs Pelicans (39-29) 

Spread: Rockets -7.0

Nice tough matchup to start the hard part of the schedule for the Pelicans. A loss for them here would be a great start to what is hopefully 3-4 losses in a week.

**Go Rockets!**

&nbsp;

Mavericks (22-47) vs Nets (21-48)

Spread: Nets -1.0

Whoever you think the Bulls have a better chance of passing is who you should be rooting for in this one. Mavericks are a full game closer to us, but the Nets are not actively tanking and we also have 2 more games against them. I'm honestly pretty split here, but I think I'll root Mavs with them being a little closer. Feel free to root either way though.

**Toss up, take your pick**

&nbsp;

Hornets (30-39) vs Knicks (24-45)

Spread: Hornets -6.5

Winnable game for the Knicks, but they are really bad lately so it'll be tough. We really desperately need a few wins out of them so we can at least get the 8th spot back.

**Go Knicks!**

&nbsp;

Cavaliers (39-29) vs Bulls (24-44)

Spread: No line yet

I haven't seen the official report yet  (writing this yesterday and won't be able to update things today) but the last I saw the Bulls are going to be without a lot of our good players for this game, and next game too if I had to guess. If we actually lose out, we're probably in pretty good position, but we've shown that even without some players we're too good for that. A loss here would at least gain a game on the Mavs or Nets though so that's good.

**Go Cavaliers!**

&nbsp;

Nuggets (38-31) vs Grizzlies (18-50)

Spread: No line yet

Grizzlies being horrible can finally help us here. Nuggets are the closest team that is out of the playoffs that can pass the Pelicans. Just 1.5 games back and they could easily be just 0.5 games back at the end of the night.

**Go Nuggets!**

&nbsp;

Timberwolves (40-29) vs Spurs (39-30)

Spread: Spurs -4.0

Battle of the two teams that game away their playoff security by being bad for a while. Take your pick with this one, Spurs are 0.5 games behind the Pelicans and the Wolves are 0.5 games ahead. Either way this game goes, both teams need to play well after it so they can stay in the playoffs and kick the Pelicans out.

**Toss up, take your pick**

&nbsp;

Kings (23-47) vs Jazz (39-30)

Spread: Jazz -1.0

I'm not seeing any reason in the game preview why the spread is so low in this one. Vegas must really like the Kings in this one, which is good for us. Kings are 5-4 in their last 9, and look good enough for us to pass them (2 games back) if we can just manage to play bad enough. Jazz win would be good too though with them just 0.5 back of the Pelicans.

**Go Kings!**

&nbsp;

Warriors (52-17) vs Suns (19-51)

Spread: No line yet

No way we catch the Suns unless they win like 10 of their last 12, so unless you're an even bigger optimist than me, this game has no effect on us.

**Take your pick, neither team affects us**

&nbsp;

Pistons (30-38) vs Trail Blazers (42-26)

Spread: Trail Blazers -8.5

Trail Blazers are on an 11 game winning streak that most likely continues tonight. They are now 3 games ahead of the Pelicans, so I don't see the Pelicans catching them anymore, but some more insurance is always nice when the other team is just the Pistons.

**Go Trail Blazers!**

Grizzlies(18-49) 110

We played a pretty bad game and gave the Grizzlies every chance to win it. When Blakely pulled up for the 3 I really thought we had lost it, but they fouled him to give us just enough to win the game. 

With this loss we pretty much give up on catching the Hawks and Magic, if you didn't give up on that already. To catch the Mavs, Nets, or Kings, we're going to have to pretty much lose out, maybe one more win max. Realistically, getting back into the 8 spot would be a blessing at this point with how bad the Knicks are playing. We have a lot of players out now with injuries so We'll have to see the next couple games go with us and the other tanks and then reevaluate how realistic it is that we pick anywhere earlier than 8th.

**Bad for tank**

Pelicans(39-28) 93

Spurs (38-30) 98

Spurs manage to shut the Pels down to 35 points in the second half, get a really huge win for that second pick of ours.

**Go Magic!**

&nbsp;

**Go Mavericks!**

&nbsp;

Clippers (37-30) vs Thunder (41-29)

Spread: Thunder -5.0

Clippers are still 1.5 games back of the Pelicans, and Thunder are 1 games ahead of the Pelicans. I usually root for the closer team, but I see the Pelicans losing a few more games over their tough stretch, so I'm going to root for the Clippers to win and close the gap. Thunder win is good too though, always nice to have a cushion for the teams ahead of the Pelicans.

**Go Clippers!**

&nbsp;

Kings (22-47) vs Warriors (52-16)

Spread: Warriors -8.5

Once again, Warriors have a lot of players out but that spread still seems really low for this game. If there was ever a game for the Kings to beat the Warriors though, it would be this game. A loss puts the Kings 3 games ahead of us and not very realistic, but a win puts them only 2 games ahead of us and a much better possibility.

**Go Kings!**

&nbsp;

Heat (36-33) vs Lakers (31-37)

Spread: Lakers -3.0

Neither team really affects us, the Lakers are far away from both pick and the Heat don't matter because if they ever pass the Pelicans the Pels are out of the playoffs already. Take your pick, but the Lakers play the Pelicans soon so some momentum would be good for them.

"There has been a lot of posts recently looking optimistically at the Bulls and that's flat out wrong. Let's take this point by point shall we?


1. We won.


This is not a good thing, let's all get that straight. We played the worst team in the league, on a losing streak to rival the Browns. And we barely won. There is no silver lining here. The point of this season from the very start, and basically said outright after the all-star break, is to tank. Tanking means LOSING so we can't even do follow our own plan correctly. 


2. But, we won so that shows how we aren't horrible.


Wrong again. We beat the absolute worst team. A team that is actively trying to lose (better than us). That's not an accomplishment by any stretch of the imagination. We are an NBA team playing against basically a good G-league team. Our collection of talent and coaching is not up to snuff with even middle of the pack teams, but hey, look at us we beat freaking memphis. 


3. But we win so that builds our character/team for the future.


Nope. Not in our case. If you want a statement win, go beat the Warriors, Rockets, Celtics, etc.. That might be an accomplishment you can build off, not other tanks. I concede we had one of these earlier, the TWolves. that was good for morale, a good FU to our ex-coach and Jimmy. But that's about it. Beating Memphis and other meddling shit teams gives us nothing to build off of. If you want to be the best, you have to beat the best. We frankly don't belong in the same league as the best teams these days.


3a. But our young guys played well (this isn't specific to any game, just the general sentiment)


That means nothing, against shit competition. Again, play well against good players and you can consider that progress. Playing okay (sure better than they played earlier this year, but not good by any comparison to truly good players) shouldn't give this fan base confidence.


4. We have a core of players, we will do well going forward.


Sorry guys, and I get why I'll be disliked for saying this, but we don't. Here's a rundown of actually useful players we have:


Lauri - hopefully a future all star. Hopefully.

Dunn - ceiling would be 6th man of the year, similar to Taj Gibson a few years back. Certainly useful, but not someone you build your team around.

Lavine - A useful 3rd piece on a championship team, ceiling is Kevin Love. He's frankly not good enough since his ACL to build a team around him. He is the guy you bring in when you have 2 established stars as a 3rd option. 

Nwaba - Ceiling is a poor man's Taj. Basically 2nd guy coming off the bench on a good team. Again, not a piece you can build around.


Everyone else can be replaced off of the scrap pile every year. This is not a winning combination.


5. GarPax is doing well!


They have been as shitty as ever. They can't tank. They traded Niko for shit and basically had to take a bad contract just to get a pick out of it. (Sorry Asik, your days are done though). These decision makes picked up a shit coach that nobody wanted and are sticking by him. Why?

""oh look how our young guys are developing"" WHAT? Developing where? We have barely 20 wins this year! That's not development, that's shit. We can BARELY beat teams that are trying as hard as they can to lose. Nobody has gotten dramatically better, there's no system to buy into. Nobody will ever want to come to CHI for basketball until we get new management, a new coach, and actually good players.


6. Tanking is bad and you should always try to win!


I actually typically agree with this point. But you have to look at the bigger picture sometimes. We're out of the playoffs, and based on the players we have are going nowhere fast. I'm not saying we should tank from the start of a season, we have to see what happens right? But after a 3-20 start, it was time to tank. 


We need an infusion of talent and (see point 5) will have no FA coming to Chicago. The only way to get better is draft. Maybe the lottery will get rigged for us, but I'm not counting on that.


TL;DR - bring back the Fire GarPax billboards. Fire Hoiberg. Brace for the 2003 bulls for the next 5 -10 years.


PS. I actually love the bulls, they have been my favorite team (of all sports) since my pre-teen years. I will be here for the highs and the lows, but it's time for people to stop burying their heads in the sand.

"I'll be 24 in less than a month, so I was 4 when the Bulls won their last title. I remember none of the Jordan Era. The best incarnation of the Bulls that I've seen is when they lost the ECF to the Heat. Then Rose tore his ACL and it's been slowly downhull from there. I don't care where they're drafting, or who they draft, Pax and Gar know a hell of alot more about basketball than I ever will.

"rather bored at breakfast, I decided to do a comprehensive breakdown of the schedules remaining for all of the treats in the tank race. when my comprehension skills fell just short of comprehensible, I decided to go with my gut feelings instead. Here we go

**Chicago Bulls** 
(23-44) Tank Matchups 4
Best Case: we need to lose, and im talking everything. best case scenario we lose out, handing devastating wins to the Knicks, Magic and 2 to the Nets down the stretch. The biggest challenge to this result is out game tonight against the Grizzlies, which is also the only one we can really afford to win and still move up to the 3rd spot. Final Result (23-59)

Likely:
We Likely beat the Grizzlies and split the series with the nets. i threw in an extra win against the magic because who are we kidding, we're probably going to blow it. Final Result (26-56)

**Dallas Mavericks**
(22-46) Tank Matchups: 4
Best Case: they win out... barring that miracle, Maverick wins against the Nets, Kings, Lakers and Magic are the best chance to catch them. with a season-ending win against the suns, we get out Final Result (27-55)

Likely: they probably won't beat the Lakers, and lose one more of their 4 Tank Matchups, leaving them with a likely record of (24-58)

**Sacremento Kings** 
(22-47) Tank Matchups 4
Best Case: similar to the Mavs, they need key wins against the Lakers and some other tank teams. if they can beat the suns (were never gonna catch them) Griz (same deal) and an upset of the pacers they can hopefully get right where we want them at (26-56)

Likely: they will probably beat the suns, which in this case would be a bad thing for our overall standings but good for the bulls passing the kings. Trade that win for a probable loss to pacers and lakers and they will likely end up (25-57)

**Brooklyn (Cavs)** 
(21-47) Tank Matchups 5

Best Case: sweeping the bulls at the end of their season would go a long way to helping the Bulls and fucking the Cavs, both positives in my book. in their best case scenario, I have them winning 3 of their 5 tank matchups, needing losses to the magic (will explain) and the Mavericks. with an extra win against the heat or hornets, they can end up (25-57).

Likely: still not the worst scenario, but if they split the Bulls series, and don't get that hornets/heat win, I can see a (24-58) season putting us tied at the end.

**Orlando Magic**
(21-48) Tank Matchup 6
Best Case: this tank season hinges on a 6 game stretch by Orlando. the Magic play the suns, nets, bulls, hawks, knicks and mavericks in a row and in that order. if they can come out of that stretch with wins over only the Knicks and Mavericks, it would put the bulls in a great position to pass them up. their only other chance of squeezing a win in is against the Hornets immediately after that 6 game stretch. but no matter what, they must beat the bulls. (25-57)
Likely: they only win 3 of the 4 and lose to the bulls, ending at (24-58)

**Atlanta Hawks**
Best Case: wow they do not have an easy schedule. if they can somehow beat the Hornets, bucks kings and heat than maybe we can squeeze by if they rise to (25-60)
Likely: they maybe win one against the kings, but I doubt it, they will probably lose out (20-62)

**Suns and Grizzlies**
except for the Grizzlies game tonight, we need these teams to lose out. we have no real chance of catching them and need them to suck bad against the other tanks. 

**conclusion**: we will fall somewhere between 3-9, and its a tough ride to the finish. i will upload the spreadsheet later, for now, i have to get back to work. 

Edit: T**he New York Knickerbockers** 
(24-44) Tank Matchup 2
Best Case:
oh boy did I forget a big scary monster looming on the horizon? the Knicks have lost 8 games in a row leading into tonight's matchup against the 76ers. They are only half a game behind us for the 8th pick and tanking fast. Without their unicorn, they've turned into donkeys. They suck, really bad, and it is going to take a pivotal game against them to get them off of our backs. The best case scenario they win games against the Bulls, Hornets, and Magic down the stretch (worst case they lose to us and we're essentially fucked). a finishing record of (27-55) is all we can realistically ask for.
Likely: they win at least one of their only two tank games and lose out the rest. in my scenario I have them losing two and ending (26-56) but it may just be wishful thinking.

"A perfect day for the tank yesterday! Yes there were only four games and only three that even affected us, but it was pretty sweet that it all went our way. We gained a little on the Kings and Magic, and the Wizards are closer to passing the Pelicans.

All of that won't mean too much though if we don't pull a big loss today against the worst team in the NBA. We have won too many of our games against other tanks lately, which has made it very hard to move back up. Other than our game and the Knicks game, not too many other games today affect our draft pick. But the Pelicans play today along with five other teams within 2 games of them, so a lot could happen with that pick.


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Bucks (36-31) 117

Magic (20-48) 126

I was getting ready to completely give up on catching the Magic but they pulled a nice upset yesterday. They lead for practically the entire game and shot 52% from 3. If the Bulls managed to get a loss today, we would be 2.5 games back of the Magic, which is possible if we lose enough. 

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Wizards(38-30) 125

Celtics (46-21) 124

Celtics were missing a bunch of players and the Wizards managed to finally take the game in double OT. That puts them 1 game behind the Pelicans, which is important if the Pelicans end up staying in the playoffs.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Heat (36-32) 119

Kings(21-47) 123

Kings did their best to lose, throwing away their 16 point 4th quarter lead. In the end though, Fox made a shot at the buzzer to force OT and the Kings managed to outplay the Heat in extra time to win it. Fox, Randolph, and Hield all played well scoring 20+ points and each hitting some clutch shots. Kings are now 2 games ahead of the Bulls, but we have some games in hand that we could use to shrink the deficit even more.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Lakers (31-36) 106

Warriors(51-16) 117

This one doesn't have any affect on the Bulls, but the Lakers have been doing the opposite of whatever is good for us so the petty side of me was happy they lost here. The Lakers play the Pelicans soon though, so let's hope they can win that one for us.

**No effect on either pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Raptors (50-17) vs Pacers (40-28)

Spread: Raptors -3.5

Pacers are ahead of the Pelicans by 0.5 games, and it's best for us if they stay ahead in case of Pelicans making the playoffs. They're playing very well lately, but it'll be tough agains the Raptors who have won 9 straight.

**Go Pacers!**

&nbsp;

Hornets (29-39) vs Hawks (20-48)

Spread: Hornets -4.5

Hawks have lost a lot lately but the Hornets aren't too hot either. It's a slim chance that we pass the Hawks in the lottery standing, but it's still possible. A win here with a Bulls loss would put them 2.5 games ahead of us but we'd also have a game in hand.

**Go Hawks!**

&nbsp;

76ers (36-30) vs Knicks (24-44) 

Spread: 76ers -9.0

Knicks are just really bad and don't look like they are going to make anything easy on us the rest of the way. They probably lose this along with a lot more of their games coming up. 

**Go Knicks!**

&nbsp;

Clippers (37-29) vs Rockets (53-14)

Spread: Rockets -11.5

Clippers are still clinging to the edge of the playoffs but will have a tough time staying in tonight against the Rockets. They are 1.5 games behind the Pelicans, so an upset here would help the Clippers a lot to pass them.

**Go Clippers!**

&nbsp;

Bulls (23-44) vs Grizzlies (18-49)

Spread: Grizzlies -2.0

The Grizzlies have just been really really terrible since the break, but they have to have one decent game eventually just by chance right? I've pretty much given up hope on catching the Grizzlies (currently at 5 games back) so the game we gain there doesn't mean much. We can get just 1 game behind the Mavericks, 1.5 games behind the Kings, and 2 games behind the Nets with a loss today. 

I didn't see anything specific in the preview for the game, but I'm assuming Lauri is still out based on the spread. We're gonna need some pretty bad games from at least a few players tonight, along with a Grizzly player or two to go off. I swear if the Grizzlies can beat us tonight I will root for them to win the lottery race.

**Go Grizzlies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

Pelicans (39-28) vs Spurs (38-30)

Spread: Spurs -3.5

Big game here with the Spurs out of the playoffs but only 1.5 games behind the Pelicans. Kawhi was rumored to be coming back for this one but that's not happening anymore, so the Spurs will have to win with what they got. Pelicans have not looked as good since their winning streak ended. This is good timing for us, because after this game the hardest part of the Pelicans schedule starts on Saturday with 5 games in 6 days. Pelicans are really close to falling out of the playoffs so this next week for them could help our draft pick a lot.

**Go Spurs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

Pistons (30-37) vs Nuggets (37-31) 

Spread: Nuggets -7.5

Nuggets have been cold lately but are still close enough to make the playoffs. 2.5 games behind the Pelicans now.

**Go Nuggets!**

&nbsp;

Suns (19-50) vs Jazz (38-30)

Spread: Jazz -12.5

Just like the Grizzlies I've given up on catching the Suns, so the Jazz are the team we want in this one. Jazz are another team right on the edge in the West, and 1.5 games behind the Pelicans. They can move up even further with an easy game here. I swear if the Suns manage to win this game, after rooting for them to win for so long and now finally rooting for them to lose, they become my least favorite team this year.

**Go Jazz!**

&nbsp;

Cavaliers (39-28) vs Trail Blazers (41-26)

Spread: Trail Blazers -5.0

Trail Blazers are hot and 2 games ahead of the Pelicans in the West. making that gap wider would be best for us, don't want the Pelicans to go on another roll. Cavs win isn't terrible either though with them still tied in record with the Pelicans.

**Go Trail Blazers!**

11 games against tough playoff teams. The two games against Rockets and that one at Golden State, are most likely games they're gonna lose. Let's say they win 6 out of 11 of those games. Losing both against Spurs, losing both games against Rockets and losing against GSW, then they will end up 49-33. I say that's good for 5th-6th in the west. But if they lose against Celtics and Cavs, they'll end up 47-35. Would that put them 7th-8th in the west? If they lose nine games out of those eleven, then I say they will be out of the playoffs. Best case scenario for us would be them losing at least 10 of those tough games. But isn't likely to happen...

"Pretty much every game went our way yesterday, except for the Pelicans game (and they were favored anyways), Nets game (and they were never gonna beat the Raptors), and Nuggets game (Lakers hate us). We gained a game on the Mavericks and all the other teams kept pace with the Pelicans.

Today there's not much going on for us. Out of the four games, there's only two tanks playing and no playoff teams from the west. Focus all your energy into rooting for the Kings win, as long as you've gotten used to the probable disappointment by now.

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Bucks (36-31) vs Magic (20-48)

Spread: Bucks -9.0

This one is tough because the Bucks have a better shot of catching the Pelicans than the Bulls have of catching the Magic. But if the Pelicans lose enough to be caught by the Bucks, they are probably out of the playoffs and then the Bucks record wouldn't matter. If the Magic won this they would still be 3 games ahead, but only 2 wins less than us.

**Go Magic!**

&nbsp;

Wizards (38-30) vs Celtics (46-21)

Spread: Wizards -3.5

Wizards are 1.5 games behind the Pelicans, could definitely pass them if they play well. 

**Go Wizards!**

&nbsp;

Heat (36-32) vs Kings (21-47) 

Spread: Heat -7.0

Kings loss here would put them 2 games ahead of us, we need them to get a few wins so they don't get too far out of reach.

**Go Kings!**

&nbsp;

Lakers (31-36) vs Warriors (51-16)

Spread: Warriors -7.5

I'm mad at the Lakers for beating a bunch of tanks and West playoff teams lately so I'm rooting for the Warriors, but either result has nothing to do with us so take your pick.

**No effect on either pick**

"I was running a few lottery/draft sims on Tankathon a few nights ago when I ran into something similar to [this outcome](https://i.imgur.com/RBaBlyq.png). It got me thinking- would I want the Bulls to take Doncic? My initial reaction is that we don't need another SG in the starting lineup, and anyone who gets drafted early would ideally grow into a starter. With us already having Dunn and LaVine as starter guards Doncic wouldn't fit. 

But until recently, Luka Doncic was the consensus #1 pick. Ayton has probably passed him now, but you still hear that Doncic is a generational talent that would be absolutely insane to pass up on if you had the chance. He's honestly supposed to be that good. 

What would you do? 

- I see drafting Porter at 2 as a reasonable move due to our SF needs, but that's the type of move that our front office would get absolutely crucified for if it didn't pan out. I know that nothing is ever sure, but I see Doncic regarded as more of a sure-thing than Porter in draft reviews quite often.

- We could draft Doncic anyway and try to find a way to make it work, maybe see if he can play SF. If he can't we could turn him or LaVine into a top-tier 6th man SG a-la Lou Williams, but this leaves us with a hole at SF still.

- Yet another possibility is doing the inverse of what the Bears did last year. They traded a bunch of assets to move up from #3 to #2 to draft our quarterback of the future, because the #2 team had competitive offers from other teams that may have taken him from us. Similarly we could field offers for the #2 pick, but this would really only work if the #3 team would be sure to draft Doncic. Plus, there just aren't as many assets to trade in the NBA as there are in the NFL.

So what do ya think? Obviously this is a low-chance hypothetical and we're far more likely to draft Wendell Carter or Mikal Bridges with pick 8/9/10. Still fun to dream about the lottery being in our favor, though!","DRAFT SCENARIO: We get the #2 pick in the lottery! The #1 team selects DeAndre Ayton. What do you do?

With our win against the Hawks yesterday is hard to see the Bulls pick moving more than 1 spot up or back at this point. The opportunity was there to move up further, but its hard to out tank 7 other teams when you win 3 of your last 5. On the bright side, the Pelicans lost and almost all the teams close to them won, so that pick is improving a bit. 

Not too much happening today, but a few West playoffs teams could win, and the Kings could bail us out a bit with a win today too.

Hawks actually played pretty well, we just had a good game at the wrong time.

We're 0.5 games ahead of the Knicks now, and we are 2.5 games back of the Nets, Kings, and Mavs. Ideally maybe one of those teams can play better than us and we catch them, but even that doesn't look too likely right now.

"#**PREFACE:** 

*This is based off of a 10-game sample size, and may of course be a product of that. That said, we're going to dive into each corner of his game and how it relates to years past for our main man the Tank Commander.*

#**Part 1: SCORING and SHOOTING**

The general stats:

-|PPG|PTS per 36min|PTS per 100poss|USG%|TS%|FTrate|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Career Average|5.3|14.0|19.2|20.5|46.6%|0.069|
Career Best|5.3|14.6|20.1|20.9|49.0%|**0.086**|
2017-2018|**7.9**|**15.6**|**21.2**|20.3|**53.6%**|0.078|

The biggest reason for his spike in scoring is, of course, his shot selection and percentages. The single most important thing, to me, is his conversion at the rim. **He is finishing a career-high 64.3% from 0-3 feet, clobbering his career average of 45.5%.** While his FT rate has not changed, the quantity of shots at the rim and his conversion makes his drive game quite a bit more potent as an offensive option. He is now finishing at a rate similar to an actual NBA point guard which is opening up the offense tremendously.

He is also starting to realize his potential as a shooter from deep, and the superior tension in his legs for his jumpshot is, uh, well-documented on this sub. Blankly put, he has range, and **he's averaging a significant career high percentage from deep at 34.6%**. This is still below NBA average by two points, but it's a comfortable 2.5% improvement from last season. With Hoiberg's patterns of success in tinkering with jumpshots, this is probably not a fluke.

He has also eliminated the midrange jumper from his game entirely, with the 10-16 feet range making up **2% of all of his FGAs, down from his usual 14-16%.** Cam has instead opted to go to the hole nearly twice as much, a frequency of **27.5% of all of his FGAs, up from his usual 12-14%.** Point blank, he's taking better looks, and he's converting more because of it.

#**Part 2: DISTRIBUTION and RUNNING THE OFFENSE**

Cam's aforementioned improved driving game is opening up Hoiball, too. He is a plus-minus GOD this season, **averaging a on/off rating of fucking +14.4**. While this could be somewhat attributed to the energy of the bench unit (and honestly disappointing performances from the starters as of late), Cam is providing value on his own as a point man initiating the offense.

Here are some distribution statistics:

-|AST%|ASS per 100poss|TOV%|TOV per 100poss|3P% off of passes from Cam|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Career Average|21.3%|7.1|13.1%|3.1|N/A|
Career Best|22.5%|7.7|12.9%|3.0|N/A|
2017-2018|**26.4%**|**8.1**|13.1%|3.1|37.0%|

In a broad sense, Cam is passing at a higher rate, with more passes leading to assists than before, while maintaining the same number of turnovers (which was already fairly low to begin with). This is obviously a good thing, since [he's only averaging 4 seconds per touch of the ball, comparable to TJ McConnell, Terry Rozier, and Vic Oladipo](https://stats.nba.com/players/touches/?sort=AVG_SEC_PER_TOUCH&dir=1). He's making things happen and *quickly*, which is a pretty fundamental Hoiball tenet. Our main man Kris is averaging a slightly more annoying 4.55 seconds per touch, but he's in good company too (Ben Simmons, Ricky Rubio, Mike Conley, CJ McCollum, etc.).

That last stat is a brand new one now provided by NBA.com, on the [Passing Dashboard under the Advanced Stats Tracking tab](https://stats.nba.com/player/1626166/passes-dash/), and as such we don't have his stats from previous years. The important part of it is that **the Bulls normally shoot 35.8% from three, so Cam's distribution leading to 37.0% to better-than-average shots being taken (even if by an insignificant amount)**.

As for the offensive aggregate stats, well... they sort of speak for themselves:

-|ORtg|OWS/48|OBPM|ORPM|VORP|Plus-Minus per 100poss|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Career Average|98|-0.038|-1.8|-2.5|-0.3|-8.4|
Career Best|104|**0.040**|-0.4|**-0.86**|-0.86|0.1|-10.6|
2017-2018|**107**|0.0341|**0.5**|-1.57|0.1|***FUCKING +14.4***|

It's important to note that ORtg, OBPM, and ORPM are extremely team-oriented, and [the Bulls have an absolutely horrendous offense, sitting at 27th in the NBA this season](http://www.espn.com/nba/hollinger/teamstats/_/order/true). So it's important to note that even though he is not completely career-highs here, he was playing with MVP Westbrook last season and both Russ and KD the year prior. Those OKC teams averaged a 107.5 Offensive Efficiency while he was there, good for a tie for #9 with Indiana if inserted into this season. The general point is that being a bit behind is still promising, seeing as how his improved game is still being represented despite him being on a terrible team.

That said, his impact is pretty obvious. **His ORtg is a full 6 points better than the team's average output**, and his on/off is absolutely fucking ridiculous. He just makes the offense move with pace, which is backed up by the eye test - he's always looking upstream in transition and making passes off of drives. He's been more patient but also more aggressive and that's a huge recipe for success.

Another minor, but potentially correlative stat is that this is the first season he's been used exclusively as lead guard during his time on the court, **helming 100% of all PG duties during his minutes per Basketball Reference**. It's clear that despite his deficiencies last season, he is still much more valuable as the clear floor general during his 18 minutes with the bench units.

#**Part 3: DEFENSIVE PRESSURE**

Via the [NBA.com Defense Dashboard](https://stats.nba.com/player/1626166/defense-dash/), Cam is swarming his assignments. They are averaging a whopping **17.1% worse shooting from 3P territory when guarded by Cam Payne**, and he contests nearly 4 a game which is not an insignificant sample size. He is 6'3"" with a 6'7"" wingspan and fairly strong lateral quickness so it's nice to see him actually using it.

The success ends pretty shortly after that, with him **allowing his opponents to shoot 8.2% better on 2-point range.** From my very basic eye test analysis, this is from a lot of letting guys run right by him and gambling often. However, I think with his prowess in defending the 3-point shot, the prospect of swarming the perimeter and gambling on the drive is a not-terrible one because at best they usually end with a long 2. He is also actually backing it up and stealing at a career-high rate, which you can see in the chart below. For that, you could call it lazy, but it's pretty calculated laziness.

His defensive aggregate stats are significantly up, too, despite our horrendous defense, which currently sits at [25th out of 30 teams with an average Defensive Efficiency of 108.6](http://www.espn.com/nba/hollinger/teamstats/_/sort/defensiveEff/order/false) - but hey, we're better than Cleveland at least. Here are some of them:

-|BPG|BLK%|SPG|STL%|DBPM|DWS/48|DRPM|DRTG|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Career Average|0.1|0.7%|0.6|2.4%|-1.2|0.026|-0.63|107|
Career Best|0.1|0.7%|0.6|2.6%|-0.9|0.053|-0.31|105|
2017-2018|**0.4**|**2.1%**|**1.4**|**3.9%**|**0.3**|**0.069** (nice)|**0.15**|106|

The most important ones are DBPM and DRPM, which are HEAVILY influenced by the teammates around a player, and because those stats traditionally hate guards (because, on average, NBA guards are bad defenders relative to forwards and bigs - it's just how it is). Because we have such a terrible defense, the merit of breaking both odds and breaking even on both is phenomenal. Only 72 guards in the league PERIOD out of a qualified 208 even break positive at all.

Cam is currently sporting a better DRPM than Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Patrick Beverley, Mike Conley, Trevor Ariza, and even our guy Kris Dunn. But again, small sample size is important to note here.

DRTG is almost exclusively team-based, so that fact that he sits **almost a full three points better** than our team average speaks extremely well for not only Cam but also our bench in general for stepping up on that end.

#**CONCLUSION**

All of this could mean nothing at all. Basketball is notoriously one of the hardest sports to quantify impact statistically, and more importantly it's a game of streaks. 10 games is a very small sample size overall. All of that said, Cam's return has been much closer to a return on investment than we have ever seen from him, and that's including his days in OKC. A little comfort food for all my GarPax dissenters out there - things are getting better with time with this guy.

"Bulls are in 8th place in [the Tankathon](http://www.tankathon.com/), 2.5 games behind the Nets, Kings, and Mavs, and the 9th-place Knicks are closing fast, only a half game behind.  The Bulls have gone 3-7 in the last ten while the Knicks were going 1-9.  The Bulls beat the Mavs, Grizzlies, and Hawks.  The Bulls' next four games are the Clippers, Grizzlies, Cavs, and Knicks.  The Knicks' next four games are the Mavs, Sixers, Hornets, and Bulls.  At this point neither team is likely to catch the leaders, so it's all about fighting to be the 8th worst team in the league.

**Edit** Okay, we may well catch the Nets.  They have no incentive to tank.  Two of their better players, Caris LeVert and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, recently came back after injuries.

"Browsing twitter, Facebook and reddit after today’s “win” I’ve gotten the impression that most Bulls fans are angry with the organization and feel like our future is destined for mediocrity. The common sentiment is that the team won’t go anywhere without a superstar or high draft pick. I personally think this is overly cynical and dismissive of the talent pool on our roster.  People seem dead set on Dunn, Lavine, Markkanen and Nwaba not taking leaps in their game, destined to forever be second or fourth options on a champion level team.  Not to mention, history has routinely shown that great players are around picks 8-10 and we have loads of cap space. All of our players have taken huge developmental leaps this season and Hoiberg is proving that he is a serviceable coach.

"**Wendell Carter**- Very underrated prospect as a result of playing with marvin bagley. Great rebounder, decent defensively although wont be an elite rim protector, has a very dynamic offensive game including posting up, facing up etc. wont be able to shoot the 3 well his first year but the potential is there to develop a jumper. One really exciting aspect of his game is his passing ability from the post, this would fit really well with hoiberg's system and considering how 3 point heavy the bulls have been this could be fantastic if hes on the floor with multiple shooters and attracts enough attention in the post. Overall a very well rounded high floor player.

*NBA Comparison: Al Horford*


**Mikal Bridges**- One of the best 3 and D prospects in the draft, arguably the best wing defender in college basketball, has great length and decent athleticism. Also one of the best shooters in college basketball. Doesnt have much ability to create his own shot, most of his points come from catch and shoot and transition and drives mostly on closeouts, in the nba this could be a problem considering the level of defense at the wing position. Will at least be a solid role player if his shot translates to the nba, potential to be a star but this likely will take a while if it happens as he has to develop a variety of offensive tools. 

*NBA Comparison: Otto Porter Jr.*


**Miles Bridges**- Can play the 3 or 4, already has a solid build that will allow him to match up with nba wings and forwards well enough. Defense hasnt been as good as it can be, but the tools are there to develop into a solid defender at the 3 spot. Decent shooter, 3 point percentage has gone down this year but his free throw percentage has gone up drastically and his mechanics look solid. Struggles with creating his own offense and his more of a catch and shoot player who can drive on closeouts. His athleticism provides some hope for him possibly becoming a star one day but same as mikal this would take a few years as he has a lot of development to do offensively.

*NBA Comparison: Jae Crowder*

**My Opinion**: If all three guys are available to us (assuming all the top 6 or 7 players are gone) I would take Wendell Carter. He has a pretty high floor and will contribute to the team immediately, and I think his ceiling is higher than it seems because he hasnt gotten the ability to fully show his offensive game at duke. Having a playmaker in the post can be a huge advantage given the hoiberg's system and the rest of our roster and carter is incredibly well rounded overall. He can be the guy who doesnt demand the ball too often and doesnt need a lot of shots but can be one of the most impactful players on both ends of the floor.

"So a lot of people are obviously quite pessimistic at the state of our Pelicans draft pick right now on this sub, already conceding it as a mediocre asset / mid-twenties pick. However it's not all doom and gloom just yet. I'd even argue there's a possibility the Pelicans still slip back out of the playoffs and the Bulls end up with a lottery pick again. I'd thought i'd quickly summarise their remaining schedule for the sub to show why this might be the case. I'll try not to over-analyse any of the games as circumstances can change by the time these games actually happen (eg. injuries). Records will obviously be different on the date of the game, so i'm just listing them as they currently are (valid 3/10) for reference sake.

I will also make some observations at the bottom to conclude.
 

03/11: Home vs Utah Jazz (36-30) - At the time of writing this, Davis is a GTD. He's seen as a 50/50 but Gentry thinks he might play. Jazz are one of the hottest teams in the league right now, and if Davis misses the Pelicans will be large outsiders to win this. Even with Davis back, it's going to be tough.
 
3/13: Home vs Hornets (29-38) - I'll presume Davis will be back for this one, and at home vsing the hornets this should be one the Pelicans win.
 
3/15: Away vs Spurs (37-29) - Kawhi Leonard is expected to return from his absence for this game according to San Antonio, and thus will be a tough one for the Pels. Good chance they go down in this match considering it's away against a team invigorated by Kawhi's comeback.
 
3/17: Home vs Rockets (51-14) - These teams are split on the season at 1 a piece, however those two games featured Cousins in the lineup. (recorded a trip-dub in the pels win). Without both of the twin towers to dominate the small ball game houston likes to play, this will be a tough matchup for New Orleans.
 
3/18: Home vs Celtics (46-20) - A back to back against the Celtics is not going to be easy. Last game went to OT with the Pels getting up. Pretty 50/50 who wins this one.
 
3/20: Home vs Mavericks (21-45) - Not much to see here, the Pelicans should get this one done comfortably, despite the Mavs improving form.
 
3/21: Home vs Pacers (38-28) - This is the re-scheduled game after their last attempt was postponed. Pacers have been under the radar all season and have been really solid. On a back to back, this one is definitely a toss up.
 
3/22: Home vs Lakers (29-36) - This is a back to back to back game and will surely be a struggle against a young lakers squad who pushes the pace. Will be genuinely surprised if the Pelicans are the favorite here and the smart money will be on an upset if they are.
 
3/24: Away vs Houston (51-14) - One day off and then back into the frying pan @ Houston. Rockets will be deservedly favorites to win this one.
 
3/27: Home vs Trail Blazers (40-26) - Pelicans finally get rest after a brutal run, but it won't be easy against this blazers team. The three games so far this season have been close (all within 10 points), with the Pelicans holding a 2-1 advantage. The Blazers are the hottest team in the league at the time of writing this, if they can hold their form then this again should be close.
 
3/30: Away at Cavaliers (38-27) - Another few days off then they travel to Cleveland to face the Cavs. Obviously not an easy game, and this is around the time Kevin Love is scheduled for a return from his injury absence. Cavs will more than likely be favorites barring another injury or poor run of form.
 
4/1: Home vs Thunder (39-29) - The thunder's away record is pretty mediocre at the time of writing this, however obviously they have the talent to win on any given night. I'd lean to the pelicans but with the thunder anything can happen.
 
4/4: Home vs Grizzilies (bad/lots) - Grizz will probably get bodied. If Gasol is playing maybe the Grizz are within 25 by the time the 4th quarter starts. If not, RIP.
 
4/6: Home vs Suns (19/49) - Should be another win for the Pelicans here. Moving on.
 
4/7: Away vs Warriors (51/15) -  Back to back away at the warriors including travel. This is where standings may become relevant. If the warriors aren't locked into a particular seed at this point, then this will be a massively hard game. However they may rest some of their big names if their seeding is already decided, making this slightly easier. Difficult matchup regardless.
 
4/9: Away vs Clippers (36/29) - Provided the Clips are still in the playoff hunt, this will be another tough one. They're playing some great basketball after the Griffin trade and should have won last matchup after coming back from 20 down to lead in the last two minutes.
 
4/11: Home vs Spurs (37-29) - Talk about an unknown to end the season here. Each team could be locked into a seed by this point, and if the spurs are then expect some players to get the Pop treatment and miss this one. If the Spurs need a win though, expect a fully healthy squad including Kawhi to make this a big ask.
 
 
Observations:
 
1. They have a home-heavy schedule (11 home, 6 away) from here to wrap up the season
2. They play 12 of those 17 games against expected playoff teams
3. 13 of their remaining 17 games are against western conference teams. And the 4 eastern teams are Boston, Cleveland, Indiana, Charlotte.
4. They have 4 back to backs remaining, including a back to back to back, and a 7 games in 10 days stretch.
 
 
Thoughts/Conclusion:
 
Despite the majority of their final stretch being at home, this is by no means an easy schedule. They face a high number of western conference playoff teams, and even 3 of their 4 eastern matchups remaining are top 4 seeds. That alone would be enough for a tough run home, but adding in their brutal stretch of 7 games in 10 days, things start to get hairy and fatigue/injuries could become a factor. 
 
There's only 4 games remaining that I think are easy wins. It's not inconceivable that they post a below .500 record in their remaining 17 to close the season. In fact, I might actually be surprised if they go above .500 from here. Considering the slug fest that is the western conference right now, that probably wouldn't be enough to even make the playoffs, dropping their pick back into the lottery. There's very little room for error considering there are 10 genuine playoff teams in the west this year and only 8 spots. The Pelicans are currently only 2.5 games ahead of the 10th seeded Jazz right now, and a loss to them tomorrow would immediately drag them back towards the chasing pack of 5-10th. Even being optimistic for them, if they don't fall out of the playoffs I definitely can't see them holding onto the 4th seed.","A breakdown of the Pelican's remaining schedule So a lot of people are obviously quite pessimistic at the state of our Pelicans draft pick right now on this sub, already conceding it as a mediocre asset / mid-twenties pick.

3/21: Home vs Pacers (38-28) - This is the re-scheduled game after their last attempt was postponed. Pacers have been under the radar all season and have been really solid. On a back to back, this one is definitely a toss up.
 
3/22: Home vs Lakers (29-36) - This is a back to back to back game and will surely be a struggle against a young lakers squad who pushes the pace. Will be genuinely surprised if the Pelicans are the favorite here and the smart money will be on an upset if they are.
 
3/24: Away vs Houston (51-14) - One day off and then back into the frying pan @ Houston. Rockets will be deservedly favorites to win this one.
 
3/27: Home vs Trail Blazers (40-26) - Pelicans finally get rest after a brutal run, but it won't be easy against this blazers team. The three games so far this season have been close (all within 10 points), with the Pelicans holding a 2-1 advantage. The Blazers are the hottest team in the league at the time of writing this, if they can hold their form then this again should be close.
 
3/30: Away at Cavaliers (38-27) - Another few days off then they travel to Cleveland to face the Cavs. Obviously not an easy game, and this is around the time Kevin Love is scheduled for a return from his injury absence. Cavs will more than likely be favorites barring another injury or poor run of form.
 
4/1: Home vs Thunder (39-29) - The thunder's away record is pretty mediocre at the time of writing this, however obviously they have the talent to win on any given night. I'd lean to the pelicans but with the thunder anything can happen.
 
4/4: Home vs Grizzilies (bad/lots) - Grizz will probably get bodied. If Gasol is playing maybe the Grizz are within 25 by the time the 4th quarter starts. If not, RIP.
 
4/6: Home vs Suns (19/49) - Should be another win for the Pelicans here. Moving on.
 
4/7: Away vs Warriors (51/15) -  Back to back away at the warriors including travel. This is where standings may become relevant. If the warriors aren't locked into a particular seed at this point, then this will be a massively hard game. However they may rest some of their big names if their seeding is already decided, making this slightly easier. Difficult matchup regardless.
 
4/9: Away vs Clippers (36/29) - Provided the Clips are still in the playoff hunt, this will be another tough one. They're playing some great basketball after the Griffin trade and should have won last matchup after coming back from 20 down to lead in the last two minutes.
 
4/11: Home vs Spurs (37-29) - Talk about an unknown to end the season here. Each team could be locked into a seed by this point, and if the spurs are then expect some players to get the Pop treatment and miss this one. If the Spurs need a win though, expect a fully healthy squad including Kawhi to make this a big ask.
 
 
Observations:
 
1. They have a home-heavy schedule (11 home, 6 away) from here to wrap up the season
2. They play 12 of those 17 games against expected playoff teams
3. 13 of their remaining 17 games are against western conference teams. And the 4 eastern teams are Boston, Cleveland, Indiana, Charlotte.
4. They have 4 back to backs remaining, including a back to back to back, and a 7 games in 10 days stretch.
 
 
Thoughts/Conclusion:
 
Despite the majority of their final stretch being at home, this is by no means an easy schedule. They face a high number of western conference playoff teams, and even 3 of their 4 eastern matchups remaining are top 4 seeds. That alone would be enough for a tough run home, but adding in their brutal stretch of 7 games in 10 days, things start to get hairy and fatigue/injuries could become a factor. 
 
There's only 4 games remaining that I think are easy wins. It's not inconceivable that they post a below .500 record in their remaining 17 to close the season. In fact, I might actually be surprised if they go above .500 from here. Considering the slug fest that is the western conference right now, that probably wouldn't be enough to even make the playoffs, dropping their pick back into the lottery. There's very little room for error considering there are 10 genuine playoff teams in the west this year and only 8 spots. The Pelicans are currently only 2.5 games ahead of the 10th seeded Jazz right now, and a loss to them tomorrow would immediately drag them back towards the chasing pack of 5-10th. Even being optimistic for them, if they don't fall out of the playoffs I definitely can't see them holding onto the 4th seed.",31,25,A breakdown of the Pelican's remaining schedule,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/83makw/a_breakdown_of_the_pelicans_remaining_schedule/
"Decent game for the tank yesterday. The game I was most focused on was the Mavericks and they stomped the Grizzlies. That puts the Bulls 1.5 back of three different teams for the 5h lottery spot. 

Today is a very important day for the Bulls. We can't afford to keep winning against tanks if we are going to improve our draft standing, so our game agains the Hawks is a must-lose. Pelicans also play again, and there are 9 total games, all with some kind of impact on the Bulls.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Suns (19-48) 115

Hornets(28-38) 122

Suns were down the whole game, including a 22 point deficit going into the 4th. They managed to pull off a 43 point 4th quarter to almost win it, but the Hornets were able to hold them off enough in the end. Suns maintain their 4.5 game lead over the Bulls.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Wizards(38-28) 102

Heat (35-31) 129

Heat dominated the game, never trailing throughout. Wizards win would have been better for us, as they are closer to the Pelicans now. Heat could possibly catch the Pelicans too though if they really turn it on. Wiz are 1 game back and heat are 3 games back.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (18-47) 80

Mavericks(20-45) 114

Mavericks go to town on the Grizzles, who extend their losing streak to 17 games. Even against other tanks, Grizzlies are proving to be unstoppable in this late stretch in the season. This game was definitely the best for the Bulls, putting the Mavericks back within reach of us. It will hopefully also give the Mavs some momentum to grab some more wins.

**Good for the tank**

&nbsp;

Spurs (37-28) 94

Thunder(38-29) 104

Both teams were tied, so either win would help one team catch the Pelicans and hurt the other. I really thought the Spurs would be the better bet to catch the Pelicans but after today they have won just 2 of their last 10. They are still only 1.5 games behind the Pelicans after all that, so maybe they can put it together soon. There's reports of Kawhi possibly coming back against the Pelicans (good timing for us) next week so hopefully that will turn them around. Thunder are now just 0.5 games behind the Pelicans and could pass them soon.

**Neutral for tank**

&nbsp;

Magic (20-46) 105

Clippers(35-29) 113

Magic played very well in this game, keeping pace with a very good Clippers team and went into the 4th quarter with a lead. They then realized they might actually win this game and put up 8 points over the first 9 minutes of the 4th. That was enough for the Clippers to take the lead back and win it, staying in a playoff spot. Magic would have been 2 games ahead of us if they finished strong, but are now 3 games ahead and not looking as passable. Clippers win has them only 2 games behind the Pelicans, they are a good bet to pass them during the Pelicans tough stretch.

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Raptors (48-17) vs Knicks (24-42)

Spread: Raptors -9.5

Knicks are hot on our tail, and will almost certainly lose this. Could get 0.5 games back of us if we don/t lose today.

**Go Knicks!**

&nbsp;

Bulls (22-43) vs Hawks (20-46)

Spread: Hawks -3.0

Huge game for the Bulls, really need to loss this to keep our chances of improving our lottery spot alive. A loss here would keep the pressure on the three teams that are just 1.5 games ahead of us. It would also put the Hawks at 1.5 games ahead of us too. A loss here would pretty much throw away chances of catching the Hawks, make it a lot harder to catch those 3 teams that are close to us, and put the Knicks less than a game back of us. We need to lose these clutch games to really have a shot.

**Go Hawks!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

Warriors (51-15) vs Timberwolves (38-29) 

Spread: Warriors -5.0

Timberwolves aren't playing well and probably won't do much better against the Warriors. Timberwolves are only 1 game behind the Pelicans though and need to get a few wins soon if not today.

**Go Timberwolves!**

&nbsp;

Jazz (36-30) vs Pelicans (38-27)

Spread: No line yet

An opportunity for us to double dip, Jazz could get up to 1.5 games behind the Pelicans with a win today. Davis is likely back in the lineup (game time decision but he said he feels good) for the Pelicans though, so it'll be a very tough game. Jazz match up well agains the Pelicans though, and I think they will be able to win this whether Davis is in the lineup or not. There's always the chance Davis goes superhuman though, so the Pelicans always have that chance that he drags them to victory.

**Go Jazz!!!!!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

Kings (21-45) vs Nuggets (36-30)

Spread: No line yet

Kings have won a few recently, and the Nuggets just lost to the Mavericks the other night, so lets hope the Nuggets pull a Pacers and lose to two tanks back to back. Nuggets are still close to the Pelicans though so we can get some benefit from their win too.

**Go Kings!**

&nbsp;

Rockets (51-14) vs Mavericks (21-45)

Spread: Rockets -11.5

I was excited to see the Mavericks next game after destroying the Grizzlies, hoping the momentum would carry them to another win. Unfortunately I don't think momentum is going to be enough for this one. Let's just hope the Mavs can keep up their good play and keep the game tight.

**Go Mavericks!**

&nbsp;

Pacers (38-28) vs Celtics (46-20)

Spread: Celtics -6.5

Pacers are only 0.5 games behind the Pelicans and could pass them today, but it'll be tough agains the Celtics.Celtics aren't playing their very best now though, so a Pacers win still has a good chance.

**Go Pacers!**

&nbsp;

76ers (35-29) vs Nets (21-45)

Spread: 76ers -6.0

Both teams are playing inconsistently lately. 76ers looked hot for a while but have been up and down their last few. Nets looked really good in their last win, but have struggled to play a full game in the games before that. Nets win would be really big for us here and I really think they can do it.

**Go Nets!**

&nbsp;

Cavaliers (38-27) vs Lakers (29-36) 

Spread: Cavaliers -2.0

Cavaliers are tied with the Pelicans so we need them to keep winning, especially against teams like the Lakers that don't affect the Bulls at all.

**Go Cavaliers!**

"What a great day for the tank!!! Bulls lost, Pelicans lost, Kings won, and every single team that could possibly catch the Pelicans won yesterday. This puts the Bulls only 1.5 behind two teams, making up for the win we had against the Grizzlies. It also puts the Pelicans just 1 game away from falling back into the teens for their pick. Really great day for us yesterday and makes things a lot better going forward.

There are just five games today, but those five games feature four tanks that are playing. This includes a tank vs tank game so we'll be gaining ground on either the Grizzlies or Mavericks. There are also a few games that have teams that could catch the Pelicans. Let's hope for another good day for the tank!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Bulls (22-43) 83

Pistons(30-36) 99

Great loss to  get the tank back on track. Bulls lead the whole first half but went very cold in the second half, and the Pistons ended up taking it easily. We were so bad that Payne actually led the whole team in scoring. I wish that we saved this performance for tomorrow against the Hawks, because I don't think we were beating anyone with how we played yesterday.

We did not have the best game for our core players. Markkanen, Lavine, and Portis all shot terribly from the field. Robin Lopez actually made more 3's than the three of them combined. Dunn was pretty good, and had no turnovers so that's a good positive. I would hate for our core guys to play this bad the rest of the season, so let's hope they can pick up their play while we still lose.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Hawks (20-46) 87

Pacers (38-28) 112

Hawks were never close at all, they were down by over 20 for almost the entire second half. Hawks fall back to 2.5 ahead of the Bulls, and have a tough schedule too. Pacers move up to just 0.5 games behind the Pelicans, and have been playing well too. They are very likely to pass the Pelicans soon during their 5 game week.

**Bad for tank, Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Rockets (51-14) 105

Raptors (48-17) 108

Doesn't affect either of our draft picks but cool to see the Raptors beat the hottest team in the league.

**Doesn't affect us**

&nbsp;

Jazz (36-30) 95

Griz (18-47) 78

Grizzlies legitimately look like they won't win again the rest of the season. Unless they get a win or two soon, I'm going to give up hope for possibly moving ahead of them. Jazz keep playing really well but still can't manage to get their way into a playoff spot. They are only 2.5 games behind the Pelicans so lets hope the Jazz take their spot.

**Bad for tank, Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Knicks (24-42) 112

Bucks (35-31) 120

Knicks don't play too bad, but the Bucks played better and controlled the game. Knicks stay just 1.5 games behind the Bulls, always in striking distance if we get too many wins. Bucks gain a game to go 3.5 games behind the Pelicans. I'd say its improbable for the Bucks to catch them, but both are streaky teams that could be reversing their tune after today.

**Bad for tank, Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Wizards (38-28) 116

Pelicans (38-27) 97

THE PELICANS FINALLY LOST. Without Davis in there to dominate, the Pelicans just didn't look like a team that could compete with the Wizards. Pelicans stay tied for the 24th draft spot, but the lead they had on other teams shrunk a lot. One more loss (with the right teams winning) could put their draft pick back in the teens.

I do not know how long Davis will be out for but I believe he is day to day. Let's just hope the Pelicans lose as much as possible while he is out, because when he gets back on the court the Pelicans are a threat to beat anyone.

**Good for Pelicans pick x2**

&nbsp;

Lakers (29-36) 116

Nuggets(36-26) 125

Nuggets stay tied for the last playoff spot with their win today. They gain a game on the Pelicans to make them just 2.5 behind them now. 

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Warriors(51-15) 108

Blazers (40-26) 125

Trail Blazers take over the title of the longest active winning streak at 9 games. They also increase their lead over the Pelicans to 1.5 games. They look like they are about to run away with the 3 seed in the West if they keep this up. 

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Magic (20-46) 88

Kings (21-45) 94

Both teams played pretty bad, but the Kings played less bad and came out with the win. This makes the Kings the second most likely team for the Bulls to pass at the moment. Magic look good at times, but are tanking pretty aggressively to make sure that lower pick. I still think the Bulls can catch the Magic too, but I'm definitely less sure after tonight.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Cavaliers(38-27) 102

Clippers (35-29) 116

Clippers stay in the playoffs ahead of the Nuggets and Jazz with their win yesterday. They also gain a game to go 2.5 behind the Pelicans in the West. Cavaliers stay tied with the Pelicans with their loss, hopefully they can get a few wins soon to take a lead on the Pels.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Suns (19-48) vs Hornets (28-38)

Spread: Hornets -11.5

I don't think the Bulls catch the Suns anymore, but the Hornets don't affect us so we can still root for that Suns win here. Even with a win the Suns would be 3.5 games ahead of us, but nothing else to lose here.

**Go Suns!**

&nbsp;

Wizards (38-28) vs Heat (35-31)

Spread: Wizards -5.0

Wizards could tie the Pelicans record with a win today. Heat are hot though, so it should be a good game. Heat are not too likely to catch the Pelicans at 3.5 games back, but its not impossible if the Heat keep winning.

**Go Wizards!**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (18-47) vs Mavericks (20-45) 

Spread: Mavericks -9.0

A good tank vs tank matchup, but this one there is definitely a clear outcome that would benefit the Bulls more. The Bulls will almost certainly not catch the Grizzlies but still have a pretty decent chance to catch the Mavericks. The spread on this game show you just how much the Grizzlies are in another league when it comes to tanking. Mavericks win would put them just 1.5 games ahead of the Bulls.

**Go Mavericks!**

&nbsp;

Spurs (37-28) vs Thunder (38-29)

Spread: Thunder -4.5

The teams are tied for the 5 seed in the West, both are one game behind the Pelicans for the 4th seed. Whichever team wins, we need both of them to pass the Pelicans in the playoffs before the end of the season. Spurs get a very slight edge because they have the better winning percentage, but honestly just take your pick for whoever you think will be more sure to pass the Pelicans.

**Go Spurs!**

&nbsp;

Magic (20-46) vs Clippers (35-29)

Spread: Clippers -11.5

Both teams are very likely to get the same result today that they got last night. Magic are capable winning, but never finish any games in which they play well. Clippers are also just much better and are playing really well lately. Magic win would put them 2 games ahead of the Bulls in the lottery. Clippers win would put them 2 games behind the Pelicans in the West.

**Go Magic!**

This puts the Bulls only 1.5 behind two teams, making up for the win we had against the Grizzlies. It also puts the Pelicans just 1 game away from falling back into the teens for their pick. Really great day for us yesterday and makes things a lot better going forward.

There are just five games today, but those five games feature four tanks that are playing. This includes a tank vs tank game so we'll be gaining ground on either the Grizzlies or Mavericks. There are also a few games that have teams that could catch the Pelicans. Let's hope for another good day for the tank!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Bulls (22-43) 83

Pistons(30-36) 99

Great loss to  get the tank back on track. Bulls lead the whole first half but went very cold in the second half, and the Pistons ended up taking it easily. We were so bad that Payne actually led the whole team in scoring. I wish that we saved this performance for tomorrow against the Hawks, because I don't think we were beating anyone with how we played yesterday.

We did not have the best game for our core players. Markkanen, Lavine, and Portis all shot terribly from the field. Robin Lopez actually made more 3's than the three of them combined. Dunn was pretty good, and had no turnovers so that's a good positive. I would hate for our core guys to play this bad the rest of the season, so let's hope they can pick up their play while we still lose.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Hawks (20-46) 87

Pacers (38-28) 112

Hawks were never close at all, they were down by over 20 for almost the entire second half. Hawks fall back to 2.5 ahead of the Bulls, and have a tough schedule too. Pacers move up to just 0.5 games behind the Pelicans, and have been playing well too. They are very likely to pass the Pelicans soon during their 5 game week.

**Bad for tank, Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Rockets (51-14) 105

Raptors (48-17) 108

Doesn't affect either of our draft picks but cool to see the Raptors beat the hottest team in the league.

**Doesn't affect us**

&nbsp;

Jazz (36-30) 95

Griz (18-47) 78

Grizzlies legitimately look like they won't win again the rest of the season. Unless they get a win or two soon, I'm going to give up hope for possibly moving ahead of them. Jazz keep playing really well but still can't manage to get their way into a playoff spot. They are only 2.5 games behind the Pelicans so lets hope the Jazz take their spot.

**Bad for tank, Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Knicks (24-42) 112

Bucks (35-31) 120

Knicks don't play too bad, but the Bucks played better and controlled the game. Knicks stay just 1.5 games behind the Bulls, always in striking distance if we get too many wins. Bucks gain a game to go 3.5 games behind the Pelicans. I'd say its improbable for the Bucks to catch them, but both are streaky teams that could be reversing their tune after today.

**Bad for tank, Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Wizards (38-28) 116

Pelicans (38-27) 97

THE PELICANS FINALLY LOST. Without Davis in there to dominate, the Pelicans just didn't look like a team that could compete with the Wizards. Pelicans stay tied for the 24th draft spot, but the lead they had on other teams shrunk a lot. One more loss (with the right teams winning) could put their draft pick back in the teens.

I do not know how long Davis will be out for but I believe he is day to day. Let's just hope the Pelicans lose as much as possible while he is out, because when he gets back on the court the Pelicans are a threat to beat anyone.

**Good for Pelicans pick x2**

&nbsp;

Lakers (29-36) 116

Nuggets(36-26) 125

Nuggets stay tied for the last playoff spot with their win today. They gain a game on the Pelicans to make them just 2.5 behind them now. 

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Warriors(51-15) 108

Blazers (40-26) 125

Trail Blazers take over the title of the longest active winning streak at 9 games. They also increase their lead over the Pelicans to 1.5 games. They look like they are about to run away with the 3 seed in the West if they keep this up. 

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Magic (20-46) 88

Kings (21-45) 94

Both teams played pretty bad, but the Kings played less bad and came out with the win. This makes the Kings the second most likely team for the Bulls to pass at the moment. Magic look good at times, but are tanking pretty aggressively to make sure that lower pick. I still think the Bulls can catch the Magic too, but I'm definitely less sure after tonight.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Cavaliers(38-27) 102

Clippers (35-29) 116

Clippers stay in the playoffs ahead of the Nuggets and Jazz with their win yesterday. They also gain a game to go 2.5 behind the Pelicans in the West. Cavaliers stay tied with the Pelicans with their loss, hopefully they can get a few wins soon to take a lead on the Pels.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Suns (19-48) vs Hornets (28-38)

Spread: Hornets -11.5

I don't think the Bulls catch the Suns anymore, but the Hornets don't affect us so we can still root for that Suns win here. Even with a win the Suns would be 3.5 games ahead of us, but nothing else to lose here.

**Go Suns!**

&nbsp;

Wizards (38-28) vs Heat (35-31)

Spread: Wizards -5.0

Wizards could tie the Pelicans record with a win today. Heat are hot though, so it should be a good game. Heat are not too likely to catch the Pelicans at 3.5 games back, but its not impossible if the Heat keep winning.

**Go Wizards!**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (18-47) vs Mavericks (20-45) 

Spread: Mavericks -9.0

A good tank vs tank matchup, but this one there is definitely a clear outcome that would benefit the Bulls more. The Bulls will almost certainly not catch the Grizzlies but still have a pretty decent chance to catch the Mavericks. The spread on this game show you just how much the Grizzlies are in another league when it comes to tanking. Mavericks win would put them just 1.5 games ahead of the Bulls.

**Go Mavericks!**

&nbsp;

Spurs (37-28) vs Thunder (38-29)

Spread: Thunder -4.5

The teams are tied for the 5 seed in the West, both are one game behind the Pelicans for the 4th seed. Whichever team wins, we need both of them to pass the Pelicans in the playoffs before the end of the season. Spurs get a very slight edge because they have the better winning percentage, but honestly just take your pick for whoever you think will be more sure to pass the Pelicans.

**Go Spurs!**

&nbsp;

Magic (20-46) vs Clippers (35-29)

Spread: Clippers -11.5

Both teams are very likely to get the same result today that they got last night. Magic are capable winning, but never finish any games in which they play well. Clippers are also just much better and are playing really well lately. Magic win would put them 2 games ahead of the Bulls in the lottery. Clippers win would put them 2 games behind the Pelicans in the West.

**Go Magic!**

"Theirs no question that we need a rim protector and ive been following Myles this year mostly because hes on my fantasy team and also the pacers have exceeded everyones expectations. 

Theirs no question that the pacers have a situation with having two great Centers (whom are both 21yrs young). Myles is a great rim protector and doesnt demand the ball much while also playing very good defense. However, with myles not taking that leap that everyone thought he would make with PG gone and  with the emergence of sabonis who the Pacers got in PG trade. Both of these young centers cant coexist on the court at the same time partially with sabonis not being able to guard opposing 4s and Turners best ability is rim protection. 

Why this makes sense for the pacers? They add a young PF who fills their needs (stretch the floor, good defense, able to switch between 4/5) while also having a breakout year and posting career high numbers as well. 

Ideally, the bulls get Mikal Bridges with their top 10 pick and trade the pels pick with bobby for Myles

However, the Felicio signing really has me questioning both Garpax and how it will hurt us down the line. Looking at the situation a little deeper though reveals what I think is a four year plan laid out by Garpax. 

Before I get into how Felicio plays a role, let’s take a look at the next three summers following this one. 

2019: Kawhi Leonard hits the open market most likely as he will probably decline his player option. 

2020: same situation with AD 

2021: Giannis becomes an UFA. 

So, looking at this, I’m speculating that Garpax is positioning themselves to make separate runs at all three of these guys until they land one of them. 

How does Shrek factor in you ask? 

Pretty simple, after next year Rolo comes off the books. He could very well be traded before that time opening up a vacancy at center. So as we go into the offseason we have no five man on the current roster. Say we are able to create enough space to sign Kawhi. At that point we are dealing with little to no remaining space most likely to sign an adequate center. My thinking is that Garpax hopes Felicio can be developed by that point to being a cheap, solid rotation center that is better than the veteran minimums we might be choosing from at that time. 

Say we don’t sign Kawhi however, we then go into the next season needing to fill the five spot as well as reach the salary floor. Continuing to develop Shrek isn’t a bad option until we can make a run at AD the following season. 

We could go on all day with hypotheticals but the main point is this: Felicio was signed to the deal he received strictly as a developmental piece that can hopefully become a rotational player by the time Rolo is gone and we are creating max cap space to make a run at a superstar. Shreks development has been incredibly disappointing this season, but I don’t see it hurting us long term, as well as I’m hopeful he can find his footing in the next few years and show more of the potential we have seen before. I was confused as to why we locked him up for four years recently but I think it makes sense with our roster moving forward and the cap situation we will be facing.

"As the Pelicans pick continues to slide further and further back into the 20s, that pick becomes less and less valuable to the Bulls. Obviously a first round pick always holds some value, but so does the cap space to retain valuable players. So rather than obsess over which talented prospect might slide to #25 (or wherever the Pels pick ends up) how do people feel about the prospect of using that pick as an incentive for another team to take Felicio off our hands?

We have 3 young PF/Cs all more talented (and amazingly *all cheaper*) than Cris, but not all rebuilding teams are so loaded with decent big man prospects. I think another one of the bottom tier teams might be interested in Felicio for the same reasons that GarPax gave him that 32mil - he's young, can jump, finish at the rim, occasionally get up and block shots, and there's hints that he can hit a jumper at least as far out as Lopez.

Offloading his remaining 24mil contract, we'd need to take back somebody, but I think that for a young big man on a reasonable 3 year deal + the 25th pick, we could at least hope to get a serviceable rotation player, perhaps an actual backup SF or PG to play 15-20 mins a night behind either Dunn or Nwaba.

Obviously, the main focus of this trade wouldn't even be the player we get back, it would be getting that useless (for the Bulls) contract off the books. That's cap space that could be used to retain a guy like Nwaba long term, or to go towards extending Portis, or maybe even another couple of years of Lopez if we don't select a big man with the 8th pick. The Bulls are in pretty good cap shape, but little things like giving up 2nd round picks and having a few contracts tied up in players who don't contribute anything useful can be the difference between a good roster and a great one.

What do you guys think - would you be interested in using that extra 1st round pick as leverage to trade away Felicio insteading of picking a project player?

"Obviously, we got a lot of guys here disgruntled by the win last night vs the Grizzlies, but to be honest, I'd be disappointed with our young core if they couldn't beat a team of G-Leaguers + Marc Gasol... 


Where does that leave us? Approximately 18 games left in the season, knocking on the door of a top 5 pick but also stuck for weeks at the 8th pick. I myself have been hoping for as many losses after the ASB as possible so we can maybe get an MPJ, Ayton, or Doncic. However, I think we have to stop stressing. We are not going to lose to awful teams because we actually have young talented players, but will lose to stronger/more experienced teams. 



My point here is that you have to let it go and see how this shakes out. I actually would be very happy with us getting Mikal Bridges at number 8 and I think he's the safest player in this ENTIRE draft class. Let's review his portfolio:



**21 year old Junior at Villanova, leading his team to one of the best records in the NCAA. Elite 2-way player, 6'7 SF with a 7'1in wingspan, massive hands, 1.6 steals & 1.1 blocks a game. +50 FG%, 42 3PT%, 17.6 pts/5 rebs/2 ast. He's efficient, he's accurate from deep, he's athletic, he can play off-ball, he can handle the ball, he can shutdown opposing wings. He's spooky LONG. He's gotten more college experience than any other top 10 pick and is ready for a starting role in the NBA. He's the safest player in the draft and has Paul George/Kawhi Leonard potential.**



He's the perfect fit alongside a ball dominant back court and front court stud in Lauri. We need a highly efficient player in this draft. I don't think MPJ is as efficient and might not be the same superstar-guaranteed player he was before surgery. That leaves Mikal as the best wing in this draft for OUR team. Zach will need his shots, Lauri will need his, Kris too. Mikal will be able to play with all 3 of our young pieces, and we need a strong defensive player in this draft to solidify our defense. 



Picking 8th, where Mikal is projected, might just be a blessing in disguise. Other players in the top 5 have huge potential, but some glaring concerns as well. Ayton's work ethic has been put into question many times, Bagley's fit with Lauri is questionable, Doncic's transition to a more athletic game is also not sure, MPJ's health is a concern, Trae Young I won't even get into (lol). Bamba is booty offensively and would be more of a project player in his first few seasons, and IMO, we should keep RoLo as our main veteran to lead these young guys on the floor. STOP stressing guys, be happy that our young players can win/close out games, and if we lose -- so be it. Picking 8th might just be the best place to pick this year, just how picking 7th was the best place to pick last year ;)

**TLDR**: the tank isn't as potent as others, but Mikal Bridges might just be the best player for the Bulls in the entire draft. ","Is being the 8th pick a blessing in disguise?

"Before I get showered with downvotes let me just emphasize one more time that this is a SUPER HYPOTHETICAL PIPE DREAM SCENARIO that I just thought of and I realize there is LITTLE TO NO CHANCE of it actually occurring.

Let's say the Bulls get lucky in the lottery and wind up with the 2nd pick, and with it select MPJ. Let's assume that the core of Dunn, LaVine, Markkanen, and MPJ are strictly committed to an elite daily training regimen to prepare for the upcoming season. Let's also assume Anthony Davis' frustrations with the Pelicans come to a head after they get swept in the first round and he is sick of his efforts going nowhere with the team. 

 This draws the attention of the Bulls, who sometime after the draft offer a package of Bobby Portis, Robin Lopez and two future first rounders to the Pelicans in exchange for Davis.

The trade is pulled off and sends shockwaves across the league and social media, with debates of the trade's merit and the position this places both teams in firmly dividing fans.

How far do you see this lineup going in the following season, and then long-term:

PG: Kris Dunn

SG: Zach LaVine

SF: Michael Porter, Jr.

PF: Lauri Markkanen

C: Anthony Davis

Do the Bulls become the Warriors of the East, winning 60+ games a season easily? Perennial ECF contenders?

"Well yesterday was pretty much as bad as it could have possibly been for the tank. We got a win against a another tank, every other tank playing yesterday lost, Pelicans won, and the teams close to the Pelicans in record lost too. We're in a tough position now, 2.5 games back from 5 different tanks and just 1.5 games ahead of the Knicks. We shouldn't give up yet though, yesterday was definitely our toughest game for the rest of the year. We can make up for it with a fairly long losing streak, and if we start that streak now it will include losses to 3 other tanks coming up.

Today features 2 games featuring tanks, and the other 3 games with Pelicans pick implications. Getting a few quick wins from the other tanks in the net day or two could nullify our Grizzlies win and put us right back in contention. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Jazz (34-30) 104

Pacers(37-28) 84

With how much the Pelicans are winning I'm not sure if the Jazz will catch them, but they're doing everything they can to. Pacers are still behind the Pelicans too so we need them to win in the future.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Raptors(47-17) 121

Pistons (29-36) 119

Pistons make it closer than expected, but Raptors roll on. Neither team will come close to Pelicans or Bulls

**No effect for either pick**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies(18-45) 110

Bulls (21-42) 119

Bulls are yelled at by the commissioner for tanking, and then lose to a team holding out their best player in the 4th. The Grizzlies did manage to get the game all the way down to 1 point with 7 minutes left, but the Bulls were just the better team and put the Grizzlies away. We're now 4 back of the lottery lead, not giving us too much of a chance to catch the Grizzlies or Suns. After that there are 5 teams all tied at 2.5 ahead of us, so we're going to have to hope a couple of those teams catch fire soon.

On the bright side, our big 3 played really well yesterday. All 3 got over 20 points and shot over 50% from the field. Dunn was also clutch and had 9 assists as well. Holiday went 5-5 shooting (including 4-4 from 3) which really hurt us big time. If the commish didn't tell us to start him and we have someone else taking those shots maybe things are different.

**Bad for tank x2**

&nbsp;

Rockets(50-13) 110

Bucks (34-30) 99

Rockets win again, Bucks lose again, both teams have done a lot of that lately. Bucks still tied for the last seed in the East, now well behind the Pelicans pick.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Pels (37-26) 114

Kings(20-44) 101

Pelicans dominated the whole game, which means they got to rest their starters more for their upcoming 5 games in 6 days. Not good for the Bulls. Kings gain a game on us too with their loss. If the Pelicans can cool down they are still very vulnerable fall significantly in the West.

**Bad for tank, Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Cavaliers(37-26) 113

Nuggets (35-29) 108

Nuggets fall out of the playoffs, and 3.5 behind the Pelicans. They are playing well and could still catch the Pelicans, but the Pels are laying better. Cavs stay tied with the Pelicans though so that is a positive from this.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Magic (20-44) 107

Lakers(28-35) 108

Seriously fuck this game, one of the weirdest ref calls I've ever seen. The Magic were down 1 with 0.6 seconds left and had inbound pass to make. They tried an ally-oop but for some reason the clock people started it when the Magic threw the ball in, instead of when the player actually touched it. So the buzzer goes off while the ball is in midair and everyone is confused, and the obvious logical conclusion is to give the Magic another inbound pass. Nope. Refs decide to do a jump ball at midcourt which obviously gets rid of the last 0.6 seconds and the Magic don't get a chance to make a basket or draw a foul. I'm still really salty about that one, as it could have been at least one team the Bulls didn't lose any games to today.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Nets (20-45) vs Hornets (28-37)

Spread: Hornets -6.5

Nets please just stop fucking around and win a few of these games. They are losing games in the 4th like their tanking but they have no pick. If they play the way they did against us a week or so ago they can win this and a couple more but they just need to play a full game of good basketball. They are 2.5 ahead of us now but we still have the 2 games against them at the end of the season

**Go Nets!**

&nbsp;

76ers (35-28) vs Heat (34-31)

Spread: 76ers -1.0

76ers are hot, but the Heat are playing better recently too. 76ers could catch the Pelicans to improve that pick, but both teams could rise quite a bit in the East if they win enough the rest of the season.

**Go 76ers!**

&nbsp;

Celtics (45-20) vs Timberwolves (38-28)

Spread: Celtics -2.0

Timberwolves have fallen very far since the break, need to get back on track to overtake the Pelicans. Celtics will be tough and they also get Kyrie back for the game. Wolves are just one game back of the Pelicans but the Pelicans have 2 games in hand. 

**Go Timberwolves!**

&nbsp;

Suns (19-47) vs Thunder (37-29) 

Spread: Thunder -10.0

I'm almost rooting for the Thunder in this one with how far ahead the Suns are in the lottery race. I'm not going to quite give up on them yet but if we fall any further from the front I might give up on the Grizzlies and Suns. Thunder are two games behind the Pelicans in the West, could still pass them up. The Thunder aren't playing their best right now though and they will need to play much better to have a shot.

**Go Suns!**

&nbsp;

Spurs (37-27) vs Warriors (50-14)

Spread: Warriors -11.0

Spurs have been one of the worst teams in the league lately and playing the Warriors won't help. A win here would help us a lot, because the Spurs are just a game back of the Pelicans. If they continue to lose like this they will be further behind them soon, so a big win against the Warriors could be the best thing to get them back on track.

**Go Spurs!**

Seriously fuck this game, one of the weirdest ref calls I've ever seen. The Magic were down 1 with 0.6 seconds left and had inbound pass to make. They tried an ally-oop but for some reason the clock people started it when the Magic threw the ball in, instead of when the player actually touched it. So the buzzer goes off while the ball is in midair and everyone is confused, and the obvious logical conclusion is to give the Magic another inbound pass. Nope. Refs decide to do a jump ball at midcourt which obviously gets rid of the last 0.6 seconds and the Magic don't get a chance to make a basket or draw a foul. I'm still really salty about that one, as it could have been at least one team the Bulls didn't lose any games to today.

**Bad for tank**

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Nets (20-45) vs Hornets (28-37)

Spread: Hornets -6.5

Nets please just stop fucking around and win a few of these games. They are losing games in the 4th like their tanking but they have no pick. If they play the way they did against us a week or so ago they can win this and a couple more but they just need to play a full game of good basketball. They are 2.5 ahead of us now but we still have the 2 games against them at the end of the season

**Go Nets!**

&nbsp;

76ers (35-28) vs Heat (34-31)

Spread: 76ers -1.0

76ers are hot, but the Heat are playing better recently too. 76ers could catch the Pelicans to improve that pick, but both teams could rise quite a bit in the East if they win enough the rest of the season.

**Go 76ers!**

&nbsp;

Celtics (45-20) vs Timberwolves (38-28)

Spread: Celtics -2.0

Timberwolves have fallen very far since the break, need to get back on track to overtake the Pelicans. Celtics will be tough and they also get Kyrie back for the game. Wolves are just one game back of the Pelicans but the Pelicans have 2 games in hand. 

**Go Timberwolves!**

&nbsp;

Suns (19-47) vs Thunder (37-29) 

Spread: Thunder -10.0

I'm almost rooting for the Thunder in this one with how far ahead the Suns are in the lottery race. I'm not going to quite give up on them yet but if we fall any further from the front I might give up on the Grizzlies and Suns. Thunder are two games behind the Pelicans in the West, could still pass them up. The Thunder aren't playing their best right now though and they will need to play much better to have a shot.

**Go Suns!**

&nbsp;

Spurs (37-27) vs Warriors (50-14)

Spread: Warriors -11.0

Spurs have been one of the worst teams in the league lately and playing the Warriors won't help. A win here would help us a lot, because the Spurs are just a game back of the Pelicans. If they continue to lose like this they will be further behind them soon, so a big win against the Warriors could be the best thing to get them back on track.

**Go Spurs!**

"*I'll update soon with summaries 

We got an unexpected win from the Mavericks yesterday, which made it a better day than I was hoping for with our pick. But the Pelicans managed to get another win to go 9 straight, keeping their pick in the mid 20's for now.

Today will be the Bulls toughest remaining game. The Grizzlies are worse than they have any right to be, currently on a 14 game losing streak. On top of that, the commish is telling the Bulls which players they can and cannot play, so we'll have more Rolo and Holiday more now. The Pelicans have another game today too, with a chance to double dip against the Kings. Magic have a winnable game too.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

76ers (34-28) 128

Hornets(28-36) 114

76ers stay just 2 games behind the Pelicans for a better draft pick, and also just 2 games back from the Cavs for the 3 seed in the playoffs. 76ers got very even production from the whole lineup, and Simmons shot 8-9 and had 13 assists. 

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Hawks (20-44) 90

Raptors(45-17) 106

It was actually a pretty even game until the 4th quarter (there were 17 lead changes through the game). The Hawks played really well to keep pace and even lead briefly in the 4th, but Raptors buried them late. Hawks stay just 2 games ahead of us in the lottery.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Heat(34-30) 113

Wiz (36-28) 117

Heat played well but the Wizards shot 58% from 3. Wizards stay just 1 game behind the Pelicans.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Rockets (49-13) 122

Thunder (37-28) 112

Rockets are just too good right now. Thunder actually shot pretty well, but the Rockets never trailed in the second half. Thunder lose 2 in a row now to fall 1.5 games behind the Pelicans in the West. 

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Nuggets (35-29) 107

Mavericks(20-45) 118

Mavericks play extremely well to beat a very good Nuggets team. Yogi Ferrell lead the team with 24 points on 9-11 shooting. Ferrell and Dirk combined to shoot 11-14 from 3. Mavericks are still 2 games ahead of the Bulls, but as long as we lose at a decent pace, I think the Mavs are one team that will play well enough for us to pass in the lottery. Nuggets lose hurts the Pelicans pick a bit, with the Nuggets falling 2.5 games behind them now, but that is absolutely worth it to get a win from a tank.

**Good for tank, Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Knicks (24-40) 87

Blazers(38-26) 111

Trail Blazers win their 8th straight, never trailed outside of the first quarter. Lillard had another amazing game dropping 37 and shooting 8-11 from 3. Blazers keep holding back the Pelicans which is good for us, but the Knicks stay 2 games back of the Bulls which is bad for us. As long as well lose at a good pace we'll be fine, but if we string together a few wins the Knicks will be right there to swoop in.

**Bad for tank, Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Nets (20-44) 101

Warriors(49-14) 114

This was a very weird game. Nets lead a bit in the 1st, and then the Warriors went on a 25-0 run to take a 20 point lead. The Nets then battled all the way back in the 2nd to take the lead at halftime. The 3rd quarter was pretty even before the Warriors took over in the 4th. If the Nets didn't let the 25-0 run happen they might have upset the Warriors, but they seem to go on at least one terrible stretch per game that ends up costing them. Nets stay 2 games ahead of the Bulls, with 2 more games remaining against the Bulls.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Pelicans (36-26) 121

Clippers (34-28) 116

Davis goes right back to being unstoppable and drops 41 on the Clippers. Pelicans lead most of the game, but the Clippers came back to take a 4 point lead with just 2:05 left. Davis responded by scoring 6 straight point to take the lead back and the Pelicans won again. This win was especially bad for us, because it gives the Pelicans a 3 game cushion from falling out of the playoffs.

**Bad for Pelicans pick x2**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Jazz (34-30) vs Pacers (37-28)

Spread: Jazz -1.0

This one is hard because if the Pelicans definitely make the playoffs, we want the Pacers to win to lower the Pelicans draft pick. But if the Pelicans start losing more the rest of the season, the Jazz still have a chance to pass the Pels and force them out of the playoffs. For now I'm going to keep hoping for the best case scenario and root for the Jazz to win. Should be a good game, both teams have been pretty good lately and are on 3 game winning streaks

**Go Jazz!**

&nbsp;

Raptors (46-17) vs Pistons (29-25)

Spread: Raptors -5.5

No way the Pelicans come even close to either of these teams so it doesn't really matter for us who wins this. 

**Unlikely to affect either pick**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (18-45) vs Bulls (21-42)

Spread: Bulls -3.5

This is a huge game for the Bulls, definitely the hardest time we're gonna have getting a loss for the rest of the year. Losing this puts us just 2 games back from the Grizzlies and keeps the rest of the tanks still close to us. A win would put us 4 games back of the lead and at least 2 games back of every other tank. 

Holiday is back in the starting lineup today, but not Rolo thank goodness. Holiday was a big help for the tank the last time he played, and we're definitely going to need another big game from him today. 

**GO MOTHERFUCKING GRIZZLIES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

Rockets (50-13) vs Bucks (34-30) 

Spread: Rockets -6.0

Bucks win would help us out with the Pelicans pick, but the Rockets are on fire right now. Bucks could beat them with a good game, but they have been really bad lately. 

**Go Bucks!**

&nbsp;

Pelicans (37-26) vs Kings (20-44)

Spread: Pelicans -5.5

It's hard to see the Pelicans losing this one after 9 wins in a row, but it is a back to back for them and the Kings have looked a lot better lately. Kings also won the last matchup between these two, right after they lost Cousins for the season. 

**Go Kings!!!!!!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

Cavaliers (37-26) vs Nuggets (35-29)

Spread: Nuggets -3.0

Nuggets had a very helpful loss to the Mavericks last night, but now we need them to go back to winning to catch the Pelicans. The Cavaliers have the same record as the Pelicans right now and could also help us with a win, but the Nuggets have priority being in the West.

**Go Nuggets!**

&nbsp;

Magic (20-44) vs Lakers (28-35)

Spread: Lakers -6.5

Lakers are playing very well lately, and beating all the other tanks they have gone against. Magic are playing better than usually lately too though, and a win here would be very helpful whether the Bulls win or lose. 

**Go Magic!**

For now I'm going to keep hoping for the best case scenario and root for the Jazz to win. Should be a good game, both teams have been pretty good lately and are on 3 game winning streaks

**Go Jazz!**

&nbsp;

Raptors (46-17) vs Pistons (29-25)

Spread: Raptors -5.5

No way the Pelicans come even close to either of these teams so it doesn't really matter for us who wins this. 

**Unlikely to affect either pick**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (18-45) vs Bulls (21-42)

Spread: Bulls -3.5

This is a huge game for the Bulls, definitely the hardest time we're gonna have getting a loss for the rest of the year. Losing this puts us just 2 games back from the Grizzlies and keeps the rest of the tanks still close to us. A win would put us 4 games back of the lead and at least 2 games back of every other tank. 

Holiday is back in the starting lineup today, but not Rolo thank goodness. Holiday was a big help for the tank the last time he played, and we're definitely going to need another big game from him today. 

**GO MOTHERFUCKING GRIZZLIES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

Rockets (50-13) vs Bucks (34-30) 

Spread: Rockets -6.0

Bucks win would help us out with the Pelicans pick, but the Rockets are on fire right now. Bucks could beat them with a good game, but they have been really bad lately. 

**Go Bucks!**

&nbsp;

Pelicans (37-26) vs Kings (20-44)

Spread: Pelicans -5.5

It's hard to see the Pelicans losing this one after 9 wins in a row, but it is a back to back for them and the Kings have looked a lot better lately. Kings also won the last matchup between these two, right after they lost Cousins for the season. 

**Go Kings!!!!!!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

Cavaliers (37-26) vs Nuggets (35-29)

Spread: Nuggets -3.0

Nuggets had a very helpful loss to the Mavericks last night, but now we need them to go back to winning to catch the Pelicans. The Cavaliers have the same record as the Pelicans right now and could also help us with a win, but the Nuggets have priority being in the West.

**Go Nuggets!**

&nbsp;

Magic (20-44) vs Lakers (28-35)

Spread: Lakers -6.5

Lakers are playing very well lately, and beating all the other tanks they have gone against. Magic are playing better than usually lately too though, and a win here would be very helpful whether the Bulls win or lose. 

**Go Magic!**

"Go Grizzlies! We face the worst team in the NBA today. It will be a tough loss to find; they're on a 14 L streak and aside from the fact that they're already tanking, they're legitimately decimated by injuries. In their last game Chalmers and Harrison were both out so they literally called up a G-leaguer and played him 25 minutes because they didn't have any other ball handlers. With Adam Silver's hate-boner for our tank, if we have to play Lopez and Holiday we'll need some world-class shit play. We face Memphis again next week, and while it'd be nice to lose both I'd be happy with only 1 considering how unlikely it is. If I had to pick one to lose, it'd be today's, because it will keep our morale up as we stay close in the tank rankings.

 I think it's safe to say that a top 2 pick is no longer a realistic expectation with how Memphis and Phoenix are performing. I'd like to think 5th place is possible, because I do believe Dallas, Orlando, and Sacramento are capable of winning games that aren't flukes. 4th place would be great if Brooklyn could get their shit together.

"It has almost been 20 years since Bulls won their last championship. MJ retired after the second three-peat and the Bulls went through multiple rebuilds over these 20 years. Not every one here enjoyed watching MJ at his prime as majority on this sub are relatively young. Since we are going though another rebuild now I thought it would be a good time to recap what the Bulls went though in their first 10 years of rebuild before we drafted Derrick Rose.

**1998-99: The Rebuilding Begins**
After six NBA championships in the previous eight seasons, it was time for the Chicago Bulls to start over.

Chicago entered the lockout-shortened season without seven key components from the teams that won three straight titles from 1996-98. Michael Jordan retired and coach Phil Jackson took a year off. Scottie Pippen, Luc Longley and Steve Kerr left in sign-and-trade deals, and Dennis Rodman and Jud Buechler signed elsewhere as free agents.

Toni Kukoc was still in Chicago, and he led the team in scoring (18.8 ppg), rebounds (7.0 rpg) and assists (5.3 apg) as the Bulls finished 13-37 in Tim Floyd's first season as coach.

Despite all the changes, one thing stayed the same: The Bulls still drew a crowd, as the team's home sellout streak reached 567 games (regular season and playoffs). The last time Chicago did not sell out a home game was Nov. 17, 1987.

**1999-2000: Emergence of a Rookie**
In the Bulls first full year of rebuilding, efforts focused around the 1999 NBA Draft’s first overall pick, Elton Brand. In the 1999-2000 season, Brand joined an impressive group of NBA players, becoming only the 19th player in league history to average at least 20 points and 10 rebounds in a rookie campaign. In addition, he became only the second player in team history to average at least 20 points and 10 rebounds, joining Artis Gilmore.

As a team, the Bulls struggled in the franchise’s first full season without Michael Jordan, finishing with a 17-65 overall record. The Bulls attendance, however, continued to rank among the best in the league, extending the home sellout streak extended to 608 games (regular season and playoffs), the longest streak in the NBA at the time.

Brand was named NBA Co-Rookie of the Year (shared with Houston’s Steve Francis), MVP at the Schick Rookie Challenge during All-Star Break (setting record with 21 rebounds) and NBA Rookie of the Month for January, February and April. Brand’s best performance came on April 13, 2000, when he set a team record, hitting 14 straight field goals en route to a career-high 44 points versus Washington at the United Center.

The Bulls other first round selection, Ron Artest, also had a solid rookie season, earning him mention on the NBA All-Rookie Second Team. Other notes from the campaign included trading Toni Kukoc to Philadelphia as part of a three-way trade with Golden State, receiving the Washington Wizards first round draft pick in 2000, along with John Starks and Bruce Bowen and setting franchise record for fewest turnovers in a game (6) on March 7, 2000 at the United Center versus Atlanta.

**2000-01: Youth Reigns**
The Bulls’ intentions going into the 2000-01 campaign was to recruit a pair of the summer’s elite free agents—a group that included Tim Duncan, Grant Hill, Tracy McGrady and Eddie Jones—to be the core players in the re-building process. However, Duncan re-signed with San Antonio, Hill accommodated his wife’s desires to go to Orlando and McGrady and Jones both opted to play near their home towns.

“It wasn't so much a rejection of Chicago,” Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf stated, “as it was other considerations that compelled these individuals to make the decisions that they made to play for the teams they chose to play with.”

Thus, the Bulls changed gears and focused on rebuilding through the draft and with youth. In the 2000 NBA Draft, the Bulls took some steps in that direction, selecting Marcus Fizer (4th overall) and acquiring Jamal Crawford (selected 8th overall by Cleveland and immediately traded to the Bulls). Other notable off-season acquisitions included the signing of free agents Ron Mercer (Aug. 2) and Brad Miller (Sept. 7).

Opening the season with the youngest roster in NBA history—an average of 22.9 years of age and seven rookies—isn’t typically a recipe for success in the league. The Bulls went on to finish with a 15-67 record in Head Coach Tim Floyd’s second full season. The team broke the franchise record for longest losing streak at the United Center with an eight-game stretch from Nov. 11 to Dec. 19 (previous record was six games) and set a new record for consecutive losses with 16 from Jan. 8 through Feb. 6 (previous record was 13 games in 1976). In addition, Chicago endured the longest road losing streak in franchise history, dropping 25 straight on the road from Dec. 21 through Apr. 10.

The Bulls’ home sellout streak ended at 610 games on Nov. 3 vs. New Jersey, marking the third longest sellout streak in NBA history. Prior to that, the last time the Bulls failed to sell out a home game was Nov. 17, 1987, vs. Washington. Other news items from the season included second-year forward Elton Brand (sophomore team) and rookie guard Khalid El-Amin (rookie team) both participating in the Schick Rookie Challenge at All-Star Weekend and Marcus Fizer being named to the NBA’s All-Rookie Second Team.

**2001-02: Change of Direction**
In 2001-02, the make-up and direction of the Chicago Bulls changed significantly: by the season’s end, a pair of 18 year old phenoms and an All-Star caliber player were in the line-up while Elton Brand, once thought to be the franchise’s cornerstone for rebuilding efforts, was not. The result was a renewed sense of optimism and hope surrounding the team’s future with Tyson Chandler, Eddy Curry and Jalen Rose as the centers of attention.

It all began on the night of the 2001 NBA Draft, when the Bulls used their first-round pick, fourth overall, to select Thornwood High School’s Eddy Curry, a 6-11, 285-pound center. Minutes later, Chicago dealt Brand to the L.A. Clippers for Dominguez High School product Tyson Chandler (picked second overall) and Brian Skinner. Chicago also acquired one of the steals of the draft in Trenton Hassell out of Austin Peay in the second round.

With the addition of free agent Eddie Robinson (signed Aug. 7), the new look Bulls, a young and athletic squad, were ready to take the floor. The importance of having NBA experience was again displayed as the team struggled and finished the season 21-61. The beginning of the year was not pleasant for Chicago. The Bulls set a franchise record for worst loss with a 53-point loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Nov. 8. Head Coach Tim Floyd, who compiled a 49-190 record over four seasons with the club, resigned on Christmas Eve. Bill Berry was named interim coach and four days later, Bill Cartwright was named head coach on Dec. 28.

The team went on to suffer an 18-game road losing streak from Nov. 2 to Jan. 11and on Feb. 18, the Bulls grabbed a franchise-low 25 rebounds in Miami.

A change was needed and on February 19, it was delivered in the form of a seven-player trade. The Bulls acquired Jalen Rose, Travis Best and Norman Richardson from the Indiana Pacers for Brad Miller, Ron Artest, Ron Mercer and Kevin Ollie.

“We feel Jalen is an outstanding all-around player who can play three positions offensively and defensively,” EVP of Basketball Operations Jerry Krause explained. “He’s a very good passer, extremely unselfish, a fine scorer and in the prime of his career at age 29. His leadership qualities and versatility are an added plus.”

“I'm excited about it,” Rose said upon his arrival to Chicago. “I embrace the opportunity. Every kid dreams about standing in this position talking about having an opportunity to take a team to a championship level.”


**2002-03: A Rosy Future?**
The Bulls entered the 2002-03 campaign with an eager sense of anticipation on what the prior year’s moves would become.

Jalen Rose was expected to have a big year in his first full season with the club. The addition of Jay Williams, selected by the Bulls with the second overall pick in NBA Draft 2002, was expected to provide the team with an extra scoring punch. Plus, the team’s two young big men, Tyson Chandler and Eddy Curry, each had a valuable year of pro experience under their belts.

General Manager Jerry Krause had what many considered at the time to be a very successful offseason. Besides Williams, the Bulls also added Roger Mason, Jr. and Lonny Baxter via the draft. Veteran forward Donyell Marshall—signed with the team’s mid-level exception—brought size and versatility to the team, and the shape of a solid squad was beginning to form.

In the end, though, having Rose, Marshall and an abundance of talented youth did not equate to winning games. After starting the season 2-0 for the first time since the 1996-97 campaign, Chicago garnered a franchise-worst 3-38 road record. The Bulls held a 19-game road losing streak from 11/02/02–01/18/03 and the team’s 30-52 record qualified it for a fifth-consecutive NBA Lottery appearance.

The franchise was ready to head in a new direction and the beginning of that movement started with the resignation of long-time executive Jerry Krause on April 7. Krause, then 64, played a major role in building Bulls World Championship teams and was a two-time NBA Executive of the Year.

“Jerry Krause is one of a kind,” Bulls Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf stated. “He brought with him a vision of how to build a champion and he proceeded to create one of the most dominant champions of all time. No basketball fan in America can begin to imagine the World Champion Chicago Bulls without his imprint.”

One week later, the Bulls named John Paxson EVP of Basketball Operations. Paxson had spent the previous seven seasons as a color analyst on both the Bulls Radio and TV networks, providing expert analysis to the broadcasts. He spent one season (1995-96) as Assistant Coach, helping the Bulls to an NBA-record 72-10 record and the 1996 NBA World Championship.

“I am really excited to accept this challenge and look forward to working with the basketball operations staff,” said Paxson. “The Bulls organization has meant a lot to me over the years and getting the chance to help lead the team back to the upper echelon of the NBA is a true honor.”

**2003-04: Winds of Change**
Heading in to the season, Bulls fans were as optimistic as they had been in years. Before it was done, however, winds of change had blown through the Windy City leaving a roster and a coaching staff upside down.

After closing out the previous season with four solid wins in the final six games to reach the 30-victory plateau, the team was hopeful of reaching the playoffs for the first time since 1998 and new pieces were added to the team’s puzzle for that to happen.

First, Kirk Hinrich was taken with the seventh overall pick in NBA Draft 2003 to fill the void at the guard spot. This happened just days after the team learned it would be without services of Jay Williams, who was injured in a motorcycle accident in June and would miss this entire season.

Later in the summer, the Bulls brought back one of the sport’s all-time legends when free agent Scottie Pippen—a seven-time NBA All-Star, two-time Olympic gold medalist and one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history—returned to Chicago on 07/20/03.

“I think I know how to win games in the NBA. It may sound simple, but both winning and losing can become a mindset, and I won’t accept losing—ever. Whether it’s on the floor, in the huddle, at practice or just demonstrating a winning leadership, I plan on helping this team win,” said Pippen.

Just one month into the season, however, it became clear that expectations were not being met and changes were necessary. With a 4-10 record, the team relieved Bill Cartwright of his head coaching duties (11/24/03). A few days later, Scott Skiles was named head coach (11/28/03) as he set out to instill a tough, defensive-minded, and high-effort mentality upon his new team.

The Bulls makeover wasn’t done yet. A blockbuster of a deal went down on 12/01/03, when Chicago traded Lonny Baxter, Donyell Marshall and Jalen Rose to Toronto for Antonio Davis, Chris Jefferies and Jerome Williams.

“This trade helps us address a couple of different areas, areas that we needed to get stronger in. It not only provides us with size, but also with energy,” said John Paxson.

While the Bulls continued to struggle, improvements in effort under Coach Skiles were evident, and the roster re-make had only begun. The team’s 23-59 record qualified it for a sixth consecutive NBA Lottery appearance.

**2004-05: Skiles’ Style Works for the Bulls**
Scott Skiles’ first full season as Chicago’s head coach turned out to be an eventful one. Following a roller coaster ride of highs and lows, the team finished the regular season with a record of 45-37 en route to the postseason for the first time in six years.

The journey began in June, when general manager John Paxson had what could end up being his most successful draft, netting Ben Gordon (Connecticut) with the third overall pick and trading for Luol Deng (Duke), taken by Phoenix at the seventh spot. Chris Duhon (Duke) was also selected in the second round.

Paxson’s offseason work was far from done, as next he faced the dilemma of potentially overpaying the talented but youthful Jamal Crawford, or losing him to free agency for nothing in return. The end result was re-signing Crawford and trading him, along with Jerome Williams, to New York in exchange for Othella Harrington, Dikembe Mutombo, Cezary Trybanski and Frank Williams on August 8, 2004.
Chicago struggled at the onset of the regular season, beginning the campaign at 0-9 and tying the franchise record for worst start in club history (tied 1967-68 start). However, the Bulls, 4-14 by mid-December, showed great resilience and flashes of brilliance under Skiles and managed to reach .500 several weeks before the All-Star break. Along the way, the Bulls compiled an improbable 13-3 record during the month of January, best in the NBA.


Kirk Hinrich was the catalyst all season long, but much of the success was attributed to the team’s four rookies—Deng, Duhon, Gordon and Argentinean newcomer Andrés Nocioni. Gordon became first rookie to be named NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year, while he and Deng were also named to the got milk? NBA All-Rookie First Team.

The culture that Paxson and Skiles had hoped to create—one which focused on teamwork, defense, and playing hard all of the time—had been established. The Bulls qualified for postseason play for first time since 1998, and even though they were eliminated in first round by Washington (4-2), the franchise had as much confidence as ever in their young core for the future.


**2005-06: Bulls Make Second Consecutive Postseason Appearance**

","Year-by-year history of Bulls after Michael Jordan retired after second three-peat!! It has almost been 20 years since Bulls won their last championship. MJ retired after the second three-peat and the Bulls went through multiple rebuilds over these 20 years. Not every one here enjoyed watching MJ at his prime as majority on this sub are relatively young. Since we are going though another rebuild now I thought it would be a good time to recap what the Bulls went though in their first 10 years of rebuild before we drafted Derrick Rose.

**1998-99: The Rebuilding Begins**
After six NBA championships in the previous eight seasons, it was time for the Chicago Bulls to start over.

Chicago entered the lockout-shortened season without seven key components from the teams that won three straight titles from 1996-98. Michael Jordan retired and coach Phil Jackson took a year off. Scottie Pippen, Luc Longley and Steve Kerr left in sign-and-trade deals, and Dennis Rodman and Jud Buechler signed elsewhere as free agents.

Toni Kukoc was still in Chicago, and he led the team in scoring (18.8 ppg), rebounds (7.0 rpg) and assists (5.3 apg) as the Bulls finished 13-37 in Tim Floyd's first season as coach.

Despite all the changes, one thing stayed the same: The Bulls still drew a crowd, as the team's home sellout streak reached 567 games (regular season and playoffs). The last time Chicago did not sell out a home game was Nov. 17, 1987.

**1999-2000: Emergence of a Rookie**
In the Bulls first full year of rebuilding, efforts focused around the 1999 NBA Draft’s first overall pick, Elton Brand. In the 1999-2000 season, Brand joined an impressive group of NBA players, becoming only the 19th player in league history to average at least 20 points and 10 rebounds in a rookie campaign. In addition, he became only the second player in team history to average at least 20 points and 10 rebounds, joining Artis Gilmore.

As a team, the Bulls struggled in the franchise’s first full season without Michael Jordan, finishing with a 17-65 overall record. The Bulls attendance, however, continued to rank among the best in the league, extending the home sellout streak extended to 608 games (regular season and playoffs), the longest streak in the NBA at the time.

Brand was named NBA Co-Rookie of the Year (shared with Houston’s Steve Francis), MVP at the Schick Rookie Challenge during All-Star Break (setting record with 21 rebounds) and NBA Rookie of the Month for January, February and April. Brand’s best performance came on April 13, 2000, when he set a team record, hitting 14 straight field goals en route to a career-high 44 points versus Washington at the United Center.

The Bulls other first round selection, Ron Artest, also had a solid rookie season, earning him mention on the NBA All-Rookie Second Team. Other notes from the campaign included trading Toni Kukoc to Philadelphia as part of a three-way trade with Golden State, receiving the Washington Wizards first round draft pick in 2000, along with John Starks and Bruce Bowen and setting franchise record for fewest turnovers in a game (6) on March 7, 2000 at the United Center versus Atlanta.

**2000-01: Youth Reigns**
The Bulls’ intentions going into the 2000-01 campaign was to recruit a pair of the summer’s elite free agents—a group that included Tim Duncan, Grant Hill, Tracy McGrady and Eddie Jones—to be the core players in the re-building process. However, Duncan re-signed with San Antonio, Hill accommodated his wife’s desires to go to Orlando and McGrady and Jones both opted to play near their home towns.

“It wasn't so much a rejection of Chicago,” Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf stated, “as it was other considerations that compelled these individuals to make the decisions that they made to play for the teams they chose to play with.”

Thus, the Bulls changed gears and focused on rebuilding through the draft and with youth. In the 2000 NBA Draft, the Bulls took some steps in that direction, selecting Marcus Fizer (4th overall) and acquiring Jamal Crawford (selected 8th overall by Cleveland and immediately traded to the Bulls). Other notable off-season acquisitions included the signing of free agents Ron Mercer (Aug. 2) and Brad Miller (Sept. 7).

Opening the season with the youngest roster in NBA history—an average of 22.9 years of age and seven rookies—isn’t typically a recipe for success in the league. The Bulls went on to finish with a 15-67 record in Head Coach Tim Floyd’s second full season. The team broke the franchise record for longest losing streak at the United Center with an eight-game stretch from Nov. 11 to Dec. 19 (previous record was six games) and set a new record for consecutive losses with 16 from Jan. 8 through Feb. 6 (previous record was 13 games in 1976). In addition, Chicago endured the longest road losing streak in franchise history, dropping 25 straight on the road from Dec. 21 through Apr. 10.

The Bulls’ home sellout streak ended at 610 games on Nov. 3 vs. New Jersey, marking the third longest sellout streak in NBA history. Prior to that, the last time the Bulls failed to sell out a home game was Nov. 17, 1987, vs. Washington. Other news items from the season included second-year forward Elton Brand (sophomore team) and rookie guard Khalid El-Amin (rookie team) both participating in the Schick Rookie Challenge at All-Star Weekend and Marcus Fizer being named to the NBA’s All-Rookie Second Team.

**2001-02: Change of Direction**
In 2001-02, the make-up and direction of the Chicago Bulls changed significantly: by the season’s end, a pair of 18 year old phenoms and an All-Star caliber player were in the line-up while Elton Brand, once thought to be the franchise’s cornerstone for rebuilding efforts, was not. The result was a renewed sense of optimism and hope surrounding the team’s future with Tyson Chandler, Eddy Curry and Jalen Rose as the centers of attention.

It all began on the night of the 2001 NBA Draft, when the Bulls used their first-round pick, fourth overall, to select Thornwood High School’s Eddy Curry, a 6-11, 285-pound center. Minutes later, Chicago dealt Brand to the L.A. Clippers for Dominguez High School product Tyson Chandler (picked second overall) and Brian Skinner. Chicago also acquired one of the steals of the draft in Trenton Hassell out of Austin Peay in the second round.

With the addition of free agent Eddie Robinson (signed Aug. 7), the new look Bulls, a young and athletic squad, were ready to take the floor. The importance of having NBA experience was again displayed as the team struggled and finished the season 21-61. The beginning of the year was not pleasant for Chicago. The Bulls set a franchise record for worst loss with a 53-point loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Nov. 8. Head Coach Tim Floyd, who compiled a 49-190 record over four seasons with the club, resigned on Christmas Eve. Bill Berry was named interim coach and four days later, Bill Cartwright was named head coach on Dec. 28.

The team went on to suffer an 18-game road losing streak from Nov. 2 to Jan. 11and on Feb. 18, the Bulls grabbed a franchise-low 25 rebounds in Miami.

A change was needed and on February 19, it was delivered in the form of a seven-player trade. The Bulls acquired Jalen Rose, Travis Best and Norman Richardson from the Indiana Pacers for Brad Miller, Ron Artest, Ron Mercer and Kevin Ollie.

“We feel Jalen is an outstanding all-around player who can play three positions offensively and defensively,” EVP of Basketball Operations Jerry Krause explained. “He’s a very good passer, extremely unselfish, a fine scorer and in the prime of his career at age 29. His leadership qualities and versatility are an added plus.”

“I'm excited about it,” Rose said upon his arrival to Chicago. “I embrace the opportunity. Every kid dreams about standing in this position talking about having an opportunity to take a team to a championship level.”


**2002-03: A Rosy Future?**
The Bulls entered the 2002-03 campaign with an eager sense of anticipation on what the prior year’s moves would become.

Jalen Rose was expected to have a big year in his first full season with the club. The addition of Jay Williams, selected by the Bulls with the second overall pick in NBA Draft 2002, was expected to provide the team with an extra scoring punch. Plus, the team’s two young big men, Tyson Chandler and Eddy Curry, each had a valuable year of pro experience under their belts.

General Manager Jerry Krause had what many considered at the time to be a very successful offseason. Besides Williams, the Bulls also added Roger Mason, Jr. and Lonny Baxter via the draft. Veteran forward Donyell Marshall—signed with the team’s mid-level exception—brought size and versatility to the team, and the shape of a solid squad was beginning to form.

In the end, though, having Rose, Marshall and an abundance of talented youth did not equate to winning games. After starting the season 2-0 for the first time since the 1996-97 campaign, Chicago garnered a franchise-worst 3-38 road record. The Bulls held a 19-game road losing streak from 11/02/02–01/18/03 and the team’s 30-52 record qualified it for a fifth-consecutive NBA Lottery appearance.

The franchise was ready to head in a new direction and the beginning of that movement started with the resignation of long-time executive Jerry Krause on April 7. Krause, then 64, played a major role in building Bulls World Championship teams and was a two-time NBA Executive of the Year.

“Jerry Krause is one of a kind,” Bulls Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf stated. “He brought with him a vision of how to build a champion and he proceeded to create one of the most dominant champions of all time. No basketball fan in America can begin to imagine the World Champion Chicago Bulls without his imprint.”

One week later, the Bulls named John Paxson EVP of Basketball Operations. Paxson had spent the previous seven seasons as a color analyst on both the Bulls Radio and TV networks, providing expert analysis to the broadcasts. He spent one season (1995-96) as Assistant Coach, helping the Bulls to an NBA-record 72-10 record and the 1996 NBA World Championship.

“I am really excited to accept this challenge and look forward to working with the basketball operations staff,” said Paxson. “The Bulls organization has meant a lot to me over the years and getting the chance to help lead the team back to the upper echelon of the NBA is a true honor.”

**2003-04: Winds of Change**
Heading in to the season, Bulls fans were as optimistic as they had been in years. Before it was done, however, winds of change had blown through the Windy City leaving a roster and a coaching staff upside down.

After closing out the previous season with four solid wins in the final six games to reach the 30-victory plateau, the team was hopeful of reaching the playoffs for the first time since 1998 and new pieces were added to the team’s puzzle for that to happen.

First, Kirk Hinrich was taken with the seventh overall pick in NBA Draft 2003 to fill the void at the guard spot. This happened just days after the team learned it would be without services of Jay Williams, who was injured in a motorcycle accident in June and would miss this entire season.

Later in the summer, the Bulls brought back one of the sport’s all-time legends when free agent Scottie Pippen—a seven-time NBA All-Star, two-time Olympic gold medalist and one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history—returned to Chicago on 07/20/03.

“I think I know how to win games in the NBA. It may sound simple, but both winning and losing can become a mindset, and I won’t accept losing—ever. Whether it’s on the floor, in the huddle, at practice or just demonstrating a winning leadership, I plan on helping this team win,” said Pippen.

Just one month into the season, however, it became clear that expectations were not being met and changes were necessary. With a 4-10 record, the team relieved Bill Cartwright of his head coaching duties (11/24/03). A few days later, Scott Skiles was named head coach (11/28/03) as he set out to instill a tough, defensive-minded, and high-effort mentality upon his new team.

The Bulls makeover wasn’t done yet. A blockbuster of a deal went down on 12/01/03, when Chicago traded Lonny Baxter, Donyell Marshall and Jalen Rose to Toronto for Antonio Davis, Chris Jefferies and Jerome Williams.

“This trade helps us address a couple of different areas, areas that we needed to get stronger in. It not only provides us with size, but also with energy,” said John Paxson.

While the Bulls continued to struggle, improvements in effort under Coach Skiles were evident, and the roster re-make had only begun. The team’s 23-59 record qualified it for a sixth consecutive NBA Lottery appearance.

**2004-05: Skiles’ Style Works for the Bulls**
Scott Skiles’ first full season as Chicago’s head coach turned out to be an eventful one. Following a roller coaster ride of highs and lows, the team finished the regular season with a record of 45-37 en route to the postseason for the first time in six years.

The journey began in June, when general manager John Paxson had what could end up being his most successful draft, netting Ben Gordon (Connecticut) with the third overall pick and trading for Luol Deng (Duke), taken by Phoenix at the seventh spot. Chris Duhon (Duke) was also selected in the second round.

Paxson’s offseason work was far from done, as next he faced the dilemma of potentially overpaying the talented but youthful Jamal Crawford, or losing him to free agency for nothing in return. The end result was re-signing Crawford and trading him, along with Jerome Williams, to New York in exchange for Othella Harrington, Dikembe Mutombo, Cezary Trybanski and Frank Williams on August 8, 2004.
Chicago struggled at the onset of the regular season, beginning the campaign at 0-9 and tying the franchise record for worst start in club history (tied 1967-68 start). However, the Bulls, 4-14 by mid-December, showed great resilience and flashes of brilliance under Skiles and managed to reach .500 several weeks before the All-Star break. Along the way, the Bulls compiled an improbable 13-3 record during the month of January, best in the NBA.


Kirk Hinrich was the catalyst all season long, but much of the success was attributed to the team’s four rookies—Deng, Duhon, Gordon and Argentinean newcomer Andrés Nocioni. Gordon became first rookie to be named NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year, while he and Deng were also named to the got milk? NBA All-Rookie First Team.

The culture that Paxson and Skiles had hoped to create—one which focused on teamwork, defense, and playing hard all of the time—had been established. The Bulls qualified for postseason play for first time since 1998, and even though they were eliminated in first round by Washington (4-2), the franchise had as much confidence as ever in their young core for the future.

"We got our job done yesterday, but none of the other tanks could manage a win. On the bright side, all of the games that could have helped the Pelicans pick went our way. So if the Pelicans ever start losing there will be plenty of teams waiting to pass them up.

Today there are four tanks playing, but they once again all have pretty tough games so I doubt we gain any games for our pick today. The Pelicans pick has a lot of chances to gain ground though, most of all with the Pelicans facing the Clippers. A loss for the Pelicans today take their pick from mid twenties to high teens if the games go our way.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Pistons(29-35) 90

Cavs (37-26) 112

Cavaliers won pretty easily, Pistons aren't playing well at all lately. Pistons are now 5 games out of a playoff spot, and not looking like they are going to be able to close that gap. Cavs move back ahead of the Pelicans for the time, the only team in the East (not including Raptors and Celtics) with a better record than the Pels.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Bucks (34-30) 89

Pacers(37-27) 92

Pacers tie the Pelicans with their win today. Bucks fall into a tie with the Heat for the last playoff spot in the East. Bucks aren't likely to fall out of the playoffs with how bad the Pistons are, but they need to pick it up if they want better than the 8 seed.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Suns (19-47) 103

Heat (34-30) 125

Suns were down big for pretty much the whole game, never really in it. They are back into the top lottery spot and are fighting the Grizzlies to keep it. They don't look very catchable for the Bulls, 3.5 games back right now, but we do have a few games in hand.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Celtics(45-20) 105

Bulls (21-42) 89

Great tank effort for the Bulls tonight, wish we could have saved it for the Grizzlies on Wednesday. If you missed the game we only scored 29 points in the whole first half, and we were almost down 40 in the third quarter. I honestly hope we don't look THIS bad the whole rest of the season, but it would help our draft position a lot if we could play like that against the three other tanks we play in our next 5 games. 

Markkanen played pretty well and Valentine shot really well, but other than that most players were pretty bad. Lavine and Dunn were not good at all, and Portis had a pretty bad game too.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies(18-45) 98

Spurs (37-27) 100

I knew the Spurs were playing bad, but I can't believe they almost lost to the Grizzlies. Would have been nice to gain a game to the only tank team still stuck on 18 wins, but its also good for the Pelicans pick that the Spurs got a win. Spurs need to figure their shit out before they drop out of the playoffs.

Here's a cool article about the Grizzlies tank and how Marc Gasol is dealing with it. Thanks to /u/zedrix_ for sending it to me. Talks about how Gasol is sitting in back to backs, so luckily we're playing the Grizzlies on a day of rest.

https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/sports/nba/grizzlies/2018/03/04/memphis-grizzlies-pau-gasol-says-marc-gasol-should-upset/393121002/


**Bad for tank, Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Magic(20-44) 80

Jazz (34-30) 94

Magic actually had a decent game and kept it close for a while, but then forgot how to score in the 4th. They have probably been the best looking team out of the tanks lately and they will win several more games before the end of the season. Jazz keep pace in the West, still in position to strike if anyone (hopefully the Pelicans) starts to lose.

**Bad for tank, Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Blazers(38-26) 108

Lakers (28-35) 103

Lakers came really close to screwing us over again, leading by 11 with 5 minutes left in the 4th. Luckily the Trail Blazers (especially Lillard) came back to win it and keep the 3 seed in the West ahead of the Pelicans. 

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

76ers (34-28) vs Hornets (28-36)

Spread: 76ers -1.5

Hornets won't be affecting anything, but the 76ers are just 2 games behind the Pelicans right now. They are hot and could catch the Pelicans soon. Pelicans would have to start losing for that to happen though, hopefully starting today.

**Go 76ers!**

&nbsp;

Hawks (20-44) vs Raptors (45-17)

Spread: Rockets -13.0

A Hawks win would be pretty awesome and put us just 1 game back of them, but no way they beat the Raptors at home. That won't stop me from getting my hopes up when I see they're only down single digits in the 2nd quarter though.

**Go Hawks!**

&nbsp;

Heat (34-30) vs Wizards (36-28)

Spread: Wizards -5.0

Heat can't really help us anymore, but the Wizards could tie up the Pelicans record today. Wiz are on a 3 game losing streak though, need to snap out of that tonight.

**Go Wizards!**

&nbsp;

Rockets (49-13) vs Thunder (37-28) 

Spread: Rockets -4.5

I doubt the Thunder are the team to stop the Rockets, but if their big 3 play well who knows. Thunder are just 0.5 games behind the Pelicans in the West and could possibly pass them with a win here.

**Go Thunder!**

&nbsp;

Nuggets (35-28) vs Mavericks (19-45)

Spread: Nuggets -4.5

Nuggets are hot but the Mavericks are at home and have had some decent games lately. This is probably our best bet at a tank win today. Nuggets win would help us too, with them just 1.5 games behind the Pelicans in the West now.

**Go Mavericks!**

&nbsp;

Knicks (24-40) vs Trail Blazers (38-26)

Spread: Trail Blazers -9.5

Trail Blazers are playing really well on their 7 game winning streak. I don't see the Knicks ending that with their 4 game losing streak and 1-9 in their last 10. Knicks are just 2.5 games behind us right now, not nearly enough breathing room to be comfortable. Trail Blazers win is good for us too, they need to keep winning to stay ahead of the Pelicans. Knicks have priority though, since they affect the more important of the two picks.

**Go Knicks!**

&nbsp;

Nets (20-44) vs Warriors (49-14)

Spread: Warriors -14.0

Nets are playing okay for stretches in games but can't keep it up long enough to win a few games. I doubt that starts tonight against the Warriors, but maybe we'll get lucky. A win would put the Bulls just 1 game back of the Nets.

**Go Nets!**

&nbsp;

Pelicans (36-26) vs Clippers (34-28)

Spread: Clippers -3.0

Huge game for the Pelicans pick. Pelicans are on fire but the Clippers are playing very well too and could finally be the team to stop the Pels winning streak. The Clippers winning could move the Pelicans down several spots, and it would move the Clippers up to just 1 game back. 

**Go Clippers!**

Odds for each lottery spot: http://www.tankathon.com/pick_odds

* Bulls pick is currently at 8 and we are 3.5 games back of the top spot. 

* Bulls are 1.5 games behind the Magic, Nets, Hawks, and Kings for the 4th spot

* Pelicans are tied for the 21st spot in the draft, 2 games from slipping out of the playoffs and 1 game from the 5th best record in the league (as high as they can realistically go)","Tank Watch: March 6th, 2018 We got our job done yesterday, but none of the other tanks could manage a win. On the bright side, all of the games that could have helped the Pelicans pick went our way. So if the Pelicans ever start losing there will be plenty of teams waiting to pass them up.

Today there are four tanks playing, but they once again all have pretty tough games so I doubt we gain any games for our pick today. The Pelicans pick has a lot of chances to gain ground though, most of all with the Pelicans facing the Clippers. A loss for the Pelicans today take their pick from mid twenties to high teens if the games go our way.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Pistons(29-35) 90

Cavs (37-26) 112

Cavaliers won pretty easily, Pistons aren't playing well at all lately. Pistons are now 5 games out of a playoff spot, and not looking like they are going to be able to close that gap. Cavs move back ahead of the Pelicans for the time, the only team in the East (not including Raptors and Celtics) with a better record than the Pels.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Bucks (34-30) 89

Pacers(37-27) 92

Pacers tie the Pelicans with their win today. Bucks fall into a tie with the Heat for the last playoff spot in the East. Bucks aren't likely to fall out of the playoffs with how bad the Pistons are, but they need to pick it up if they want better than the 8 seed.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Suns (19-47) 103

Heat (34-30) 125

Suns were down big for pretty much the whole game, never really in it. They are back into the top lottery spot and are fighting the Grizzlies to keep it. They don't look very catchable for the Bulls, 3.5 games back right now, but we do have a few games in hand.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Celtics(45-20) 105

Bulls (21-42) 89

Great tank effort for the Bulls tonight, wish we could have saved it for the Grizzlies on Wednesday. If you missed the game we only scored 29 points in the whole first half, and we were almost down 40 in the third quarter. I honestly hope we don't look THIS bad the whole rest of the season, but it would help our draft position a lot if we could play like that against the three other tanks we play in our next 5 games. 

Markkanen played pretty well and Valentine shot really well, but other than that most players were pretty bad. Lavine and Dunn were not good at all, and Portis had a pretty bad game too.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies(18-45) 98

Spurs (37-27) 100

I knew the Spurs were playing bad, but I can't believe they almost lost to the Grizzlies. Would have been nice to gain a game to the only tank team still stuck on 18 wins, but its also good for the Pelicans pick that the Spurs got a win. Spurs need to figure their shit out before they drop out of the playoffs.

Here's a cool article about the Grizzlies tank and how Marc Gasol is dealing with it. Thanks to /u/zedrix_ for sending it to me. Talks about how Gasol is sitting in back to backs, so luckily we're playing the Grizzlies on a day of rest.

**Bad for tank, Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Magic(20-44) 80

Jazz (34-30) 94

Magic actually had a decent game and kept it close for a while, but then forgot how to score in the 4th. They have probably been the best looking team out of the tanks lately and they will win several more games before the end of the season. Jazz keep pace in the West, still in position to strike if anyone (hopefully the Pelicans) starts to lose.

**Bad for tank, Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Blazers(38-26) 108

Lakers (28-35) 103

Lakers came really close to screwing us over again, leading by 11 with 5 minutes left in the 4th. Luckily the Trail Blazers (especially Lillard) came back to win it and keep the 3 seed in the West ahead of the Pelicans. 

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

76ers (34-28) vs Hornets (28-36)

Spread: 76ers -1.5

Hornets won't be affecting anything, but the 76ers are just 2 games behind the Pelicans right now. They are hot and could catch the Pelicans soon. Pelicans would have to start losing for that to happen though, hopefully starting today.

**Go 76ers!**

&nbsp;

Hawks (20-44) vs Raptors (45-17)

Spread: Rockets -13.0

A Hawks win would be pretty awesome and put us just 1 game back of them, but no way they beat the Raptors at home. That won't stop me from getting my hopes up when I see they're only down single digits in the 2nd quarter though.

**Go Hawks!**

&nbsp;

Heat (34-30) vs Wizards (36-28)

Spread: Wizards -5.0

Heat can't really help us anymore, but the Wizards could tie up the Pelicans record today. Wiz are on a 3 game losing streak though, need to snap out of that tonight.

**Go Wizards!**

&nbsp;

Rockets (49-13) vs Thunder (37-28) 

Spread: Rockets -4.5

I doubt the Thunder are the team to stop the Rockets, but if their big 3 play well who knows. Thunder are just 0.5 games behind the Pelicans in the West and could possibly pass them with a win here.

"###Disclaimer: This was written as a non-Reddit piece, so it's a little long and has some intro stuff for less-tuned-in Chicago fans.

There are very few reasons to watch the Bulls this year, so it can be forgiven if you don’t initially recognize the number 11 Chicago jersey streaking up the floor. He doesn’t shoot it like Korver or pass it like Rondo, but the muscular guard draws attention just the same. Maybe it’s the way he throws himself at rebounds. Maybe the way he hassles the primary ball-handler. Each bump from the opposition seems to fire him up, his body transferring the kinetic force into his own energy. This is David Nwaba—the closest approximation to Chicago’s own Black Panther.

When the Bulls first announced their signing of Nwaba off of waivers, the common response from fans was a slight shrug and a continuation of their daily routine. No one cared about a 6’4 guard who played like a power forward. Why bother learning his name when he might not even make it through preseason play?

Of course, Nwaba hardly had an eye-catching resume. While his origin story has been somewhat documented since he entered the league, some things bear repeating. In his senior year at Cal Poly, Nwaba’s shooting splits would make Daryl Morey’s eyes bleed: 46.2% from the field (acceptable), 62.3% from the free throw line (yikes, a little concerning), and a bottom-of-the-well three-point percentage of 14.3%. He went undrafted, taking the Jonathan Simmons route to an NBA contract: bought a tryout spot, joined the D-League, and was eventually called up to the Lakers for a few short opportunities before joining them for the rest of the season. Waived during the summer, he found himself with the Bulls, who themselves were in a position of flux as they began their rebuild.

Nwaba was still anything but a shooter when he first donned the Chicago uniform. Instead, he was the “effort guy” that devoted fans of a team salivate over: TJ McConnell, Amir Johnson, even Omer Asik circa-2011. These guys may have concrete limitations in their games (athleticism, knees, and fundamental skill, in that order) but each have found ways to contribute to their teams through the years.

Nwaba’s limitation was his shooting inability, but he’s found ways to profoundly impact the game whether or not teams are respecting his jumper (yes, some teams still haven’t read the scouting report and play him tight around the arc). Of the five Bulls four-man lineups to have a positive plus-minus for the year, four have contained Nwaba. His DRtg (109) is lower than the Chicago average (110.4). He’s second on the team in DBPM (1.4). He’s one of only three players (the others being Markkanen and Portis) to post 1+ Win Shares on both the defensive and offensive sides of the ball. While defensive stats are still of undetermined accuracy, Nwaba grading out respectably in every category is telling. His constant effort to [break up passes](https://gfycat.com/AstonishingDangerousEagle) and [poke balls out of the hands](https://gfycat.com/DapperInfiniteEider) of opponents is the stuff of an All-Pro cornerback, and it shows in the numbers.

These aren’t your average camping-in-the-lane steals. Nwaba is tracking the play and then disrupting it with near-perfect timing so as to avoid either fouling or simply sending the ball out of bounds. He still ends up on the wrong end of the referee’s whistle often enough, but for a physical, young defender, his 3.5 fouls per 36 are reasonably close to [players who emulate his style.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&sum=0&player_id1_hint=David+Nwaba&player_id1_select=David+Nwaba&player_id1=nwabada01&y1=2018&player_id2_hint=Eric+Bledsoe&player_id2_select=Eric+Bledsoe&y2=2018&player_id2=bledser01&idx=players&player_id3_hint=Marcus+Smart&player_id3_select=Marcus+Smart&y3=2018&player_id3=smartma01&idx=players&player_id4_hint=Andre+Roberson&player_id4_select=Andre+Roberson&y4=2018&player_id4=roberan03&idx=players&player_id5_hint=P.J.+Tucker&player_id5_select=P.J.+Tucker&y5=2018&player_id5=tuckepj01&idx=players&player_id6_hint=Jerami+Grant&player_id6_select=Jerami+Grant&y6=2018&player_id6=grantje01&idx=players)

Yes, Nwaba does lead the category, but only marginally. His contributions on the glass, passing lanes, and at the rim are certainly in a similar class to these defenders. He plays physical and this is his first full year in the league. There are bound to be foul struggles.

It’s not like Nwaba is a particularly cerebral defender, ala Andre Iguodala or Shane Battier; he’s not going to force his matchup into their low-percentage areas. Instead, he turns crossing halfcourt into a hassle, each pass a risky endeavor. That’s the role that high-intensity defenders like the ones listed above embrace: making life as difficult as possible on every possession.

On offense, Nwaba is similarly blue-collar. Hoiberg’s offense has never, and likely will never, call for a pindown screen to free Nwaba for a pull-up three. The schemes involving him are tremendously simple, but they are also tremendously effective. Most often is when Nwaba secures the offensive rebound and then zips upcourt with the ball, forcing the defense to rush into sets and mark Bulls players quickly, which obviously increases the odds of mismatches or poor coverage.

Hoiberg recently told Chicago Tribune reporter K.C. Johnson that they have named this set “The Locomotive Package” and there’s hardly a more apt description; Nwaba’s athleticism, which was highlighted in the defensive coverage, is equally devastating [here.](https://gfycat.com/AmpleEthicalIberianemeraldlizard)

While the beginning of the clip is unfortunately cut off, the above action is perhaps the most straightforward version of the Locomotive Package. Nwaba secures the rebound amid a sea of bodies and immediately turns up-court. Zipser is streaking down the center, which is just enough to draw Courtney Lee away from Nwaba, who blows by Lance Thomas and gets a simple, no-frills layup. His fluid athleticism is on full display here, as his sneakily long strides get him gliding past Thomas and up to the rim faster than the small forward can react.

Alternatively, Nwaba can find another teammate for an easy look, as his own speed typically draws more than one defender. That’s the case with [Cristiano Felicio](https://gfycat.com/KlutzyRightGreatargus), who hustles harder than a man his size has a right to and receives the dump-off assist as a reward.

What you see [in the video here](https://gfycat.com/EmbellishedAngryCrow) is the Locomotive Package, but with a slight wrinkle. Nwaba doesn’t have a straight shot to the rim, which is where he excels, so he slips in front of Jerian Grant and drops off the ball for the PG to initiate the offense. Nwaba is a sound “simple passer” in that he can make the obvious read and complete the pass with Tim Duncan-level flair. Asking him to run the whole offense simply isn’t realistic yet. Instead, this set has Nwaba do what he does best (rebound, run, attack) while still allowing for some quick half-court actions if the lane is closed off to him. The defense is still forced to quickly adjust, but now Chicago’s primary playmaker on the floor is equipped to take advantage while they find their men.

As Nwaba gets more opportunities with Justin Holiday’s minutes reduction, he’ll be asked to do more. That was apparent against Philadelphia, where Nwaba scored a career-high 21 points doing some of the things he always does, along with one of the things he doesn’t: three-point shooting. It’s a minuscule sample size (his three makes are almost a third of his season total), but for a career slasher to shoot confidently and make all his attempts, it’s at least a promising sign. See here how the [Bulls punish the sagging Philadelphia defenders.](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/MeatySnarlingElephantseal-mobile.mp4)

No one will ever ask Nwaba to shoot as well as JJ Redick (coincidentally his defender in this sequence), but he doesn’t have to. The threat of a Nwaba drive will make defenders hesitant to choke up on him outside the arc. Having enough shooting ability to make them occasionally regret that decision will be sufficient. He’s shooting 40% from deep this year on a paltry 25 attempts, but that is roughly double his takes and efficiency from the year before (a single make over his five attempts from three). Hoiberg has worked wonders for Kris Dunn’s shooting motion. There’s no reason to think he can’t do the same for Nwaba now.

The 76ers game also showed Nwaba’s propensity for finding the baseline path to the hoop. Whether he was beating Ben Simmons off the dribble or cutting for a Zach LaVine assist, Nwaba was reminiscent of a former Bull from the Bench Mob days: Ronnie Brewer. Brewer’s offense was basically that of a 6’8 Nwaba: non-shooter, best at the rim, and thrived off of well-timed cuts and dives in Thibodeau’s otherwise-stagnant offensive planning. That movement keeps defenses honest and will make teams hesitant to double LaVine on the drive, lest they surrender a wide-open dunk to Nwaba.

This may be an unorthodox observation, but still one worth mentioning. Nwaba always seems aware of the smaller aspects of the game, like when he literally saved Kris Dunn’s career against the 76ers. Dunn had just returned from a serious faceplant (resulting in a concussion and dislocated teeth) against the Warriors and was due for another one after tumbling over Ben Simmons. [Instead…](https://twitter.com/12upSport/status/966847085659152385)

It may seem a silly thing to be talking about a weird and isolated event with so few on-court consequences, but from a different angle, it’s just another indicator of Nwaba’s constant awareness to things that otherwise might not be reacted to.

Constant vigilance and cat-like reflexes used to save those in harm’s way? The superhero comparisons write themselves. Nwaba will continue to fight and claw his way into a longterm position in the NBA, and how he adapts to the increased burden of expectation will be an exciting thing to watch.","I wrote an OC on Nwaba's contributions, would love some feedback! ###Disclaimer: This was written as a non-Reddit piece, so it's a little long and has some intro stuff for less-tuned-in Chicago fans.

"*Sorry about missing yesterday. I would have told one of the people who offered to help out if I couldn't do it one day, but I was expecting to be able to and just could't get the time to even do a short one until really late. Today's I'll edit with summaries in the afternoon when I have more time.

There were 3 tank wins in the last two days, opening the door for us to make some more progress if we can get another losing streak going. In general the tanks have been playing better lately, though a lot of them still lose it in the end.

Today there are 4 tanks playing including us. All of them have tough games against playoff teams, so it's unlikely we'll make any progress in this one. Plenty of games that could impact the Pelicans pick also.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Saturday's Results**

&amp;nbsp;

Grizzlies(18-43) 100

Magic (19-43) 107

Grizzlies look like they will be a top 3 tank, losing their 12th in a row now. Much better for us that the Magic won, who we definitely have a shot at passing in the lottery standings. 

**Good for tank**

&amp;nbsp;

Nuggets (34-28) 126

Cavaliers(36-25) 117

Nuggets are still just 1.5 games behind the Pelicans. If the Pels regress before the end of the season Nuggets are a good bet to pass them. Cavs are tied with the Pelicans now, we should hope for them to win some games now to get back ahead of the Pelicans. Nuggets are more important though, being in the same conference.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&amp;nbsp;

Pistons(29-33) 96

Heat (32-30) 105

Pelicans won't be falling below the Heat or Pistons so this game doesn't affect the Bulls at all. Heat cementing their playoff spot a little more by winning here.

**Not likely to affect either pick**

&amp;nbsp;

Celtics (44-19) 120

Rockets(48-13) 123

Pelicans won't catch either of these teams so nothing here that affects the Bulls. Rockets win their 15th in row though, damn are they hot.

**Not likely to affect either pick**

&amp;nbsp;

Lakers(27-34) 116

Spurs (36-26) 112

Lakers continue to beat every team that could help our draft picks, they have been really annoying lately. Spurs just can't string any wins together. They appeared to have the 3rd or 4th seed locked up at the break but they're in danger of falling out of the playoffs now. They need to figure their shit out and pass the Pelicans back.

**Bad for Pelican's pick**

&amp;nbsp;

Thunder(37-27) 100

Blazers (36-26) 108

Blazers have a better chance of staying ahead of the Pelicans, though either win would have been good since they were tied. Blazers are now the only team able to stay ahead of the Pelicans in the East or West (not including the top 4 teams). Both teams need to win a lot the rest of the season though. 

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&amp;nbsp;

Jazz (34-30) 98

Kings(19-43) 91

Kings played pretty well, I'm still optimistic they can win enough to pass us. Jazz stay in the West playoff hunt, still can't gain much ground with the Nuggets and Clippers playing well.

**Bad for tank, Good for Pelican's pick**

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&amp;nbsp;

Suns (19-46) 112

Hawks(20-44) 113

Didn't see any of the game, but glad the Hawks won. Suns look like a bottom 3 lock, but the Hawks have had some promising games lately. We are just 2 games back of the Hawks now, very doable.

**Good for tank**

&amp;nbsp;

Hornets (28-36) 98

Raptors (45-17) 103

Doesn't really matter for the Bulls, less likely the Hornets make the playoffs now though, losing another game to the Heat with their last win.

**Doesn't affect either pick**

&amp;nbsp;

Pacers (36-27) 98

Wizards(36-28) 95

Pacers take a slight lead on the Wizards in the East, both teams need to win more games to catch the Pelicans and give us a better pick.

**Neutral for Pelicans pick**

&amp;nbsp;

Pelicans (36-26) 126

Mavericks(19-45) 109

Didn't expect too much here, but a Mavs win would have been awesome. Pelicans have almost maxed out their draft spot for what is realistically possible. Mavericks are 3 games away from us now, it's gonna take quite a few wins from them for us to catch them now.

**Bad for tank, Bad for Pelicans pick**

&amp;nbsp;

76ers (34-28) 116

Bucks (34-29) 112

Both team would ideally pass the Pelicans, but not sure if the Bucks will now with how cold they've been. 76ers are hot and moving up in the East, they could catch the Pels if they keep playing well.

**Neutral for Pelican's pick**

&amp;nbsp;

Nets (20-44) 120

Clips (34-28) 123

Nets somehow lose this one, even with a fairly big 4th quarter lead. I'd say it was a masterful tank job if they were a tank but they just suck. Would have been a big game to gain on the Nets, but Clippers can help us too if they keep winning and pass the Pelicans.

**Bad for tank, Good for Pelicans pick**

&amp;nbsp;

Knicks(24-40) 99

Kings (20-44) 102

Good upset for the Kings. Knicks gain a little on us but they shouldn't be a problem unless we start winning a lot. Kings are now just 2 games ahead of us, very catchable with how we're playing.

**Good for tank**

"Seeing as Rose has minimal options and the Bulls will obviously become a finals contender within the next few years🤞😉, I say we go ahead and bring Derrick back home. It’s obvious he’d be passionate about the city and fans, and while he may not lead the team as he once did, I feel like he’d be a great mentor to our young players.

"Winning yesterday pretty much threw away all of the progress we'd made since the all-star break. A loss would have put us just one game away from a top 5 pick, but instead we are back to 3 games from the top spot and over a game away from the next closest team. Magic managed a win so that's good, and most of the teams competing with the Pelicans won too. Could have been another pretty good day if we didn't win.

Today has another tank on tank battle, so that's a little closer we will get to at least one. A few games have relevance to the Pelicans pick too, but not a huge day for us.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Pistons(29-33) 106

Magic (19-43) 115

Magic played another good game and finally came out with a win, Aaron Gordon was really good for them. They had the lottery lead before the win, but now they are in the 6th spot. They are still just 2 games away from us and playing well so we can definitely catch them still.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Hornets(28-35) 99

76ers (34-27) 110

76ers are moving up in the playoffs, now just 2 games away from the 3 seed. They are also just 1 game behind the Pelicans which is good for us. 

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Warriors(49-14) 114

Hawks (19-44) 109

Hawks played the Warriors close for the whole game and even had a chance to send it to OT before the turned it over. A win here would have been awesome, but considering it was agains the Warriors, this game has to be taken as an overall positive.

**Bad (but promising) for tank**

&nbsp;

Raptors (44-17) 102

Wizards (36-27) 95

Wizards are now tied with the Pelicans, they are just 5-5 in their last 10 games. They could be slipping down in the playoffs soon if they don't pick their game up.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Mavs (19-44) 100

Bulls (21-41) 108

We were trailing for the whole damn game before we ended the game with a 28-9. Things looked very promising until the Mavericks conveniently forgot how to score in the 4th quarter and we were making almost every shot we took. This is a huge blow to our tank. We were finally about to improve our lottery spot after a long time of losing, but now we are right back to the spot we had before the break.

On the bright side, Dunn looked much better today, especially his 3, hitting 3 of the 4 he took. Lauri had another good game as well, also shooting better from 3 than he had lately. Portis keeps his hot streak going as well. 

We are going to need to start another losing streak right away and keep this one going even longer. In our next 8 games we play 4 tanks, and we can't afford to win too many more of those games. The other tanks have been playing better lately, so hopefully it won't tank so long for the Bulls to catch them now. If we can just lose enough to secure a top 5 spot it would do wonders for our lottery chances and draft opportunities.

**Very bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Nuggets (34-28) 108

Grizzlies (18-43) 102

Grizzlies played a good team pretty close, which is the best sign they've showed in forever. I'm starting to think they might actually end up with the top lottery spot with how consistently bad they've been. Nuggets stay just 1.5 games behind the Pelicans, so they can still pass them in the West

**Bad for tank, good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Pacers(35-27) 103

Bucks (33-29) 96

Bucks fall short of what the Mavericks and Hawks could do, unable to top the Pacers. This is good for the Bulls because the Pacers are closer to the Pelicans and should be able to keep pace with them now. Bucks I was also hoping could pass the Pelicans, but they don't look like they are passing anyone right now.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Thunder(37-27) 124

Suns (19-45) 116

Suns lead for most of the game, actually led by double digits in the 3rd quarter before losing in the end. Even compared to the other tanks, they seem especially good at losing games in which they have a good lead. Suns take sole lead of the lottery lead back with this one. Thunder take a 0.5 game lead on the Pelicans, but with how bad they've played agains the worst teams in the league, i doubt they keep winning for long. 

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Wolves(38-28) 108

Jazz (32-30) 116

With this game, the West has now turned into a 4 way tie for the 3 seed. The Timberwolves, Thunder, Spurs, and Trail Blazers are all just 0.5 games ahead of the Pelicans. We don't know how long the Pelicans are going to keep winning for, so we need all these teams to keep winning as much as possible to keep the Pelicans down. Jazz could still catch the Pelicans if the Pels ever decide to start losing. Jazz are 3.5 back but playing really well.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Knicks (24-39) 105

Clippers(33-28) 128

Clippers keep up their pressure on the West playoffs, they are just 0.5 games out of a playoff spot and 2 games back of the Pelicans. Knicks gain a game on us tonight, they are now just 2.5 games behind us. That is a little too close for comfort, especially with the other tanks we're playing soon.

**Bad for tank, good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (18-43) vs Magic (19-43) 

Spread: Magic -7.5

We'll gain on one of these teams at the very least today. Grizzlies look terrible and I'm losing faith that we can catch them. Magic on the other hand look like one of the better teams at the bottom right now. Magic can pass us soon if they win this and then keep up their good play to steal a few more wins.

**Go Magic!**

&nbsp;

Nuggets (34-28) vs Cavaliers (36-25)

Spread: Cavaliers -5.0

We want the Cavs to do well if the Pelicans stay in the playoffs. We want the Nuggets to do well no matter what the Pelicans do, so they get the edge. Both teams are playing pretty well lately but with a couple of slips ups. Nuggets will have it tough playing on the road after a game last night.

**Go Nuggets!**

&nbsp;

Pistons (29-33) vs Heat (32-30)

Spread: Heat -5.0

This game doesn't really matter because neither of these teams will be finishing with a better record than the Pelicans, nor a worse record than the Bulls. Heat have a slightly better chance of passing the Pels but you can just take your pick here.

**Go Heat!**

&nbsp;

Celtics (44-19) vs Rockets (48-13)

Spread: Rockets -8.5

This game doesn't affect the Bulls picks at all. The Bulls next game is against the Celtics though, so the best thing would be a blowout for the Celtics so their starters get plenty of rest. Definitely hope for no OT.

**Go Celtics**

&nbsp;

Lakers (27-34) vs Spurs (36-26) 

Spread: Spurs -4.0

Spurs have not been very good lately, losing 7 of their last 10 games to lose their firm hold on the 3 seed. They need to turn it around quick if they are going to stay ahead of the Pelicans in the playoffs. Lakers have been hot lately so it won't be an easy game for them.

**Go Spurs!**

&nbsp;

Thunder (37-27) vs Trail Blazers (36-26)

Spread: Trial Blazers -4.0

Both teams are tied for the 3 seed in the West, just 0.5 ahead of the Pelicans. We need both teams to win as much as possible but only one can here. I think the Blazers are the better team and will finish ahead of the Thunder in the end, so I would rather have Portland win and get a firmer grasp on the 3-4 seed. Either way is good for us though.

**Both teams are even, take your pick**

&nbsp;

Jazz (34-30) vs Kings (19-43)

Spread: Jazz -6.5

Kings are playing a little better lately but Jazz will be tough to beat. They aren't as hot as they were when they won 11 straight, but they've still been very good. Kings are just 2 games ahead of us, could be a candidate to pass us soon if they can win this one.

**Go Kings!**

"Bulls players going forward
From a long-time Bulls fan who actually watches the games. Let me know what you think. 

Lauri Markkanen

Everything you read about Markkanen is true. What really strikes you when you watch him over a period of time is his maturity. He has a calmness and smoothness to his game that you would expect to see in an older, smaller player. As crazy as it sounds, Kevin Durant is a fair comparison. The important thing to remember during the offseason, when the inevitable backlash starts because his numbers aren’t stellar, is that he is hitting the rookie wall HARD. His legs are heavy, so he’s not converting at the rim. In the future, when games matter and he’s in better shape, expect Markkanen to show up in big games and carry the Bulls in crunch time. He has no major holes in his offensive game, so it’s not like other teams are going to “figure him out.” Although he may not be a monster on defense, he’s a savvy player who can get up and block shots. Because he’s not a ballhog I don’t expect him to become an all-star starter, but you want him on your team. 

Kris Dunn

I can’t say enough about how much I love his game. On defense he has the size, athleticism and doggedness to make life difficult for opposing point guards. On offense he can get to the rim and finish, but he has a point guard’s mentality so he also looks to pass if it’s the right play. He is not a volume scorer, but he has a nice stroke and converts open threes. I hope I get to watch him for a decade. Credit the Bulls management for getting him in the Butler trade. 

Zach Levine

Assume athletic ability and skills. I would trade him as soon as I had a decent offer. If you’re the type of fan who focuses on highlights then you might think he’s an elite player. But if you watch him carefully over a long period of time, something doesn’t feel right. He just doesn’t seem to understand the game. I get a similar feeling watching Westbrook in that their decision-making seems preordained. Both players have the ability to pop off for 40 when they’ve got it going, but even on those days they seem to play with blinders on. They’ll pass from time to time because they feel they should rather than because it’s the right basketball play. The hope is that in time he will learn to play within a system. I wouldn’t wait. I’d move him for a smarter wing player (or two) who fits with Dunn and Markkanen. 

Robin Lopez

Dude is an absolute oak tree in the middle. Nobody can push him off his spot in the post. He has a surprisingly good shot up to about 18 feet and can finish in the low post over both shoulders. I’ve lost count of the number of games I’ve seen him go 6 for 7, 7 of 9. For a big he’s been remarkably healthy over the years. It’s true that he’s slow and doesn’t jump much, but he’s smart and moves his feet enough that he’s not a liability. In the modern game, he’s the center you start so that your star big (ie, Markkanen) doesn’t have to bang with the other team’s lug. I’d welcome him long-term, but the Bulls signed Felicio to a long-term deal, so Lopez is probably on his way out. Shame. 

Bobby Portis

Good ol’ crazy eyes Portis. Dude brings it every night. He’s a perfect stretch 4 in the modern game who can finish at the rim or spot up outside. He often finishes the game at center. The market will probably determine whether or not the Bulls hang on to him. 

Crisiano Felicio

I saw him make a jumper from about 20 feet last week. No really. Other than that, every score for him is off a roll to the hoop in the pick and roll. He’s agile, strong and active. He knows his roll and plays within it. Going forward he has 3 years 24 million on his contract, which you can view as untradeable or filler in a trade for an expensive star to make salaries match. I would much rather have Lopez as my starter, but a lot depends on how you want to play. Felicio has a good motor and can get you 12 points a night. 

David Nwaba

One of the most active players I’ve ever seen, this guy just makes things happen. His athleticism is off the charts, like he’s just one enormous fast-twitch muscle. His outside shot is the obvious weakness, but it seems to be coming around. Don’t be surprised if he ends up starting at the 3. He reminds me of a young Wes Matthews. 

And that’s about it in terms of valuable NBA rotation players on the Bulls’ roster. Valentine and Zipser are both good shooters who can’t finish – at all – at the rim. Payne is a spaz who just doesn’t seem to understand the NBA game. Grant might be a back-up point, a 10th man who will likely bounce around the league for a few more years.

"Light day yesterday, but we ended up gaining on another one of the tank leaders with the Kings win. Trail Blazers kept pace with the Pelicans again so thats good too.

Today is much more important, with 7 different tanks playing, including us. We can move just 0.5 games behind the Mavericks with a loss to them. The other tanks have some pretty tough games though so it's not very likely we gain much more. We could lose all the ground we've gained with a loss though, so It's a very risky night too.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Lakers(26-34) 131

Heat (32-29) 113

The Heat are pretty unlikely to catch the Pelicans now, but a win would have put them possibly within reach at 2.5 games. Now 3.5 back and losing to non-playoff teams, It's hard to see the Heat passing the Pelicans now.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

76ers(32-27) 108

Cavs (36-24) 97

76ers led for the whole game, but it was pretty close throughout. 76ers are still just 1.5 games behind the Pelicans to help our draft spot, but the Cavs are just 1 game ahead of the Pelicans. Both teams winning would be good to improve that pick.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Nets (20-42) 111

Kings(18-43) 116

There were some clutch shots to force OT before the Kings took the game. The best thing about the game was that both teams looked pretty damn good down the stretch. It could be just because they were playing against each other, but if they keep playing that well I think they could get some more wins soon. 

A Nets win would have tied us up with them, but the Kings win is another tank leader getting closer to us. Bulls are just 1.5 games back of 4 different teams now, we could start finally passing teams soon if we keep losing.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Timberwolves(38-26) 99

Trail Blazers (35-26) 108

Pretty even game throughout until the Blazers took over in the 4th. Trail Blazers are on a 5 game win streak now to stay slightly ahead of the Pelicans for now. It's just 0.5 games still, so we need the Pelicans to start losing before the other teams can't keep up. Minnesota is just 1 game ahead of the Pelicans for the 3 seed now.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Pistons (29-32) vs Magic (18-43) 

Spread: Pistons -2.5

This is a very good chance for the Magic to finally get a win. They have been playing pretty good teams very close for a while now, and can definitely beat the Pistons with another good game. They currently have the lottery lead, but a win paired with a Bulls loss would put us just one game behind them.

**Go Magic!**

&nbsp;

Hornets (28-34) vs 76ers (33-27)

Spread: 76ers -3.5

76ers could get within 1 game of the Pelicans with a win tonight. Playoff wise they could also move ahead of the Pacers for the 5th seed tonight. 

**Go 76ers!**

&nbsp;

Warriors (48-14) vs Hawks (19-43)

Spread: Warriors -12.5

Hawks did just beat a playoff team the other day, but no way they beat the Warriors while they are still playing for something. Hawks playing a close game would be good enough for this one.

**Go Hawks!**

&nbsp;

Raptors (43-17) vs Wizards (36-26)

Spread: Raptors -2.5

Raptors are playing really well right now to keep the lead in the East. We need the Wizards to keep winning to stay ahead of the Pelicans though, they are only ahead by 0.5 games.

**Go Wizards!**

&nbsp;

Mavericks (19-43) vs Bulls (20-41) 

Spread: Mavericks -1.0

Another huge game for the Bulls tonight. A loss would put us even closer to at least one tank team. A win could lose a game to every other team. Right now every other team is within reach of us, we just need to really extend this losing streak as long as we can.

Mavericks have been playing very well lately. After beating the Pacers, they took the Thunder to OT before losing. They really need to keep that good play up against the Bulls. Our defense and turnovers have been pretty bad lately, but different players have had good games at different times. Let's hope that Dunn can bounce back with a better game, along with good games from Lauri and Lavine. Felicio can hopefully tank our starters enough until Payne can take over with our bench guys. 

**Go Mavericks!**

&nbsp;

Nuggets (33-28) vs Grizzlies (18-42)

Spread: No line yet (will update)

Grizzlies somehow lost to the Suns, so I'm a little more pessimistic about their chances of ever winning again. They are just 1.5 games ahead of us though so if they can manage just one win before our losing streak stops they could be catchable. Nuggets win would be good for us too, considering they need to catch back up to the Pelicans, 2 games back now.

**Go Grizzlies!**

&nbsp;

Pacers (34-27) vs Bucks (33-28)

Spread: No line yet

Pacers are 1 game behind the Pelicans and the Bucks are 2. Both are good teams and can catch back up, but they are also both playing bad lately. Pacers get the edge because they are closer to the Pels, and because I'm still thanking them for the two tank losses.

**Go Pacers!**

&nbsp;

Thunder (36-27) vs Suns (19-44)

Spread: No line yet

Thunder are somehow playing only tanks since the all-star break. They have been annoyingly close to losing a lot of those games, but they always come out on top in the end. Suns just beat the Grizzlies so hopefully they bring that momentum in to win this one. Thunder win is good too, they are still tied with the Pelicans in the West.

**Go Suns!**

&nbsp;

Timberwolves (38-27) vs Jazz (31-30) 

Spread: Jazz -6.5

Timberwolves are just one game ahead of the Pelicans in the West and need to stay ahead of them. Jazz are 4 games behind the Pelicans, but with how well they've played lately, I'm not giving up on them yet. Timberwolves get the edge being closer to the Pels though.

**Go Timberwolves!**

&nbsp;

Knicks (24-38) vs Clippers (32-28)

Spread: Clippers -9.0

Knicks are now 3.5 games behind the Bulls in the lottery, but that's not quite enough space to be comfortable yet. Clippers are just 2.5 games behind the Pelicans. Either result can benefit us, but our pick has priority.

**Go Knicks!**

&nbsp;

"Another good day for the tank yesterday. Two more tanks got wins, moving the Bulls up to just 2 games back from the lottery lead. Pelicans won and the other games didn't really go our way, but any day that features two tanks winning is a good day for the Bulls.

Just four games today, but it features another two tanks against each other (Nets vs Kings) so that's at least one more win for a tank. 

Might be some typos had to rush this

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Bucks (33-27) 87

Pistons(28-32) 110

Bucks stay weirdly inconsistent this year, fall behind the Pelicans a little further.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Raptors(42-17) 117

Magic (18-43) 104

Magic actually played pretty well, kept it very close until later in the 4th. Them playing well again is a good sign from this one

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Pacers (34-26) 102

Hawks (18-43) 107

Everyone should take some time today to thank the Pacers. They are a solid playoff team that just lost to two tanks in a row to help us out a lot. Hawks are just 1.5 ahead of the Bulls now.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Hornets(28-33) 106

Celtics (43-19) 134

This didn't matter too much, Pelicans won't catch the Celtics or fall all the way to the Hornets.

**Neutral for tank**

&nbsp;

Warriors(47-14) 109

Wizards (36-25) 101

Tough game for the Wizards, against Warriors looking to get home court in the playoffs back. They are still ahead of the Pelicans record and we need it to stay that way

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Suns(18-44) 105

Griz (18-41) 92

Either result would have been good for us here. Suns loss makes us just 2 games back from the lottery lead now. Grizzlies win would have been good to put us just 0.5 games back from them but any tank win is a win for us.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Thunder (35-27) 111

Mavericks(19-42) 110

Really big shame the Mavericks couldn't hold on for the win. They played really well until giving up the lead late in the 4th. It's a good sign they played well though, hopefully they can carry that into their game against us Friday. Thunder keep pace with the Pelicans so that's a positive out of this game.

**Bad for tank, good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Pelicans(34-26) 121

Spurs (36-25) 116

Pelicans keep winning, just 0.5 games from passing the Spurs now. Davis didn't have his insane stats, but he played really well again and was the reason they took and kept the lead in the 4th. Their pick is now in the 20's and they could get as high as 26 before the season is over. They have a tough schedule coming up, but they also look pretty damn unstoppable right now.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Rockets (47-13) 105

Clippers (31-27) 92

Clippers had a tough game and they slip back out of the playoffs. They need to get back to winning now to get back in and maybe pass the Pelicans when they fall back to each.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Lakers (26-34) vs Heat (32-29) 

Spread: Heat -4.5

Neither teams will likely matter for either pick. Heat are a slightly better chance to affect things by passing the Pelicans but that doesn't look very possible so honestly just take your pick.

**Go Heat!**

&nbsp;

76ers (32-27) vs Cavaliers (36-24)

Spread: Cavaliers -2.5

Both teams we hope will end up ahead of the Pelicans, Cavs get the edge being closer the Pelicans right now.

**Go Cavaliers!**

&nbsp;

Nets (20-42) vs Kings (18-43)

Spread: Nets -2.5

Both outcomes would be good for us, I'd rather have the Nets win and then get safely behind us in the lottery race over the next few weeks. Kings win is always a good thing too though.

**Go Nets!**

&nbsp;

Timberwolves (38-26) vs Trail Blazers (35-26)

Spread: Trail Blazers -5.0

We need both teams to win the rest of the year but Blazers get the edge since they are closer (tied) to the Pelicans.

**Go Trail Blazers!**

* Bulls pick is currently at 8 and we are 2 games back of the top spot. 

* Bulls are just 0.5 games behind the Nets for the 7th spot, and 1.5 games behind the Mavericks and Hawks for the 5th spot

* Pelicans are tied for the 20th spot in the draft, 2.5 games from slipping out of the playoffs and 1.5 games from the 5th best record in the league","Tank Watch: March 1st, 2018 Another good day for the tank yesterday. Two more tanks got wins, moving the Bulls up to just 2 games back from the lottery lead. Pelicans won and the other games didn't really go our way, but any day that features two tanks winning is a good day for the Bulls.

Just four games today, but it features another two tanks against each other (Nets vs Kings) so that's at least one more win for a tank. 

Might be some typos had to rush this

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Bucks (33-27) 87

Pistons(28-32) 110

Bucks stay weirdly inconsistent this year, fall behind the Pelicans a little further.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Raptors(42-17) 117

Magic (18-43) 104

Magic actually played pretty well, kept it very close until later in the 4th. Them playing well again is a good sign from this one

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Pacers (34-26) 102

Hawks (18-43) 107

Everyone should take some time today to thank the Pacers. They are a solid playoff team that just lost to two tanks in a row to help us out a lot. Hawks are just 1.5 ahead of the Bulls now.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Hornets(28-33) 106

Celtics (43-19) 134

This didn't matter too much, Pelicans won't catch the Celtics or fall all the way to the Hornets.

**Neutral for tank**

&nbsp;

Warriors(47-14) 109

Wizards (36-25) 101

Tough game for the Wizards, against Warriors looking to get home court in the playoffs back. They are still ahead of the Pelicans record and we need it to stay that way

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Suns(18-44) 105

Griz (18-41) 92

Either result would have been good for us here. Suns loss makes us just 2 games back from the lottery lead now. Grizzlies win would have been good to put us just 0.5 games back from them but any tank win is a win for us.

"The Bulls still only have the [8th-worst record in the league](http://www.tankathon.com/), but four teams below them have shown weakness recently by winning games.  The Nets beat the Bulls, the Hawks beat the Pacers, the Mavs beat the Pacers (thanks, Pacers), and the Suns beat the Grizzlies.

The bad news is that Anthony Davis has dragged the Pelicans to a 7-game winning streak, so the Pelicans' first round draft pick getting farther and farther from the lottery.  I'm torn because what the Pelicans have done without Boogie is amazing, and I still like a lot of the players on that team.  But there's no question this hurts the Bulls.

"Pretty good day for the tank. Bulls keep the pressure on the other tanks with their 5th straight loss. Nets and Kings lost too, but those were some tough opponents who they played close. 

Today we have another Pelicans game, 5 different tanks playing, and a few games that could affect the Pelicans pick too. Both today and tomorrow have games in which two tanks play each other, so that's some guaranteed wins for two of the teams we are chasing.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Bulls (20-40) 103

Hornets(27-33) 118

Another big loss for the Bulls, we caught the Hornets at the right time because they look good over their 5 game win streak. We get another chance to gain a game on some tanks with a lot of them playing tomorrow. It will continue to be a slow process catching the other tanks, but if we keep losing we can improve our draft prospects a lot.

Lauri shot well again but only got 11 points, we need to get him some more looks. Dunn did not look very good though, he needs to get some more consistency the rest of the way. Felicio was surprisingly good at shooting, though he made up for it by being responsible for several turnovers. 

The Bulls play 5 tanks in our next 9 games so this is the most important stretch of the year. If we could lose all of those tank games we would suddenly be looking at a top 5 lottery spot with opportunity to get even higher. 

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Nets (20-41) 123

Cavs (35-24) 129

Nets played a very very good game and would have come out with a win if not for some damn impressive shots by the Cavaliers in the last few minutes. Nets hung around all game, coming back every time Cavs looked like they would make a run. They were up in the last minute, but Cavs just kept making shots. I didn't expect a win to begin with, so seeing the Nets play this well was a very good sign. It's really too bad they couldn't pull out the win, but if they keep up this kind of play they will be winning a lot more for the rest of the season.

**Bad (but promising) for tank**

&nbsp;

76ers(32-26) 101

Heat (31-29) 102

76ers led for almost the the whole second half, but Wade hopped in a time machine and took over in the 4th quarter. 76ers win would have been much better for us, with them being closer to passing the Pelicans. We'll need them to pick it up now if they are going to do that.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Wizards(35-25) 107

Bucks (33-26) 105

Bucks were down huge the whole first half. They battled back to make it very close in the end, but they never actually led the whole game. Both teams need to win a lot to stay ahead of the Pelicans, didn't matter too much who won this one. Bucks need to pick it up though, they are just 1.5 games from slipping into the 8 seed.

**Neutral for tank**

&nbsp;

Kings (18-42) 99

Blazers(34-26) 116

The Kings played better than the score makes it seem. They never led, but they came back from a big deficit and kept it very close for a long time in the second half. They fell apart later in the 4th though, which they seem to do almost every game. We are just 2 games behind the Kings now, and they have some winnable games soon so passing them is still possible. Trail Blazers get a good win to keep ahead of the Pelicans, so we do get some benefit from this game.

**Bad for tank, good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Clippers (31-27) 122

Nuggets (33-27) 120

Come from behind win for the hot Clippers finally puts them into a playoff spot. They are tied for the 8 seed with the Nuggets, but have the better winning percentage. The Nuggets led by 19 late in the 3rd quarter, but the Clippers went on a 18-6 run for the rest of the quarter, and they kept that up in the 4th to take the lead. Nuggets battled back but couldn't win it in the end. We want both of these teams to pass the Pelicans, so either result would have been pretty good. Nuggets would have been a little better because they would have been just 0.5 behind the Pelicans, but now both Clippers and Nuggets are 1.5 games behind them. 

**Neutral/slightly bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Bucks (33-27) vs Pistons (28-32) 

Spread: Pistons -1.5

Both teams are not playing their best right now. Pistons aren't a realistic possibility to catch the Pelicans anymore, Bucks are only a game behind the Pelicans so they are the team to root for. 

**Go Bucks!**

&nbsp;

Raptors (42-17) vs Magic (18-43)

Spread: Raptors -9.0

Hard to imagine the Magic beating the Raptors. Magic are on a 6 game losing streak, but they haven't been that bad during the skid, only losing by an average of 6.3 points. If they show up and play the Raptors tough that'll be good enough for me. We are just 1.5 games behind them, so all they need is just a few upsets and we pass them.

**Go Magic!**

&nbsp;

Pacers (34-26) vs Hawks (18-43)

Spread: Pacers -5.0

Hawks look really really bad lately, but the Pacers did just lose to the Mavericks the other day so who knows. Hawks are ahead of us by 2 games, very catchable if they get an upset tonight. 

**Go Hawks!**

&nbsp;

Hornets (28-33) vs Celtics (43-19)

Spread: Celtics -7.5

Hornets are hot but Celtics will be tough to beat. Neither team will likely affect either of our picks, but the Hornets have a slightly better chance of affecting the Pelicans pick (but pretty much only if they win out). This one's pretty irrelevant to us though.

**Go Hornets!**

&nbsp;

Warriors (47-14) vs Wizards (36-25)

Spread: Warriors -9.0

Both teams are playing well lately, Wizards need to keep winning to stay ahead of the Pelicans, just 1.5 games ahead of them right now. It'll be tough playing the Warriors after a close game yesterday though. 

**Go Wizards!**

&nbsp;

Suns (18-44) vs Grizzlies (18-41)

Spread: Grizzlies -1.5

Every day the other tanks keep losing so we can never gain any games on them. One of these teams has to win though, so today we are gaining a game on one of them. Suns win and we are only 2 games back of the lottery lead, Grizzlies win and we are just 1 game from passing them. I would rather have the Grizzlies win this one. The Suns are the team I think we are least likely to pass, whereas the Grizzlies are much more likely. Both tanks will be putting their 10 game losing streaks to the test, but either way this game helps the tank.

**Go Grizzlies!**

&nbsp;

Thunder (35-27) vs Mavericks (19-42)

Spread: Thunder -5.0

Thunder have come dangerously close to losing to a couple other tanks lately, hopefully this will be the day they do. Mavericks are coming off of a big upset win over the Pacers, another win here would put the Bulls back only 0.5 games. The next game for the Mavericks after this is against the Bulls, so a win (or at least a good showing) could give them some momentum to beat us. A Thunder win isn't bad either, with them still tied with the Pelicans.

**Go Mavericks!**

&nbsp;

Pelicans (34-26) vs Spurs (36-25)

Spread: Spurs -4.5

The Pelicans are one of the hottest teams in the league, but this is the toughest game for them in a while. Spurs will likely have a better plan to at least slow down Davis. This is very big for the Pelicans pick, because a Pelicans win would put them 0.5 games behind the Spurs. On the other hand a Spurs win would put them back up to 2.5 ahead of the Pelicans, and more importantly break the Pels winning streak.

**Go Spurs!**

&nbsp;

Rockets (47-13) vs Clippers (31-27)

Spread: Rockets -8.0

Clippers have been playing well for a long time and finally forced their way into the playoffs. They'll be met by the best and hottest team in the NBA, Rockets are currently on a 13 game win streak. Clippers are only 1.5 games behind the Pelicans now, we need them to keep winning and pass them up in the West.

**Go Clippers!**

We get another chance to gain a game on some tanks with a lot of them playing tomorrow. It will continue to be a slow process catching the other tanks, but if we keep losing we can improve our draft prospects a lot.

Lauri shot well again but only got 11 points, we need to get him some more looks. Dunn did not look very good though, he needs to get some more consistency the rest of the way. Felicio was surprisingly good at shooting, though he made up for it by being responsible for several turnovers. 

The Bulls play 5 tanks in our next 9 games so this is the most important stretch of the year. If we could lose all of those tank games we would suddenly be looking at a top 5 lottery spot with opportunity to get even higher. 

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Nets (20-41) 123

Cavs (35-24) 129

Nets played a very very good game and would have come out with a win if not for some damn impressive shots by the Cavaliers in the last few minutes. Nets hung around all game, coming back every time Cavs looked like they would make a run. They were up in the last minute, but Cavs just kept making shots. I didn't expect a win to begin with, so seeing the Nets play this well was a very good sign. It's really too bad they couldn't pull out the win, but if they keep up this kind of play they will be winning a lot more for the rest of the season.

**Bad (but promising) for tank**

&nbsp;

76ers(32-26) 101

Heat (31-29) 102

76ers led for almost the the whole second half, but Wade hopped in a time machine and took over in the 4th quarter. 76ers win would have been much better for us, with them being closer to passing the Pelicans. We'll need them to pick it up now if they are going to do that.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Wizards(35-25) 107

Bucks (33-26) 105

Bucks were down huge the whole first half. They battled back to make it very close in the end, but they never actually led the whole game. Both teams need to win a lot to stay ahead of the Pelicans, didn't matter too much who won this one. Bucks need to pick it up though, they are just 1.5 games from slipping into the 8 seed.

**Neutral for tank**

&nbsp;

Kings (18-42) 99

Blazers(34-26) 116

The Kings played better than the score makes it seem. They never led, but they came back from a big deficit and kept it very close for a long time in the second half. They fell apart later in the 4th though, which they seem to do almost every game. We are just 2 games behind the Kings now, and they have some winnable games soon so passing them is still possible. Trail Blazers get a good win to keep ahead of the Pelicans, so we do get some benefit from this game.

**Bad for tank, good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Clippers (31-27) 122

Nuggets (33-27) 120

Come from behind win for the hot Clippers finally puts them into a playoff spot. They are tied for the 8 seed with the Nuggets, but have the better winning percentage. The Nuggets led by 19 late in the 3rd quarter, but the Clippers went on a 18-6 run for the rest of the quarter, and they kept that up in the 4th to take the lead. Nuggets battled back but couldn't win it in the end. We want both of these teams to pass the Pelicans, so either result would have been pretty good. Nuggets would have been a little better because they would have been just 0.5 behind the Pelicans, but now both Clippers and Nuggets are 1.5 games behind them. 

**Neutral/slightly bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Bucks (33-27) vs Pistons (28-32) 

Spread: Pistons -1.5

Both teams are not playing their best right now. Pistons aren't a realistic possibility to catch the Pelicans anymore, Bucks are only a game behind the Pelicans so they are the team to root for. 

**Go Bucks!**

&nbsp;

Raptors (42-17) vs Magic (18-43)

Spread: Raptors -9.0

Hard to imagine the Magic beating the Raptors. Magic are on a 6 game losing streak, but they haven't been that bad during the skid, only losing by an average of 6.3 points. If they show up and play the Raptors tough that'll be good enough for me. We are just 1.5 games behind them, so all they need is just a few upsets and we pass them.

**Go Magic!**

&nbsp;

Pacers (34-26) vs Hawks (18-43)

Spread: Pacers -5.0

Hawks look really really bad lately, but the Pacers did just lose to the Mavericks the other day so who knows. Hawks are ahead of us by 2 games, very catchable if they get an upset tonight. 

**Go Hawks!**

&nbsp;

Hornets (28-33) vs Celtics (43-19)

Spread: Celtics -7.5

Hornets are hot but Celtics will be tough to beat. Neither team will likely affect either of our picks, but the Hornets have a slightly better chance of affecting the Pelicans pick (but pretty much only if they win out). This one's pretty irrelevant to us though.

**Go Hornets!**

&nbsp;

Warriors (47-14) vs Wizards (36-25)

Spread: Warriors -9.0

Both teams are playing well lately, Wizards need to keep winning to stay ahead of the Pelicans, just 1.5 games ahead of them right now. It'll be tough playing the Warriors after a close game yesterday though. 

**Go Wizards!**

&nbsp;

Suns (18-44) vs Grizzlies (18-41)

Spread: Grizzlies -1.5

Every day the other tanks keep losing so we can never gain any games on them. One of these teams has to win though, so today we are gaining a game on one of them. Suns win and we are only 2 games back of the lottery lead, Grizzlies win and we are just 1 game from passing them. I would rather have the Grizzlies win this one. The Suns are the team I think we are least likely to pass, whereas the Grizzlies are much more likely. Both tanks will be putting their 10 game losing streaks to the test, but either way this game helps the tank.

**Go Grizzlies!**

&nbsp;

Thunder (35-27) vs Mavericks (19-42)

Spread: Thunder -5.0

Thunder have come dangerously close to losing to a couple other tanks lately, hopefully this will be the day they do. Mavericks are coming off of a big upset win over the Pacers, another win here would put the Bulls back only 0.5 games. The next game for the Mavericks after this is against the Bulls, so a win (or at least a good showing) could give them some momentum to beat us. A Thunder win isn't bad either, with them still tied with the Pelicans.

**Go Mavericks!**

&nbsp;

Pelicans (34-26) vs Spurs (36-25)

Spread: Spurs -4.5

The Pelicans are one of the hottest teams in the league, but this is the toughest game for them in a while. Spurs will likely have a better plan to at least slow down Davis. This is very big for the Pelicans pick, because a Pelicans win would put them 0.5 games behind the Spurs. On the other hand a Spurs win would put them back up to 2.5 ahead of the Pelicans, and more importantly break the Pels winning streak.

**Go Spurs!**

&nbsp;

Rockets (47-13) vs Clippers (31-27)

Spread: Rockets -8.0

Clippers have been playing well for a long time and finally forced their way into the playoffs. They'll be met by the best and hottest team in the NBA, Rockets are currently on a 13 game win streak. Clippers are only 1.5 games behind the Pelicans now, we need them to keep winning and pass them up in the West.

**Go Clippers!**

"We finally gained on some teams!!! It took a while, but we are finally moving forward. Mavericks won too so the Nets aren't the only team we're gaining on. Pelicans won and a couple other games didn't go our way, but yesterday was definitely a big win for the tank.

Today the Bulls have a chance to gain another half game on the rest of the tanks with a game against the Hornets. A couple other games have draft ramifications too, but not the biggest night.

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Lakers (26-34) 123

Hawks (18-43) 104

Lakers feast on yet another tank, leading by a double digits for the whole second half. Hawks don't have a lot of easy games the rest of the way, so when they don't win games like these it's hard to see us passing them.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies(18-41) 98

Celtics (43-19) 109

Celtics got an early lead and never gave it up. Grizzlies actually outplayed the Celtics the whole second half, but I imagine that was because of the Celtics being on cruise control, with all their starters playing less than 26 minutes a piece. 

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Bulls (20-40) 87

Nets (20-41) 109

Bulls went out and got a clutch loss against a very bad Nets team. Some of their guys chose the perfect game to get hot, and they took the game over in the third quarter. We got some positives from the game too, with Lauri shooting a lot better than his last two games, and Dunn shooting it very well too. To counteract this, we had a huge clutch performance from Justin Holiday (shot 1-11) after missing some time. Valentine (4-16) and Payne (1-10) came up big as well.

This loss was great for us, gaining a game on the Nets as well as the Mavericks. We also kept pace with the rest of the tanks on a day we could have just as easily won and fell further behind. We are now just 0.5 games back from the Nets, and we play them twice more before the end of the season. We are also just 1.5 games back from the Mavericks, who looked great. If we manage to pass those two teams we would over double our chances for a top 3 pick and over double our chances for the top pick.

**Very good for the tank**

&nbsp;

Warriors(46-14) 125

Knicks (24-37) 111

Knicks kept it really close for the first half before the Warriors blew them out in the third quarter. Take away that one quarter though and the Knicks outscored the Warriors the other three. Good sings from a Knicks team that looked really terrible of late. They are still just 3 games behind us in the lottery standings.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Pistons (28-32) 94

Raptors(42-17) 123

Raptors destroyed the Pistons, making it look easy. Barring a huge change, the Pistons are no longer a realistic possibility to pass the Pelicans. They are now only a game ahead of the Hornets, even though they were looking like a possible playoff team before the break. 

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Suns (18-43) 116

Pelicans(33-26) 125

Suns tease all the other tanks with a possible win before pulling off yet another loss. They dominated early and lead by 17 points in the second quarter. Then they forgot the Pelicans had this guy named Anthony Davis and got stomped on by him for the rest of the game. They did very little to defend Davis, not doubling him on defense, not helping quick enough when they got beat, and not boxing him out on the defensive boards. Suns could have had a shot to win this game if they made a special effort to stop Davis. 

Pelicans extend their streak to 6 games and are now tied for the 5th seed in the West. I really thought at the break the Pelicans would either miss or barely make the playoffs, but this point I'm just hoping they end with a pick still in the teens. Davis is just a monster though, I hope that he slows down enough to get back in the 7-8 seed range. 

**Bad for the tank, bad for the Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Magic (18-41) 105

Thunder (34-27) 112

Magic lead for most of the first half, and then almost came back to win it in the end. Not sure if it was because they played well or because the Thunder played bad, but I'll take it as a good sign. Too bad the Magic couldn't pull it out, but on the plus side, the Thunder keep pace with the Pelicans, staying tied with them in the West.

**Bad for tank, good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Pacers (34-25) 103

Mavericks(18-42) 109

Bulls already had a good day gaining a game on the Nets, but now the Mavericks won, and against a playoff team too. I watched the 4th quarter, and the Mavs played some surprisingly good defense against the Pacers for most of the 4th. Then they broke down a bit with only a few minutes left and shrunk the lead to 2. They hit some clutch shots in the end to finish with the win. Mavericks are now just 1.5 games ahead of us, and we can shrink that to 1 game with a loss today. 

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Rockets(46-13) 96

Jazz (31-29) 85

Jazz played pretty well, leading by 15 in the second quarter. Rockets came back strong though and the Jazz couldn't keep up. Jazz are still just 2.5 out of a playoff spot and 3.5 behind the Pelicans. If the Pelicans continue at this pace there no real hope for the Jazz to pass them, but if they slip up I still see the Jazz as a possibility to catch them.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Wolves(37-26) 118

Kings (18-41) 100

Kings keep the game close for the first half, but the Wolves turned it up in the second half to win it easy. Kings have a lot of hot stretches, but they can never sustain it enough to win any games. Timberwolves take the 3 seed from the Spurs with their win, but they are still just 2 games ahead of the Pelicans. 

**Bad for the tank, good for the Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Bulls (20-40) vs Hornets (27-33) 

Spread: Hornets -10.5

Hornets are hot, on a 4 game winning streak right now. They are also at home with a day of rest against the Bulls who are on a back to back. They are also now in the realistic playoff hunt, with how bad the Pistons and Heat have been playing. On the other hand, the Bulls have won our other two games agains them this year, including one where Kemba scored 47. 

I'd assume Lavine is back today, and will probably get the ball a lot with everyone else less rested. I could see this being a game where Lavine and a few others could play well and we still lose. Lets hope for a good game from the Hornets, so we can have some positive play and still lose.

A loss today could possibly pass the Nets, and put us just one game away from the 5th lottery spot.

**Go Hornets!**

&nbsp;

Nets (20-41) vs Cavaliers (35-24)

Spread: Cavaliers -10.5

I'm guessing the Nets will sit RHJ and Lavert since they just came back from injury. So lets hope Crabbe and Allen can do the same to Cleveland that they did to us. Cavaliers will be playing extra hard to win though, with them owning the Nets draft pick. Cavs likely win this, but another good showing from the Nets would be a good sign for the rest of the year.

**Go Nets!**

&nbsp;

76ers (32-26) vs Heat (31-29)

Spread: Heat -1.0

76ers are just one game back from the Pelicans, as opposed to the Heat being 3 games back. Ideally they both pass the Pelicans but with how well the Pelicans have been playing, the Heat aren't looking too realistic now. 76ers are hot though and could get ahead of the Pelicans if they stay that way.

**Go 76ers**

&nbsp;

Wizards (35-25) vs Bucks (33-26)

Spread: Bucks -3.0

Bucks are just 0.5 games behind the Pelicans, and the Wizards are 1 game ahead of the Pelicans. We want both teams to be ahead of them at the end of the season, so whichever team wins this one doesn't matter too much. Slight edge to the Bucks with them being behind the Pelicans, we really need some teams to start passing them up.

**Go Bucks!**

&nbsp;

Kings (18-42) vs Trail Blazers (34-26)

Spread: Trail Blazers -12.0

Trail Blazers almost lost to the Suns two days ago so I guess anything's possible here. Kings win could put us just one game behind them today. Trail Blazers win wouldn't be too bad either, with them currently tied up with the Pelicans in the West. 

**Go Kings!**

&nbsp;

Clippers (31-27) vs Nuggets (33-27)

Spread: Nuggets -4.5

Once again a game in which we want both teams to win and finish ahead of the Pelicans. Edge goes to the Nuggets with them being closer, but both of these teams are hot and could pass the Pelicans if Davis goes back to being human.

**Go Nuggets!**

Davis is just a monster though, I hope that he slows down enough to get back in the 7-8 seed range. 

**Bad for the tank, bad for the Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Magic (18-41) 105

Thunder (34-27) 112

Magic lead for most of the first half, and then almost came back to win it in the end. Not sure if it was because they played well or because the Thunder played bad, but I'll take it as a good sign. Too bad the Magic couldn't pull it out, but on the plus side, the Thunder keep pace with the Pelicans, staying tied with them in the West.

**Bad for tank, good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Pacers (34-25) 103

Mavericks(18-42) 109

Bulls already had a good day gaining a game on the Nets, but now the Mavericks won, and against a playoff team too. I watched the 4th quarter, and the Mavs played some surprisingly good defense against the Pacers for most of the 4th. Then they broke down a bit with only a few minutes left and shrunk the lead to 2. They hit some clutch shots in the end to finish with the win. Mavericks are now just 1.5 games ahead of us, and we can shrink that to 1 game with a loss today. 

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Rockets(46-13) 96

Jazz (31-29) 85

Jazz played pretty well, leading by 15 in the second quarter. Rockets came back strong though and the Jazz couldn't keep up. Jazz are still just 2.5 out of a playoff spot and 3.5 behind the Pelicans. If the Pelicans continue at this pace there no real hope for the Jazz to pass them, but if they slip up I still see the Jazz as a possibility to catch them.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Wolves(37-26) 118

Kings (18-41) 100

Kings keep the game close for the first half, but the Wolves turned it up in the second half to win it easy. Kings have a lot of hot stretches, but they can never sustain it enough to win any games. Timberwolves take the 3 seed from the Spurs with their win, but they are still just 2 games ahead of the Pelicans. 

**Bad for the tank, good for the Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Bulls (20-40) vs Hornets (27-33) 

Spread: Hornets -10.5

Hornets are hot, on a 4 game winning streak right now. They are also at home with a day of rest against the Bulls who are on a back to back. They are also now in the realistic playoff hunt, with how bad the Pistons and Heat have been playing. On the other hand, the Bulls have won our other two games agains them this year, including one where Kemba scored 47. 

I'd assume Lavine is back today, and will probably get the ball a lot with everyone else less rested. I could see this being a game where Lavine and a few others could play well and we still lose. Lets hope for a good game from the Hornets, so we can have some positive play and still lose.

A loss today could possibly pass the Nets, and put us just one game away from the 5th lottery spot.

**Go Hornets!**

&nbsp;

Nets (20-41) vs Cavaliers (35-24)

Spread: Cavaliers -10.5

I'm guessing the Nets will sit RHJ and Lavert since they just came back from injury. So lets hope Crabbe and Allen can do the same to Cleveland that they did to us. Cavaliers will be playing extra hard to win though, with them owning the Nets draft pick. Cavs likely win this, but another good showing from the Nets would be a good sign for the rest of the year.

**Go Nets!**

&nbsp;

76ers (32-26) vs Heat (31-29)

Spread: Heat -1.0

76ers are just one game back from the Pelicans, as opposed to the Heat being 3 games back. Ideally they both pass the Pelicans but with how well the Pelicans have been playing, the Heat aren't looking too realistic now. 76ers are hot though and could get ahead of the Pelicans if they stay that way.

**Go 76ers**

&nbsp;

Wizards (35-25) vs Bucks (33-26)

Spread: Bucks -3.0

Bucks are just 0.5 games behind the Pelicans, and the Wizards are 1 game ahead of the Pelicans. We want both teams to be ahead of them at the end of the season, so whichever team wins this one doesn't matter too much. Slight edge to the Bucks with them being behind the Pelicans, we really need some teams to start passing them up.

**Go Bucks!**

&nbsp;

Kings (18-42) vs Trail Blazers (34-26)

Spread: Trail Blazers -12.0

Trail Blazers almost lost to the Suns two days ago so I guess anything's possible here. Kings win could put us just one game behind them today. Trail Blazers win wouldn't be too bad either, with them currently tied up with the Pelicans in the West. 

**Go Kings!**

&nbsp;

Clippers (31-27) vs Nuggets (33-27)

Spread: Nuggets -4.5

Once again a game in which we want both teams to win and finish ahead of the Pelicans. Edge goes to the Nuggets with them being closer, but both of these teams are hot and could pass the Pelicans if Davis goes back to being human.

**Go Nuggets!**

"Yet another bad day for the tank yesterday. Damn Pelicans just keep winning, making our chances of a mid-teens spot for their pick less likely by the day.

Huge day today with all 10 games having some impact on our two picks. We have a chance to double dip on two games, with the Bulls playing the Nets and the Pelicans playing the Suns.

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Pistons (28-31) 98

Hornets(27-33) 114

Hornets destroyed the Pistons, never leading by less than 15 in the second half. I thought coming out of the break that the Pistons could possibly pass the Pelicans to lower that pick as low as 12. Pelicans have only won since then though, and Pistons have only lost. Pistons are now 4 games away from the Pelicans and not looking like they will move too much.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Pelicans (33-26) 123

Bucks (33-26) 121

Pelicans win again. Win it in OT again. Beat a playoff team again. The Bucks finally held Davis under 30 points for the first time in forever, but Holiday went off for 36. They are going to be playing a lot of back to backs coming up, so we gotta hope that they will get drained and lose a few soon.

The more the Pelicans move up playoff spots in the West, the more we have to worry about them getting a winnable first round matchup. They looked to be on the way to a first round exit against the Rockets or Warriors, but right now they have the 6th seed and would play the Spurs. They are also just two games from having the 3rd seed themselves. 

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Spurs(36-25) 122

Cavs (35-24) 94

If the Spurs had lost, they would have been just 1 game ahead of the Pelicans, so this was a huge win here. Spurs become a much more important team now, with them and the Timberwolves standing in the way of home court advantage for the Pelicans.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

76ers (32-26) 94

Wizards(35-25) 109

Both teams were hot coming into this one, but the Wizards won it pretty easily. Embiid and Simmons were good again but aren't receiving much help lately. Both teams are close to the Pelicans and could help improve the pick by finishing ahead of them. 

**Neutral for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Rockets (46-13) 119

Nuggets (33-27) 114

Nuggets played well but Rockets are just unstoppable right now, winning 12th in a row. Nuggets fall behind the Pelicans now, but it's only 0.5 games and Nuggets can change that quickly if they keep playing the way they have.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Lakers (25-34) vs Hawks (18-42)

Hawks have one of their few games against a non-playoff teams, but that hasn't stopped them from losing before. Their bad defense could also soon be getting even worse, with Ilyasova about to be bought out. Lakers play their 3rd tank since the break and they are 2-0 so far. 

**Go Hawks!**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (18-40) vs Celtics (42-19)

Tyreke is day-to-day and they already sucked when he played, so I'm not gonna strain myself too hard hoping for a win against the Celtics. 

**Go Grizzlies!**

&nbsp;

Bulls (20-39) vs Nets (19-41)

Huge game for the tank, one of three more games against the Nets till the end of the year. A Bulls loss would put us just 0.5 games back from the Nets, in good position to pass them in the lottery standings. It will be tough though, with the Nets having lost their last 8 in a row. They will be getting both Hollis-Jefferson and LaVert back from injury, so that could provide them with a boost. Both guys will come off the bench and be on minute restrictions. 

Bulls look like the better team, but this is a game we can't afford to win. With how terrible the other tanks have been lately we haven't been able to gain any ground even when we lose. This is finally a game that could move us closer, and to a team we could definitely pass.

**Go Nets!!!!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

Warriors (46-14) vs Knicks (24-37)

Knicks played pretty decent against the Celtics, so maybe the Warriors take a mental health day and Knicks win it. Much more likely though, Knicks would be just 2 games behind our lottery spot if we win our game and they lose theirs. 

**Go Knicks!**

&nbsp;

Pistons (28-31) vs Raptors (41-17)

Pistons don't look like they will pass the Pelicans anymore, but they're closer to affecting the Pelicans than the Raptors are. 

**Go Pistons!**

&nbsp;

Suns (18-43) vs Pelicans (33-26)

Pelicans are on the second of a back to back and their last two games went into overtime. They've got to be feeling some fatigue today. Unfortunately, They play the worst team in the NBA. The Suns did just almost beat the Trail Blazers though, so a win for them is not entirely ridiculous. If they won here that would be a massive gain for the Bulls, possibly getting to just 2 gams back of the Suns. It would also break the Pelicans momentum at a crucial time for them. I just don't see the Suns stopping Anthony Davis though.

**Go Suns!**

&nbsp;

Magic (18-41) vs Thunder (34-27)

Magic are on a 5 game losing streak but they were playing pretty well before that started. Thunder have lost 6 of their last 10 and do not look good at all. This is a pretty winnable game for the Magic, who are just 2 games ahead of the Bulls now. A Thunder win wouldn't be too bad of a thing either, with them now tied with the Pelicans in the West. Bulls pick has priority, but either result would be a pretty good thing.

**Go Magic!**

&nbsp;

Pacers (34-25) vs Mavericks (18-42)

Mans beat the Pacers in their last matchup, but that was when the Pacers were cold and also without Oladipo. They are now on a 4 game winning streak and will have Oladipo for this one. Mavericks kept it close against the Jazz a few days ago, don't look horrible despite a 4 game losing streak.

**Go Mavericks!**

&nbsp;

Rockets (46-13) vs Jazz (31-29)

Jazz are still trying to break into the West playoffs but are having a hard time with how well the teams ahead of them are playing. They will have an even harder time tonight agains the Rockets and their 12 game win streak. Rockets are on a back to back though, and the Jazz had the previous longest streak before it ended last week. Jazz just 2.5 games back of Pelicans, still could pass them if they keep winning.

**Go Jazz!**

&nbsp;

Timberwolves (37-26) vs Kings (18-41)

Kings almost beat the Timberwolves in their previous matchup just two weeks ago. Wolves are now without Butler and can be have a lot of bad streaks when Wiggins isn't on or when they don't get the ball to KAT. Not likely, but also not too crazy for the Kings to win this one. 

**Go Kings!**

Nuggets (33-27) 114

Nuggets played well but Rockets are just unstoppable right now, winning 12th in a row. Nuggets fall behind the Pelicans now, but it's only 0.5 games and Nuggets can change that quickly if they keep playing the way they have.

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Lakers (25-34) vs Hawks (18-42)

Hawks have one of their few games against a non-playoff teams, but that hasn't stopped them from losing before. Their bad defense could also soon be getting even worse, with Ilyasova about to be bought out. Lakers play their 3rd tank since the break and they are 2-0 so far. 

**Go Hawks!**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (18-40) vs Celtics (42-19)

Tyreke is day-to-day and they already sucked when he played, so I'm not gonna strain myself too hard hoping for a win against the Celtics. 

**Go Grizzlies!**

&nbsp;

Bulls (20-39) vs Nets (19-41)

Huge game for the tank, one of three more games against the Nets till the end of the year. A Bulls loss would put us just 0.5 games back from the Nets, in good position to pass them in the lottery standings. It will be tough though, with the Nets having lost their last 8 in a row. They will be getting both Hollis-Jefferson and LaVert back from injury, so that could provide them with a boost. Both guys will come off the bench and be on minute restrictions. 

Bulls look like the better team, but this is a game we can't afford to win. With how terrible the other tanks have been lately we haven't been able to gain any ground even when we lose. This is finally a game that could move us closer, and to a team we could definitely pass.

**Go Nets!!!!!!!!!**

&nbsp;

Warriors (46-14) vs Knicks (24-37)

Knicks played pretty decent against the Celtics, so maybe the Warriors take a mental health day and Knicks win it. Much more likely though, Knicks would be just 2 games behind our lottery spot if we win our game and they lose theirs. 

**Go Knicks!**

&nbsp;

Pistons (28-31) vs Raptors (41-17)

Pistons don't look like they will pass the Pelicans anymore, but they're closer to affecting the Pelicans than the Raptors are. 

**Go Pistons!**

&nbsp;

Suns (18-43) vs Pelicans (33-26)

Pelicans are on the second of a back to back and their last two games went into overtime. They've got to be feeling some fatigue today. Unfortunately, They play the worst team in the NBA. The Suns did just almost beat the Trail Blazers though, so a win for them is not entirely ridiculous. If they won here that would be a massive gain for the Bulls, possibly getting to just 2 gams back of the Suns. It would also break the Pelicans momentum at a crucial time for them. I just don't see the Suns stopping Anthony Davis though.

**Go Suns!**

&nbsp;

Magic (18-41) vs Thunder (34-27)

Magic are on a 5 game losing streak but they were playing pretty well before that started. Thunder have lost 6 of their last 10 and do not look good at all. This is a pretty winnable game for the Magic, who are just 2 games ahead of the Bulls now. A Thunder win wouldn't be too bad of a thing either, with them now tied with the Pelicans in the West. Bulls pick has priority, but either result would be a pretty good thing.

**Go Magic!**

&nbsp;

Pacers (34-25) vs Mavericks (18-42)

Mans beat the Pacers in their last matchup, but that was when the Pacers were cold and also without Oladipo. They are now on a 4 game winning streak and will have Oladipo for this one. Mavericks kept it close against the Jazz a few days ago, don't look horrible despite a 4 game losing streak.

**Go Mavericks!**

&nbsp;

Rockets (46-13) vs Jazz (31-29)

Jazz are still trying to break into the West playoffs but are having a hard time with how well the teams ahead of them are playing. They will have an even harder time tonight agains the Rockets and their 12 game win streak. Rockets are on a back to back though, and the Jazz had the previous longest streak before it ended last week. Jazz just 2.5 games back of Pelicans, still could pass them if they keep winning.

**Go Jazz!**

&nbsp;

Timberwolves (37-26) vs Kings (18-41)

Kings almost beat the Timberwolves in their previous matchup just two weeks ago. Wolves are now without Butler and can be have a lot of bad streaks when Wiggins isn't on or when they don't get the ball to KAT. Not likely, but also not too crazy for the Kings to win this one. 

**Go Kings!**

What do you guys see as Kris Dunn's floor and ceiling? I think he's still for sure one of the biggest question marks of the rebuild. It's hard to say if he'll be just a solid backup point guard or fringe all-star. Gonna be interesting if we draft a guard. He probably has the most potential on the defensive side of the ball –– I can see him making second or third team all defense at some point.

"Bulls pull out a clutch loss to make it a net positive for the tank today. Problem is other teams are doing some high level tanking as well, so it wasn't quite as good of a day as it could have been.

Today lots of games, and lot of opportunity to improve both picks. The Pelicans play, along with a bunch of other teams close to them in the standings. Also 4 tank teams play, including the Hawks and Suns who lead the lottery race.

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Nets (19-41) 96

Hornets(25-33) 111

Nets continue to play as bad as anyone in the league, and the Hornets won easily. Nets skid is now 8 games, longest losing streak in the league right now. They were still sitting Hollis-Jefferson and LeVert, but they said they are ""hopeful"" that the two would be back Monday vs the Bulls. Lets hope they are, we're going to need all the help we can get to tank that game.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Knicks(24-36) 120

Magic (18-40) 113

Magic lead for the first half but fell apart in the 3rd quarter and never got it back together. Gaining a game on the Magic would have been amazing, they still stay 2 games ahead of us. However, we do get some much needed breathing room from the Knicks. They were closing in fast, and we now have a nice 3 game cushion between us. That puts us closer to the top lottery spot than the spot behind us.

**Bad for tank (but also kinda good)**

&nbsp;

Wizards (34-24) 110

Cavaliers(34-23) 103

This game didn't really affect us, but on the off chance the Pelicans play really really well, the Wizards stay a little more in front of them, draft spot wise.

**Slightly good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

76ers(31-25) 116

Bulls (20-38) 115

Valentine is so committed to the tank he was taking notes when the Magic lost their game to us a few games ago. This was the best kind of game for the tank. We played really well and competed against a good team, but still came out with a loss in the end. Bobby was unstoppable, knocking down every shot (except the last one thank god). Nwaba also looked great as a starter, Lavine had a good game, fucking Cam Payne looked pretty good at times. Dunn and Lauri didn't have their best games, but that's gonna happen.

We're now just 2.5 games back of the lottery lead for the moment. Didn't gain on anyone playing today, but every loss is an opportunity to jump forward. One of these other tanks has to start winning eventually.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Thunder(34-26) 110

Kings (18-40) 107

We weren't the only team to come up with a clutch loss tonight. Kings came back big to lead for most of the 4th quarter, but lost on a buzzer beater from Westbrook. Thunder win does give them a bigger lead on the Pelicans, but they have not been looking good for a while now. A loss here would have been better, with the Kings unlikely to have many win chances as good as this the rest of the season. 

**Bad for tank, good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Clippers (30-27) 127

Warriors (45-14) 134

Clipper play really well and had a decent chance to win, but every time they got close Curry decided to drain another 3. Shame the Clippers couldn't pull it off, would have tied them with the Pelicans for the last playoff spot.

**Bad for Pelicans pick** 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Celtics (40-19) vs Pistons (28-29)

Pistons don't currently factor into either of our picks, but if the Pelicans fall out of the playoffs, Pistons could pass them up and help that draft pick. Boston's on a 3 game losing streak so its a good time to grab a win against them.

**Go Pistons!**

&nbsp;

Hawks (18-41) vs Pacers (33-25)

I don't really see the Bulls catching the Hawks, but a win here would make it a lot more possible. Hawks play a lot of playoff teams, so if we have any chance they have to win a few against teams like the Pacers, good but beatable. Hawks played fairly well before the break (despite their record) so here's hoping for a win.

**Go Hawks!**

&nbsp;

Hornets (25-33) vs Wizards (34-24)

Neither team will likely affect either of our picks. Hornets are now 5 games behind our lottery spot so I feel safe there. Wizards are just 2.5 games up on the Pelicans. I don't see them ending with a worse record than the Pels, but both teams can be streaky so who knows. You can pretty much take your pick for whoever you want to root for, but if you really want a Bulls connection I'd say Wizards for now.

**Go Wizards!**

&nbsp;

Bucks (32-25) vs Raptors (41-16)

Another game that doesn't really affect either pick too much. Bucks are only a game away from the Pelicans draft spot, so that could come into play if the Pelicans stay in the playoffs. Pretty much take your pick either way though.

**Go Bucks!**

&nbsp;

Timberwolves (36-25) vs Rockets (44-13)

The Pelicans probably won't catch the Wolves, but it's still possible, unlike catching the Rockets. Wolves could also use a jump start after a bad stretch before the break.

**Go Timberwolves!**

&nbsp;

Cavaliers (34-23) vs Grizzlies (18-38)

Grizzlies have looked really bad all season, but they have the talent to take some wins against playoff teams. Cavs are good, but it's an away game for them and the second of a back to back, coming off a loss to the Wizards last night. If there was any night for the Grizzlies to beat the Cavs its tonight. 

**Go Grizzlies!**

&nbsp;

Heat (30-28) vs Pelicans (31-26)

Heat not looking good lately, winning just 7 of 10 before the break. Hopefully they can end the Pelicans 3 game winning streak and help them out of the playoffs. A win from the Heat would have the added bonus of moving them closer to the Pelicans record. Whether the Pelicans make the playoffs make the playoffs or not, they will probably be close to the Heat in record, so we need as many Heat wins as we can get.

**Go Heat!**

&nbsp;

Spurs (35-24) vs Nuggets (32-26)

Nuggets just 0.5 games ahead of the Pelicans, need to keep playing well to stay ahead of them in the West. Spurs are on a 3 game losing streak and Nuggets on a 3 game winning streak so hopefully both teams can extend that to 4.

**Go Nuggets!**

&nbsp;

Clippers (30-27) vs Suns (18-41)

Both outcomes benefit us in a pretty big way. Suns are tied for the lottery lead, and a win from them would put the Bulls just 2 games back of them. Clippers are just 1 game back of the Pelicans in the West and could tie them with a Pels loss. I'm almost tempted to root for the Clippers, just because I think theres a much better chance the Clippers catch the Pelicans than the Bulls catch the Suns. I still think rooting for the Suns would be better though, because if they win this one then maybe they have the potential to win some more and we catch them. Good either way though.

**Go Suns!**

&nbsp;

Trail Blazers (32-26) vs Jazz (30-28)

Blazers are just 0.5 games up on the Pelicans, but the Jazz are just 1.5 games behind. Jazz are the hottest team in the league, but the Trail Blazers just beat the Warriors before the break. With how much I'm hoping the Pelicans fall out of the playoffs, I think the Jazz would be better to root for now. In the end we just want both of these teams to finish above the Pelicans, so a win either way is fine.

**Go Jazz!**

&nbsp;

Mavericks (18-40) vs Lakers (23-34)

Mavericks are one of the tanks with an easy enough schedule that we can catch them. Cuban openly admitted to tanking which could be a bad sign, but I'm going to hope that instead the Mavs pull some *Major League* shit and win a bunch of games just to spite their owner. Lakers are very beatable but they get Lonzo back tonight.

**Go Mavericks!**

&nbsp;

"Portis (at least for me) has been easy to overlook with Dunn, Lauri, and LaVine on the roster, but he's quietly having a solid season three. In his last ten games he's averaging 14 points and 8 rebounds while playing closer to 20 minutes per game than 30 i.e. he's playing about 5-10 less minutes than the starters.

Sometimes I struggle seeing where Bobby fits on this team.

* Is Bobby going to accept being Lauri's perpetual backup at PF?
* When Lopez is gone (or injured) could Bobby be a starting C?

I'm not a solid ""yes"" on either of those. 

If Bobby wants to start he's going to have to slide over to center. He's actually got the size to play center; believe it or not he's only giving up an inch and literally a couple lbs to guys like KAT and Steven Adams, so if Bobby hits the weights this summer and bulks up 5-10 lbs I think he'd be fine, especially in today's NBA, especially playing Hoiball. I guess I'm just not convinced he has the skill set to play center, but again, I'm not sure that's necessary anymore.

"At this time next year, post All Star break, rounding the corner, if they're in a roughly similar position in the standings, which direction do they head?

Everything I've seen points towards the idea that next year they're expecting 7th or 8th seed. Let's say they've underachieved a bit in the first 2/3s of the season.

"Was going to do this yesterday and a prospect evaluation today, but I'll just wait for another day to do the prospect one.

So right now we have the 8th lottery spot and we're 3 games back of the lead. Not the spot I hoped for at this point, but the success got us another first for Miritic so that balances things out a bit. There's still lots of room for us to move up in the lottery standings before the end of the year. 

This is what all the tank teams look like at this point. with a little of what I'm expecting of them for the rest of the season. The lottery vs playoff split is just for a rough idea, some teams with more lottery games still have a harder schedule.

Current standings: http://www.tankathon.com

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

1) Phoenix Suns (18-41): 23 games remaining (10 vs tanks, 13 vs winning teams)

Suns already look like the best tank in the league, and in addition to sucking they also have an incredibly difficult schedule the rest of the way. Their playoff games are usually against the very best (including 3 vs the Warriors) and they also have a lot of tough lottery games like the Clippers, Pistons, and Jazz.

Even with an easy schedule I never thought the Bulls would catch them. They just look so bad in every game I glimpse of them, and they will almost definitely be rewarded with a top 3 lottery spot.

**Will likely finish ahead of us**

&nbsp;

2) Atlanta Hawks (18-41): 23 games remaining (7 vs lottery teams, 16 vs playoff teams)

I was hoping for an easier schedule for the Hawks, as they looked fairly promising before the break. Their schedule is not as bad than the Suns, with more winnable games against the playoff teams like the Heat, 76ers, and Pacers. They are going to need to win a fair amount of those games and maybe steal a few games vs better playoff teams too.

I thought the Bulls had a good chance to catch them before looking at their schedule, since they have a lot of players playing better than they did at the beginning of the season. They will have to play consistently well for us to have a chance though

**Will likely finish ahead of us**

&nbsp;

3) Dallas Mavericks (18-40): 24 games remaining (13 vs lottery teams, 11 vs playoff teams)

Easy schedule the rest of the way for the Mavericks, pretty much every other game looks winnable for them. Bad news is that they are not looking too hot before the break. They are going to have to play better than they have for the Bulls to catch them. 

They have a couple players who could win them enough games for us to pass them. If Smith Jr improves his shooting, and maybe if Barnes or Dirk get hot, they could finish the second half with a lot more wins.

**Could finish behind us if they play well**

&nbsp;

4) Orlando Magic (18-39): 25 games remaining (14 vs lottery teams, 11 vs playoff teams)

Magic could definitely win a lot of these games, they have one 7 game stretch starting in late March where the best team they play is the Hornets. They just have this annoying tendency lately where they play pretty well and then lose in the end. They can't keep that up forever if they keep playing well, so I expect a good amount of wins after the break. 

They have a decent roster even after trading Payton. Hezonja (like him a lot) has improved a ton since the beginning of the year and they still have Gordon after the deadline. 

**Could finish behind us if they play well**

&nbsp;

5) Sacramento Kings (18-39): 25 games left (12 vs lottery teams, 13 vs playoff teams)

Not a terribly hard schedule but I don't think they're good enough to win these games. Not enough games against tank teams and way too many games against very good playoff teams that are pretty much auto-losses. They would have to win a lot of upsets for us to have a chance.

Randolph can be good when he's on, Fox looks decent at times, but as a team they are just not consistent enough to win as much as we need them to. Now with Hill gone they're even worse.

**Will likely finish ahead of us**

&nbsp;

6) Memphis Grizzlies (18-38): 26 games left (11 vs lottery teams, 15 vs playoff teams)

Not the easiest schedule, but they also have more games remaining which means more chances for improvement. They play us twice so we could pass them by simply losing both those games. They seem like they should be a lot better than they are with their roster, but they just keep on losing. They have the potential to improve but rarely show sings that they will.

Keeping Tyreke Evans makes them a lot better, but they need more than just him and Gasol to score. They're schedule is harder than ours but if they could just match our pace and then beat us twice that's all it takes.

**Could finish behind us if they play decent and win against us**

&nbsp;

7) Brooklyn Nets (19-40): 23 games left (12 vs lottery teams, 11 vs playoff teams)

Schedule has plenty of win opportunities, and they play 3 games vs the Bulls. If they swept those 3 I would say likely we finish ahead of them. Even 2 out of 3 would put us just a game back. Another positive is that they are not a tank. The other teams listed here could put some effort into tanking, like resting injured players more and giving more minutes to young players. The Nets don't own their pick, so they will likely do less of those practices.

Russell is still getting better each game after coming back from his injury, so that could boost the team after the break. They will also get Hollis-Jefferson and Lavert back sometime soon, which helps even more (though they are still out for their game tomorrow). The Nets have been annoyingly bad so far but I actually have a lot of hope that we pass them. Which knowing the Nets means they'll probably just lose even more.

**Good chance we could pass them**

&nbsp;

8) Chicago Bulls (20-37): 25 games left (15 vs lottery teams, 10 vs playoff teams)

We have possibly the easiest schedule for the rest of the year among all the teams here. On one hand, this is very bad for the tank. Playing lottery teams gives us a better chance to win, which would lose even more ground in the lottery standings. 

On the other hand, this schedule gives us a lot of opportunities to ""double dip"" by losing. All these lottery games mean that each loss is also a win for a team we are competing with. If we lose a majority of our games against lottery teams we could do a lot to 

We're starting Felicio and Nwaba now, which is great for our tanking purposes. Nwaba is good so we don't lose too much there, but starting Felicio over Rolo could be a big help in losing more games. I'm a little worried about our bench outplaying other teams now, so we're going to have to rely on our long lost tank commander Payne to sink our production there. 

We don't want to see any regression on Markkanen, Dunn, and Lavine, so hopefully we can still lose while having our big 3 playing well. It may seem like asking for too much, but don't forget that we were the worst team in the league by far to start the year, and that was with Markkanen and Dunn playing pretty well. They are both better now and Lavine is playing well too, but I think with the right balance of Felicio + bench playing bad, we can have both player development and losses.

**Likely to finish between 4th-9th**

&nbsp;

9) New York Knicks (23-36): 23 games left (9 vs lottery teams, 14 vs playoff teams)

Didn't think we needed to worry about the Knicks but they've been on a losing tear ever since losing Porzingis. They are 2 games back from us and play a lot of games vs playoff teams to rack up even more losses. If the Bulls lose as much as I hope they do The Knicks shouldn't be a problem. But if we slip up and win a few in a row, they will swoop right in and take our spot.

Don't know too much about their team, but Beasley is going to be huge for them. He's playing major minutes with Porzingis out, and he's been good enough this year to get them some wins. He's streaky though so who knows if he hurts them more than he helps.

**Could finish ahead of us if we play well**

&nbsp;

10) Los Angelos Lakers (23-34) and 

11) Charlotte Hornets (24-33): These teams don't look like they will be any threat to us now, but if we start playing well after the break they could be a threat to pass us. Only 3 and 4 games back from us right now. 

**Likely to finish behind us**

&nbsp;

16) New Orleans Pelicans (31-26): 25 games left (11 vs lottery teams, 14 vs playoff teams)

The Pelicans schedule looks about average, about 1 in 4 of their games are against teams they are competing with in the West. They play 3 games against the Clippers so there's a good opportunity for a team to pass them there. After that just one game against the Thunder, Jazz, and Trail Blazers. 

Since losing Cousins they seem to rely almost entirely on Davis to win. They lost a bunch of games while he wasn't playing his best, but they're now on a 3 game win streak with Davis ending up about 40-10 in each game. Whoever plays them the rest of the year really needs to shut down Davis at all costs. Not that easy since it's AD but just do whatever to limit him and let the rest of the team try to beat you. 

There's 10 teams within just 2 games of the Pelicans so they have a lot of opportunity to climb or fall. Huge range of spots they could end up, hard to figure out which way they'll go with how inconsistent they have been.

**Likely to finish between 12th-20th**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

There's all the teams to watch for now. Some teams I've watched more than others, so if you're familiar with a team and think I missed something let me know.

Tomorrow I'll go back to posting normal threads with each game for the day. ","Tank Watch: February 21, 2018 (Tank race evaluation) Was going to do this yesterday and a prospect evaluation today, but I'll just wait for another day to do the prospect one.

Keeping Tyreke Evans makes them a lot better, but they need more than just him and Gasol to score. They're schedule is harder than ours but if they could just match our pace and then beat us twice that's all it takes.

**Could finish behind us if they play decent and win against us**

&nbsp;

7) Brooklyn Nets (19-40): 23 games left (12 vs lottery teams, 11 vs playoff teams)

Schedule has plenty of win opportunities, and they play 3 games vs the Bulls. If they swept those 3 I would say likely we finish ahead of them. Even 2 out of 3 would put us just a game back. Another positive is that they are not a tank. The other teams listed here could put some effort into tanking, like resting injured players more and giving more minutes to young players. The Nets don't own their pick, so they will likely do less of those practices.

Russell is still getting better each game after coming back from his injury, so that could boost the team after the break. They will also get Hollis-Jefferson and Lavert back sometime soon, which helps even more (though they are still out for their game tomorrow). The Nets have been annoyingly bad so far but I actually have a lot of hope that we pass them. Which knowing the Nets means they'll probably just lose even more.

**Good chance we could pass them**

&nbsp;

8) Chicago Bulls (20-37): 25 games left (15 vs lottery teams, 10 vs playoff teams)

We have possibly the easiest schedule for the rest of the year among all the teams here. On one hand, this is very bad for the tank. Playing lottery teams gives us a better chance to win, which would lose even more ground in the lottery standings. 

On the other hand, this schedule gives us a lot of opportunities to ""double dip"" by losing. All these lottery games mean that each loss is also a win for a team we are competing with. If we lose a majority of our games against lottery teams we could do a lot to 

We're starting Felicio and Nwaba now, which is great for our tanking purposes. Nwaba is good so we don't lose too much there, but starting Felicio over Rolo could be a big help in losing more games. I'm a little worried about our bench outplaying other teams now, so we're going to have to rely on our long lost tank commander Payne to sink our production there. 

We don't want to see any regression on Markkanen, Dunn, and Lavine, so hopefully we can still lose while having our big 3 playing well. It may seem like asking for too much, but don't forget that we were the worst team in the league by far to start the year, and that was with Markkanen and Dunn playing pretty well. They are both better now and Lavine is playing well too, but I think with the right balance of Felicio + bench playing bad, we can have both player development and losses.

**Likely to finish between 4th-9th**

&nbsp;

9) New York Knicks (23-36): 23 games left (9 vs lottery teams, 14 vs playoff teams)

Didn't think we needed to worry about the Knicks but they've been on a losing tear ever since losing Porzingis. They are 2 games back from us and play a lot of games vs playoff teams to rack up even more losses. If the Bulls lose as much as I hope they do The Knicks shouldn't be a problem. But if we slip up and win a few in a row, they will swoop right in and take our spot.

Don't know too much about their team, but Beasley is going to be huge for them. He's playing major minutes with Porzingis out, and he's been good enough this year to get them some wins. He's streaky though so who knows if he hurts them more than he helps.

**Could finish ahead of us if we play well**

&nbsp;

10) Los Angelos Lakers (23-34) and 

11) Charlotte Hornets (24-33): These teams don't look like they will be any threat to us now, but if we start playing well after the break they could be a threat to pass us. Only 3 and 4 games back from us right now. 

**Likely to finish behind us**

&nbsp;

16) New Orleans Pelicans (31-26): 25 games left (11 vs lottery teams, 14 vs playoff teams)

The Pelicans schedule looks about average, about 1 in 4 of their games are against teams they are competing with in the West. They play 3 games against the Clippers so there's a good opportunity for a team to pass them there. After that just one game against the Thunder, Jazz, and Trail Blazers. 

Since losing Cousins they seem to rely almost entirely on Davis to win. They lost a bunch of games while he wasn't playing his best, but they're now on a 3 game win streak with Davis ending up about 40-10 in each game. Whoever plays them the rest of the year really needs to shut down Davis at all costs. Not that easy since it's AD but just do whatever to limit him and let the rest of the team try to beat you. 

There's 10 teams within just 2 games of the Pelicans so they have a lot of opportunity to climb or fall. Huge range of spots they could end up, hard to figure out which way they'll go with how inconsistent they have been.

**Likely to finish between 12th-20th**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

There's all the teams to watch for now. Some teams I've watched more than others, so if you're familiar with a team and think I missed something let me know.

"We know the two points of weakness most in need of addressing are at SF and C. If JJJ keeps rising, there's a good chance that MPJ falls to around the 5-6th pick, where the Bulls could feasibly be picking with their new and improved tanker's paradise lineup. If that's the case, he's the easy selection for me, even if Bagley is still on the board. 

The reasoning is simple: MPJ projects to be a two-way presence, while Bagley has looked absolutely hapless in Duke's defensive schemes. Lauri is a better defender than expected, but we can't afford to play him side-by-side with a big who struggles. 

With our second pick, then, we can target centers. While Wendell Carter has likely risen out of our range with the Pels pick, this is a good, deep draft for rim-runners who can protect the hoop. Mitchell Robinson (former WKU recruit, now focused only on draft prep), Daniel Gafford (Arkansas), and Robert Williams (Tex A&M) are my favorites. Robinson's decision not to play abroad makes it a little difficult to scout him, but he's got a good frame and he's really quick off his feet to block and rebound. His shooting stroke is also coming along. Gafford and Williams are perhaps *safer* prospects, but they are also less likely than Robinson to yield a Jaren Jackson-esque product. 

Worst case scenario, we take Mikal and whoever the fuck we want with the Pels pick, win the lottery next year, and draft RJ Barrett. Six more rings. I'm not pressed about it.

You would think the Nets would be willing to win since they don't have a draft pick this year, but even teams without draft picks will often rest veterans and take a look at bench players once the playoffs are out of reach.  The Mavs, Grizzlies, and Hawks are definitely tanking, so if the Bulls can lose the next ten games in a row that will be a major achievement.

In the ten games after that, the Bulls play the Grizzlies again, the Knicks, and the Magic, again all challenging games to lose.  In the last five games they play the Nets twice, and there's always the danger that the Hornets, Celtics, and Pistons will have their seeding locked up -- or will have been eliminated from the playoffs -- and won't try to win those last games.

It's going to be a challenge, but I really like the front office commitment to bench players.  Ordinarily that would ensure losses, but we'll have to see if other tanking teams do the same.

Edit:  Mark Cuban just said the Mavs are not tanking, so we can mark that game down as a loss.  I’m going to keep an eye on the other bad teams as they resume playing.

"Hey Guys,

I know there's been a ton of talk on here about the City Edition Jerseys, and we shared a few weeks back in a thread that our team store would get more in the coming weeks. 

We wanted to let you know that stock just came in, and that right now we have availability in all sizes. It's fairly limited though so if you want one we suggest moving fast! Best way to grab one is to call the Madhouse Team Store on 312-455-4600, or pop in in-person. They are actually offering free shipping (in the US, exc. Alaska & Hawaii) on City Edition Jerseys at the moment. If you want to add a name/ number it'll add about three weeks to the shipping date as those are done elsewhere so that the lettering matches the 'Chicago' style on the front of the jersey.  

Hope this doesn't come across spammy - admins feel free to delete if you find this too promotional. I know there's been a lot of interest in these though so wanted to share here!

Shout with any questions..

Nichols will be joined by Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer Tracy McGrady and actor Michael B.

DeAndre Ayton has a rare combination of strength, power, and athleticism that has drawn comparisons to Hall of Famers like David Robinson and Patrick Ewing. 

He’s a favorite of Pac-12 announcer Bill Walton. It’s impossible to get through one of Walton’s Arizona games without half a dozen calls for Ayton to “Throw it down!” In Ayton’s game against the Oregon Ducks, he dunked it with such ferocity that Walton exclaimed, [“VULCAN’S ANVIL!”](https://streamable.com/thjxl) (Vulcan’s Anvil is a massive volcanic monolith that protrudes out of the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, named after the Roman god, Vulcan) Much like Vulcan’s Anvil, DeAndre Ayton towers over the rest of the 2018 draft class. 

Ayton projects to have a pretty sturdy floor in the NBA. He should be one of the league’s best rebounders the second he becomes a pro. Ayton is immovable on the block, and he goes after boards with gusto. He uses his length and soft touch around the rim to reach over defenders for tip-ins. On the offensive end, he’s constantly [pointing for the ball-handler to throw an alley-oop](https://streamable.com/8zrrs), and Ayton is keen to answer Bill Walton’s call to “throw it down” when a lob comes his way. In fact, Sean Miller has employed an [alley-oop inbound play](https://streamable.com/uixry) throughout the season. DeAndre Ayton should flourish as a finisher in the pick-and-roll at the next level. At the very least, Ayton should be able to equal Andre Drummond’s success in the NBA.

However, unlike Andre Drummond, DeAndre Ayton possesses a shooting range that stretches out to the three-point line. Ayton doesn’t hesitate to shoot the ball when left unguarded. He has made 10 of his 29 (34.5%) attempts from beyond the arc. In comparison, Karl Anthony Towns made 2 of 8 (25%) three-point attempts while at Kentucky. Kristaps Porzingis made 60 of 169 (35.5%) three-point attempts in three years with Liga ACB. Joel Embiid made just 1 of 5 attempts from three-point range in his year at Kansas (to be fair, Embiid really didn’t develop his three-point shot until his two “red-shirt” years with the Sixers).

Ayton is nearly automatic from inside the paint. His size,strength, and leaping ability allows him to [dunk over most of his collegiate opponents](https://streamable.com/00fzt), but he has also shown an ability to create shots with his patience and [footwork in the post](https://streamable.com/ftv6k). DeAndre Ayton is shooting over 60% from the field this season, so many teams resort to fouling hard once Ayton gets inside. However, DeAndre Ayton is a competent free-throw shooter. He’s making nearly 74% of his free-throws this season.

The Bahamian big man still has some holes in his game. Most notably, DeAndre Ayton isn’t a reliable shot-blocker or rim protector at this point in his career. He projects to be the third best rim protector in the 2018 class after Mo Bamba and Jaren Jackson Jr.  Ayton also isn’t as fluid as other big men like Joel Embiid and Karl Anthony Towns. Sometimes he struggles with ball control when facing up a defender. Although, [he has shown flashes of good ball-handling for his size](https://streamable.com/wzxys).
  
Ultimately, DeAndre Ayton’s flaws can be overcome with hard work and good coaching. He has quick feet and active hands, so, with time, he should be able to become an anchor defensively. It’s time to stop speculating about Luka Doncic, Marvin Bagley, or Trae Young as the first overall pick. ""DeAndre Ayton"" will be the first name called in June’s draft.

The Bahamian big man still has some holes in his game. Most notably, DeAndre Ayton isn’t a reliable shot-blocker or rim protector at this point in his career. He projects to be the third best rim protector in the 2018 class after Mo Bamba and Jaren Jackson Jr.  Ayton also isn’t as fluid as other big men like Joel Embiid and Karl Anthony Towns. Sometimes he struggles with ball control when facing up a defender. Although, [he has shown flashes of good ball-handling for his size](https://streamable.com/wzxys).
  
Ultimately, DeAndre Ayton’s flaws can be overcome with hard work and good coaching. He has quick feet and active hands, so, with time, he should be able to become an anchor defensively. It’s time to stop speculating about Luka Doncic, Marvin Bagley, or Trae Young as the first overall pick. ""DeAndre Ayton"" will be the first name called in June’s draft. Ayton has unique upside, and it would be foolish for any team to pass up drafting him.",24,22,"DeAndre ""The Anvil"" Ayton will be the first pick in the 2018 draft",https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/7xz6hs/deandre_the_anvil_ayton_will_be_the_first_pick_in/

For example when drose was shipped to the Knicks, I bought a Knicks drose shirt just cuz he’s my fave bull of all time. I always kinda rooted for his/Knicks success in his tenure there. 
Now with jimmy buckets on the twolves and rondo on the peps I always root for them too... now the problem is my friends always give me shit saying I’m not a real bulls fan.  at the end of the day, if the bulls play any of those teams I’d obviously rather see the bulls win but in current state it’s not likely.

"So many different games that were so close to going our way yesterday. Every tank team (other than Bulls and Suns) only lost by single digits. The close games from the other teams are promising, they just need to start turning a few of these close losses into close wins. 

We don't gain any ground, but we also don't lose any ground either. Even though there are a lot of games that were bad for the tank, today was still not a net loss thanks to our loss to the Raptors. We'll have to hope for more games where tanks play each other so they are forced to get some wins.

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Hawks (18-41) 98

Pistons (28-29) 104

Hawks pulled out all the stops to tank this game, sitting over half of their starters, and they still almost won. They were down 30 points in the third quarter, and they worked it all the way down to a 4 point game before they ran out of time. Hawks have looked like a much better team the last few weeks, and I do think they will start stringing more wins together at some point.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Hornets(24-33) 104

Magic (18-39) 102

Magic lead with under 2 minutes left, but ended up losing another close game. They are similar to the Hawks, playing many close games but unable to turn them into wins. Hezonja looks legit though, leading their team in points the last 3 games now. If he keeps playing better they could get a few more wins than previously expected.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Heat (30-28) 102

76ers(30-25) 104

No effect on the Bulls. 76ers are hot, Heat are not. Heat might drop out of playoff position if they keep losing.

**No effect on tank**

&nbsp;

Pacers(33-25) 108

Nets (19-40) 103

Yet another close game that the tank team couldn't win in the end. Nets lead with 4 minutes left, but Oladipo hit a 3 and the Pacers took the lead for good. It was nice to see some life from the Nets against a good team, but it would be nice if one of these teams would actually start winning.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Wizards(33-24) 118

Knicks (23-36) 113

Knicks were up 21 points at the half and still managed to lose it all in one quarter. They extend their losing streak to 8 games. They are a late starting tank, but they are certainly on a roll and will be threatening our position for the rest of the year.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Clippers(30-26) 129

Celtics (40-19) 119

The surprising Clippers keep winning, beating the Celtics who are now on a 3 game losing streak. The Pelicans also won, so the Clippers couldn't get into a playoff spot. But if they keep playing like this they will get there over someone.

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Raptors(41-16) 122

Bulls (20-37) 98

Bulls played very well in the first quarter, but the Raptors took the game over after that. Despite the loss, Bulls do not gain any ground on any tank teams (other than 0.5 games on the Mavericks) since the rest of them lost their games too. It's pretty frustrating to lose and still gain nothing, but with so many bad teams this will be a familiar feeling for the rest of the year.

LaVine didn't have the best game, shooting just 29.4% for the game. He has been pretty streaky since he's been back, but he could still be finding his rhythm after missing so much time. Hopefully he can find some more balance after the break. Dunn looked a little rusty, but he also didn't turn the ball over at all so that's a good sign. He'll have time to get his endurance back over the break, so the chemistry between him, Markkanen and LaVine can finally start to develop.

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Kings (18-39) 91

Rockets(44-13) 100

Kings never lead in the second half, but they managed to keep it fairly close for a lot of the 4th quarter. Never thought the Kings would win it, so I guess it's just good that they didn't let the Rockets run away with it.  

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Thunder (33-26) 121

Grizzlies (18-38) 114

Grizzlies continue the theme of close games for tank teams. They were down just one point in the last minute of the game before Melo hit a 3 to ice the game. I've thought all year that the Grizzlies would turn things around at some point, but they just keep on losing. At least from this game we got some benefit, as the Thunder maintain their lead over the Pelicans. 

**Bad for tank, good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Lakers (23-33) 117

Pelicans(31-26) 139

Pelicans scored 46 in the first quarter and lead for the whole game. Davis scored at will, getting 42 points on just 18 field goal attempts. I know it's easier said than done, but teams really need to focus on stopping AD, because the only games that they win lately are when he has a monster game. 

**Bad for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Suns (18-41) 97

Jazz (30-28) 107

Suns actually played a pretty decent game, keeping the hottest team in the league a lot closer than I thought they would. I doubt we challenge them in the second half, but it's still only 3 games so a small win streak from them could even us up. Luckily we still got something from the Jazz, who win their 11th straight. They keep closing in on the West playoffs, and it's only a matter of time before they get in and stay in. That means someone comes out, and hopefully it'll be the Pelicans.

**Bad for tank, good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

Warriors(44-14) 117

Blazers (32-26) 123

Durant and Lillard both played out of their minds. Blazers got out to a 20 point lead in the first quarter and never gave it up. Warriors mounted several comebacks and got very close, but Portland had an answer every time. I only saw the 4th quarter, but damn was that fun to watch. Trail Blazers maintained their lead over the Pelicans, forcing them back in the last playoff spot. Even though the Pelicans won, they did not gain any games in the West because all the other teams close to them won too (except the Nuggets who play tomorrow).

**Good for Pelicans pick**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games** (only two today, last day before the all-star break)

&nbsp;

Nuggets (31-26) vs Bucks (32-24)

Nuggets could take back their half game lead on the Pelicans with a win, but they could fall out of the playoffs with a loss (technically tied, but winning percentage would be worse than Clippers). Should be a good game, with both teams having similar records and on recent hot streaks. Extra important for the Nuggets to win now with the Pelicans on a winning streak.

**Go Nuggets!**

&nbsp;

Lakers (23-33) vs Timberwolves (35-25)

Neither of these teams are teams I'm very worried about for either pick. However, at this point the Timberwolves only have a 2.5 game lead over the Pelicans in the West. If the Wolves continue playing the way they have lately (4-6 in their last 10), they could be in danger of sinking to the bottom of the playoff race. It would be much better for us if they just got hot again and didn't look back.

**Go Timberwolves!**

"Happy Valentines Day! Not the best tank day yesterday, but still some positives there. Today is a big day for the whole league with a whopping 12 games being played. All but one of them have major ramifications for our draft situation so it could be a very good day.

Also this was a long one, I probably made a mistake or two. Let me know if you see anything and I'll fix it.

&nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Heat (30-26) 112

Raptors(39-16) 115

This one didn't have any affect on us, but if anyone is going to win the East I'd rather have it be the Raptors than the other contenders.

**No effect on tank**

&nbsp;

Hawks (18-39) 92

Bucks (31-24) 97

Hawks play another good game but can't finish with a win. they lead for most of the first half, but had a very bad 3rd quarter. They made a nice comeback to tie it in the fourth, but the Bucks took it in the end. Good signs from the Hawks though, hopefully they can start turning those close games into wins.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Rockets(42-13) 126

Wolves (35-24) 108

Timberwolves not looking too good lately. Rockets stay really hot, they are winning their games easily of late. Wolves have too much talent to keep losing but they better turn it around soon to avoid getting grouped with the bottom half of the playoff teams instead of the top. I'm still not worried about them staying ahead of the Pelicans, but it's only a 3 game lead right now so it's not impossible. 

**Slightly bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Cavaliers (33-22) 120

Thunder (32-25) 112

Cavs look good again, looking every day like their post deadline success actually might be for real. Thunder had Westbrook and Melo back but couldn't take this one. Thunder are not looking good lately, 4-6 in their last 10. Need a turn around soon if they are going to stay ahead of the Pelicans, only up a game right now.

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Kings (17-38) 114

Mavs (18-39) 109

Did not watch, but Kings lead big for most of the game. I was surprised to check the final and see that it was so close. Kings seem to be finding their groove lately, now 5-5 in their last 10. If they keep this up it would help a lot making it easier to pass them. Mavericks fall into a three way tie for the top lottery spot, still look like a pretty airtight tank. 

**Good for tank (would have been good either way)**

&nbsp;

Spurs (35-23) 109

Nuggets(30-26) 117

Very close game, lots of lead changes. Big win for the Nuggets who take their lead back from the Pelicans in the West playoffs. Good to see one of the teams that are closest to the Pelicans are looking very good lately, especially against good teams like the Spurs. We need the Nuggets (along with the Thunder, Trail Blazers, Clippers, and Jazz) to all play well enough to keep the Pelicans out of a playoff spot. 

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Hawks (18-40) vs Pistons (27-29)

Hawks playing in second of back to back, but it's their last game before the all-star break so hopefully they'll still come with a strong effort. They have looked good lately and could definitely grab a win today against the Pistons who are on a 3 game losing streak that came right after their Black Griffin winning streak. These are the types of games we need to Hawks to win a couple of if we are going to pass them.

**Go Hawks!**

&nbsp;

Hornets (23-33) vs Magic (18-38)

Both teams are 4-6 in their last 10, looking pretty mediocre but also good at times. Just like the Hawks, this is the type of game the Magic need to win for us to pass them. It's not against a tank team, but a very beatable team for them. Let's just hope the game doesn't come down to an inbounds pass.

**Go Magic!**

&nbsp;

Heat (30-27) vs 76ers (29-25)

This is the only game that has no effect on either of the Bulls picks. 76ers are playing well lately and just passed the Heat for the 7th spot in the East. Heat almost passed the Cavs a few weeks ago but have not looked good since.

**Take your pick, no effect**

&nbsp;

Pacers (32-25) vs Nets (19-39)

Nets almost beat the Pelicans a few games ago, the biggest highlight on their current 6 game losing streak. They have looked very bad lately, and I doubt they can stop Oladipo enough to have a chance. They get Hollis-Jefferson and Lavert back after the break (at least I think so), so if they could steal a win here though that could give them some confidence coming out of the break.

**Go Nets!**

&nbsp;

Wizards (32-24) vs Knicks (23-35)

Knicks really need a win. They are on a 7 game losing streak, and I can easily see that snowballing well into the double digits. They are now only 2 games behind us in the tank standings, and definitely look like the worse team. Wizards will probably take this one, but they have been inconsistent lately so maybe the Knicks surprise them with a decent game and steal a win.

**Go Knicks!**

&nbsp;

Clippers (29-26) vs Celtics (40-18)

Both teams are 6-4 in their last 10. Pistons have been surprisingly good after losing Blake Griffin. I didn't expect them to stay so close to the playoff race, but they could knock the Pelicans out of the last spot today. Hopefully they can take out the Celtics during one of their few ""down"" (at least for them) parts of the season.

**Go Clippers!**

&nbsp;

Raptors (40-16) vs Bulls (20-36)

Dunn recently got updated to being active and starting tonight. He'll only play 20 minutes, most likely because he was quoted as needing to get his endurance back. That brings us back to full strength for the first time since trading Mirotic, so it will be interesting to see how we play. On one hand, a loss here could go a long ways toward a good tank today before the break. On the other hand, wins against good teams like the Raptors are better than wins against fellow tank teams. 

Best case scenario: Lavine, Markkanen, and Dunn all play good games, but the Bulls lose a close one in the end.

**Go Raptors!**

&nbsp;

Kings (18-38) vs Rockets (43-13)

Kings look pretty good lately, but the Rockets are in top form and have been destroying lottery teams. Not too much hope for a Kings win, but every team slips up every once in a while. 

**Go Kings!**

&nbsp;

Thunder (32-26) vs Grizzlies (18-37)

Either way this game benefits us in some way. Grizzlies look very bad lately. A win for them would be good, don't want them to get too far ahead of us in the tank standings. Thunder also don't look very good lately, only 1.5 games from falling out of the playoffs. A win for them would be good to put some distance between them and the Pelicans. I prioritize our pick over the Pelicans pick, so I would root for Grizzlies, but both outcomes benefit us. 

**Take your pick, both benefit us**

&nbsp;

Lakers (23-32) vs Pelicans (30-26)

Pelicans looked pretty bad after losing Cousins, but they've won their last two now to stay in playoff position. They usually live or die based on how Davis plays, so hopefully the Lakers can at least slow him down. Lakers are hitting their stride lately, winning 7 of their last 10. They could help us out a lot here with a win today.

**Go Lakers!**

&nbsp;

Suns (18-40) vs Jazz (29-28)

I have about as much hope for the Suns to win this as I have for the Kings to beat the Rockets. Jazz look unstoppable, and the Suns look extremely stoppable. Luckily, a Jazz win can still benefit us, since they are right on the heels of the Pelicans for a playoff spot. The Suns win would help us too, since we're 3 games back of them. I don't see us out-tanking the Suns, but a lot of things could happen before the end of the season. And if the Suns can stop this Jazz streak, they definitely have more potential than I thought.

**Take your pick, both benefit us**

&nbsp;

Warriors (44-13) vs Trail Blazers (31-26)

Trail Blazers are just 0.5 games ahead of the Pelicans, so we need them winning all the games they can. Our best hope tonight is that the Warriors are saving their energy for the all-star game, they likely take this one. Blazers are good though and will come out hard against the Warriors. Any slip ups and the Blazers could get a big win for the Pelicans pick.

**Go Trail Blazers!**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Tankathon Standings found here: http://www.tankathon.com

* Bulls pick is currently at 8 and we are 3 games back of the top spot. 

* Currently all 7 teams in front of us are separated by just 1.5 games

* 6 of the 7 teams ahead of us play today, could be a huge day for us 

* Pelicans are tied for the 16th spot, just 0.5 games from slipping out of the playoffs

* If the Pelicans get knocked out of the playoffs, the Pistons and Heat could be other teams to root for. They would be the teams close enough to push the Pelicans down to the 12th pick. It is most important for the Pelicans to lose a lot, since it is unlikely that all 8 teams that are within 2 games of them keep playing well.","Tank Watch: February 14, 2018 Happy Valentines Day!

"Yesterday was not the best day for the tank. A lot of opportunities for improvement for both our pick and the Pelicans pick but not much went our way. There's a couple chances for improvement today so hopefully we can get a few wins to work in our favor.

&amp;nbsp;

**Yesterday's Results**

&amp;nbsp;

Pelicans(30-26) 118

Pistons (27-29) 103

Anthony Davis took over the game dropping 38 points and the Pelicans lead for almost the whole game. Miritic played pretty well too with 21 points, coming off the bench. Let's hope the Pelicans get back to losing quick.

**Bad for tank**

&amp;nbsp;

Kicks (23-35) 92

76ers(29-25) 108

Knicks continue to be really bad without Porzingis. Combined with the Bulls win, I'm starting to think the Knicks will pass us in the lottery. 

**Bad for tank**

&amp;nbsp;

Clippers(29-26) 114

Nets (19-39) 101

Nets also continue to be very bad, looking to be a huge obstacle in the tankathon standings. They've dropped 10 of their last 11 and just don't look like they are going to be able to string any wins together. Clippers don't lose any ground to the Pelicans though so they stay within striking distance of pushing them out of the playoffs.

**Bad for our tank, good for Pelicans pick**

&amp;nbsp;

Magic(18-38) 101

Bulls (20-36) 105

Bulls get the win after the Magic forget how to inbound pass. I thought the game was over when we were up 18 and playing good offense in the 4th. The Magic played really well though (with some Bulls help) to come all the way back and then I thought they had the win. But one bad pass and they out-tanked us in the end. This could have been a huge game for us to tie up one of the big tank teams, but instead we fall further behind the pack. 

On the other hand it was good to see Lavine play well again, especially playing aggressive defense to get the steal in the clutch. He also had some very good passes in the 4th. Markkanen also had a nice game looking really strong in the paint. Always good to have  games from our future star players. Wins aren't always bad, but preferably we'll save the rest of our wins for playoff teams and when we have Dunn back.

**Very bad for tank**

&amp;nbsp;

Spurs(35-23) 99

Jazz (29-28) 101

Jazz win again, making it 10 straight wins. They continue to charge into the playoffs, gaining ground on a large group toward the bottom of the West playoff race. Ideally they pass the Pelicans in the next week or so and never look back. 

**Good for tank**

&amp;nbsp;

Suns (18-40) 83

Warriors(44-13) 129

Warriors win again and Suns lose again, not too surprising (I'm actually writing this at halftime, not too worried I'll have to go back and change it). It puts the Suns another game in front of us, and they look like a top tank in the middle of a 5 game losing streak. 

**Bad for tank**

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&amp;nbsp;

Heat (30-26) vs Raptors (39-16)

Doesn't affect us at all, I like the Raptors at the top of the division though so that would be cool if they kept it up and stayed there.

**No effect, take your pick**

&amp;nbsp;

Hawks (18-39) vs Bucks (31-24)

Hawks are playing pretty well lately, but the Bucks are playing a lot better. Hawks looked like a top tank but they could be a team we could pass if they keep winning at a decent pace. 

**Go Hawks**

&amp;nbsp;

Rockets (42-13) vs Timberwolves (35-24)

Timberwolves are only 3.5 games ahead of the Pelicans right now. I'm pretty confident the Pelicans won't pass them, but it's definitely possible if they got on a huge run. I usually root for the Wolves anyways so not too different.

**Go Timberwolves**

&amp;nbsp;

Cavaliers (33-22) vs Thunder (32-25)

Thunder only have 1.5 on the Pelicans, so they could use a few wins to put some distance behind them. Cavs looked good after going through major trade changes, but that was only one game, hopefully they struggle a bit more tonight.

**Go Thunder!**

&amp;nbsp;

Spurs (35-22) vs Jazz (28-28)

Jazz are the hottest team in the NBA but playing the Spurs in the second of back to back nights is tough. Jazz could move within 0.5 games of the Pelicans with a win and a Pels loss.

**Go Jazz!**

&amp;nbsp;

Kings (17-38) vs Mavericks (18-39)

One of the safety games I like having, because one of the teams we're chasing have to gain a win. Kings are leading the lottery race but have gone 4-5 following an 8 game losing streak. Mavs are 2-8 lately, haven't seen them but they've kept a lot of games close. We need both teams to start winning, and luckily one of them has to get one tonight.

**Take your pick, both good for tank**

&amp;nbsp;

Spurs (35-23) vs Nuggets (30-26)

Nuggets are tied up with the Pelicans for the 7th spot in the West. They are playing pretty well lately and the Spurs pretty average, so a good chance they win here and put themselves back ahead of the Pelicans.

**Go Nuggets!**

&amp;nbsp;

* Bulls pick is currently at 8 and we are 2.5 games back of the top spot. 

* Currently all 7 teams in front of us are separated by just 1 game

* Pelicans are tied for the 15th spot, last spot in the playoffs

* There are 6 teams (Thunder, Blazers, Nuggets, Pelicans, Clippers, Jazz) who hold positions 5-10 in the West and are only separated by 3 games. For the rest of the season it is huge for the Pelicans to do bad and for the other 5 teams to do well. It could be the difference between the 12th pick in the draft, and the Pelicans looking at possibly making the second round.

"I must admit I was a bit surprised to see your fans so upset on r/nba about winning last night. I mean I get it, our sub is rooting for our team to lose as well and we really don't have much else to be excited about. 

But I think you guys are in a different situation. You have talented young players in Zach Lavine and Lauri and a pretty good cast of supporting players who are young as well. Winning can be a good thing for this group and gives them success to build on before next year. I can give you an example with the Magic, 2005-2006. That year we started the year 20-40 before we handed the keys to our 2nd year point guard and gave our 2nd year center more touches. That sparked a 16-6 run to end the year and that momentum carried over into the next season where Dwight Howard made his first of 8 straight All Star games and we made the playoffs. Looking back we absolutely wouldn't have been better off picking off 7th or 8th rather than 11th at the expense of those guys sparking their careers.

What I'm trying to say is you guys should want to see your young players play up to their talent level. You might miss on a pick a couple of spots higher, but seeing Zach Lavine break out the second half of the season is way more valuable to your franchise. The flip side, losing has a negative effect on the development of your key young players. Believe me, as a Magic fan I've seen this absolutely first hand, watching young guys struggle to develop with us and then breaking out when they get in a better situation.","Magic Fan Here To Discuss Your ""Tank"" I must admit I was a bit surprised to see your fans so upset on r/nba about winning last night.

"When I started writing this, the post game thread (for a close Bulls win over the Magic) was about 80% negative.  ""fuck"". ""ugh"". People legit mad we won. When did fans start acting like this, seriously?

Don't get me wrong. I understand where you're coming from. You want the best pick possible. But if your young core comes up in the league getting their ass kicked every night, don't you think that might damage their progression? Their career, and confidence? And who wants to keep playing for a shit team? Who wants to watch a shit team? This isn't our passion project.

Of course if you aren't winning a championship, you would like the best pick possible. I get that too. But it's not that simple. First, it's a lottery. Nor is the 1st round immune to flops. And the tank isn't a proven method of success. Look at the 3 most successful teams since the late 90s. Spurs - yes of course there was Robinson/Duncan but they have stayed at the top of the league, what, 20 years after Duncan was drafted? They draft well late in the round and stow away great international talent. And they have the best coach of all time, IMO. The Lakers traded for Kobe and pretty much everything else was bringing in FA's. Shaq left and they retooled and did it again. Warriors drafted well, never settled for good, kept improving, and now everyone wants to go there. BTW, Steph was picked 7th. Klay 11th and Draymond was a 2nd rounder. 

If you really in your hearts don't see where I'm coming from, and you just want to lose every game, so be it. I get the tank to a degree, but it's not as simple as so many make it and damn....getting upset about a win...maybe temper that shit a bit. Thanks for reading.

Tankathon standings for the top lottery odds: http://www.tankathon.com

&nbsp;


**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Raptors (39-16) 123

Hornets (23-33) 103

Hornets aren't that bad and don't worry me too much, but they have the potential to drop below us if we get on a roll and they keep playing inconsistently.

**Slightly bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Pistons(27-28) 115

Hawks (18-39) 118

Great win for the tank. Hawks had the worst record in the league before their win. They have been playing decent lately too, good chance we could drop below them over the next few weeks

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Cavs (33-22) 121

Celtics(40-18) 99

Both playoff teams, neither affect us

**No Effect on tank**

&nbsp;

Knicks (23-24) 113

Pacers (32-25) 121

Knicks drop their 6th in a row. They didn't play too bad this game, but without Porzingis they are starting to seem like they could drop below us if we play too well

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Mavericks(18-39) 97

Rockets (42-13) 104

Mavs may have lost, but they played one of the best teams in the NBA really well for the whole game. They are 2-8 in their last 10 but haven't actually played as bad as that record would make it seem. They've had a few more good, close games like this one. Could be a sign that they will start winning more soon.

**Bad (but promising) for tank**

&nbsp;

Kings (17-38) 106

Wolves(35-24) 111

Kings played it close but still lost, are now the leaders in tankathon standings

**Bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Grizzlies (18-37) 92

Thunder (32-25) 110

Grizzlies looking really bad lately, dropping 6th in a row. Hopefully they get rolling or they could be hard to catch. Thunder are only 2 games ahead of Pelicans, so at least that win is beneficial to us.

**Bad (but not entirely) for tank**

&nbsp;

Jazz (28-28) 115

Blazers(31-26) 96

Jazz on fire win their 9th straight. I think they will easily pass the Pelicans with the way they are playing. Portland is only 1 game ahead of the Pelicans though, so they need some wins to keep ahead of them. I'd prefer a Jazz win since they are still below the Pelicans for the time being, but we want both these teams to be winning a good amount the rest of the season.

**Slightly good for tank**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Today's Games**

&nbsp;

Pelicans (29-26) vs Pistons (27-28)

Big game for the tank. Pelicans won their last game but have not played very well since giving us their pick. A loss here could be big to continue a downward spiral for them. Pistons lost two after their Blake Griffin win streak, so hopefully they get back on track tonight.

**Go Pistons!**

&nbsp;

Kicks (23-34) vs 76ers (28-25)

Knicks have been really bad and they need to get a few wins here and there to stay out of the basement. 76ers are edge of the playoffs and playing pretty well lately (3 game win streak) so I'm not too optimistic the Knicks take them out tonight.

**Go Knicks!**

&nbsp;

Clippers (28-26) vs Nets (19-38)

Nets are looking really bad lately, dropping 5 in a row and 1-9 in their last 10. They can't even benefit from it since the Cavs have their pick, so they really need to start winning. Clippers are just 0.5 games behind the Pelicans, so a win for them would be good for us too. I personally would prefer a Nets loss, prioritizing our pick over the Pelicans pick, but either outcome benefits us in some way.

**Toss up, take your pick**

&nbsp;

Magic (18-37) vs Bulls (19-36)

Huge game for the tank. Not only can we lose our own game, but we can give a win to one of the teams we are chasing. We get back Lavine which could be huge if he continues what he showed against the Wolves. Magic have been pretty decent lately, 5-5 in their last 10. If they can beat us tonight and keep playing decent, that would be a big relief to have another team out of the way.

**Go Magic!!!**

&nbsp;

Spurs (35-22) vs Jazz (28-28)

Jazz are the hottest team in the NBA but playing the Spurs in the second of back to back nights is tough. Jazz could move within 0.5 games of the Pelicans with a win and a Pels loss.

**Go Jazz!**

&nbsp;

Suns (18-39) vs Warriors (43-13)

Suns have dropped their last 5 and are 1-9 in their last 10. I watched a couples games of theirs last week, and they look like the most insurmountable of the tanks in our way. Even if the Warriors take the game as a virtual night off, I don't see the Suns winning this one. They have a few decent young guys though so hopefully one might get hot and grab the team enough wins for us to out tank them. 

**Go Suns!**","Tank Watch: February 12, 2018 I saw a lot of people interested in having a tank thread yesterday, so here's all the games and how they affect our tank for good draft picks. If you guys like it I'll try to keep posting one every day for the season. It might not always be the best quality based on how much time I got but I'll do my best. Let me know if you have any problem with the format or anything.

Tankathon standings for the top lottery odds: http://www.tankathon.com

&nbsp;


**Yesterday's Results**

&nbsp;

Raptors (39-16) 123

Hornets (23-33) 103

Hornets aren't that bad and don't worry me too much, but they have the potential to drop below us if we get on a roll and they keep playing inconsistently.

**Slightly bad for tank**

&nbsp;

Pistons(27-28) 115

Hawks (18-39) 118

Great win for the tank. Hawks had the worst record in the league before their win. They have been playing decent lately too, good chance we could drop below them over the next few weeks

**Good for tank**

&nbsp;

Cavs (33-22) 121

Celtics(40-18) 99

Both playoff teams, neither affect us

**No Effect on tank**

"- If so, tell your story of the encounter you had with that player and just everything about the situation. 

- Did you ask for a pic? An autograph? Just chatted? Stared at them from afar? (Lol) etc..


- Ive ran into Joakim Noah at a restaurant. Didnt want to bother him for an autograph or a picture since he was trying to be lowkey but did shake his hand(felt like a little guy with small hands even though im 6’4. Just ate my hand) and say hello to his family when they were getting seated at their table. He had his mom, dad, sister and a couple buddies with him. His sister is pretty damn hot actually. It was funny tho, my table wasnt far from his and i saw a dude that was literally the table next to him ask for an autograph and Noah agreed. So the guy proceeded to take out a hundred dollar bill and Noah was like “no no man, what are you doing” , assuming the guy was going to pay him for an autograph, and the dude just goes “no man, just sign this hundred dollar bill for me” and Noah just started laughing haha.

- Other than that, just seen DRose play at Simeon back in the day and bumped fists when he was walking by to get to the court

"**Dallas**

Some people may disagree because they shipped out Harris who is still a good player and fan favorite, but I think they got better. They picked up Dougie (reunited with HS buddy Barnes) and didn't shed any young talent.

*Got better/didn't get worse... Bad Tank*


**Kings**

Hill gone gives Fox and Frank Mason more minutes, so if they have a good second half they could win some games, but I'm pretty sure the Kings managed to add L's to the column while focusing on development.

*Got worse... Good Tank*

**Grizzlies**

Not a lot of moves, but that in itself is something to note since they're apparently going to keep Tyreke. I think that gives them more wins than a lot of their fans probably want right about now.
 
*Stayed the same/Kept too many good players... Bad Tank*

**Hawks**

Kind of surprisingly quiet at the deadline with a couple of older guys playing well (Belinelli, Ilyasova)... but I'd say they stayed just about the same.

*Same Tank*

**Lakers**

Will probably get the hell out of our bottom 10, thank god. Finally we'll likely see one of the teams who aren't incentivised to tank out of the race for the top 10 pick (process that, Philly).

*Good for team... Bad Tank*

**Orlando**

Got rid of payton and apparently only have 1 PG left on the team who isn't injured... but they didn't move Gordon so they still have that? 

*Not sure what you're doing... Great Tank*

**Nets**

Didn't do anything, basically. Nets, you are not invited to our party and we'd thank you to leave so please win some and stop helping the Cavs.

*Please stop... Inexplicable tank*

**Suns**

Picked up Payton who will likely win them some games they can't afford to lose.

*Good for team... Bad Tank*



In my opinion some of these teams are losing the forest for the trees and are completely gutting their team of all talent in order to get a good player in the draft, maybe forgetting that they also have to have 4 other players on the court. Unfortunately this may squeeze us out of the coveted top 5 pick, but it might not be the worst thing in the longer run... But feel free to discuss and disagree with any/all of my amateur assessment.

To be clear I’m not saying Zach LaVine = James Harden or that they will ever be on the same level, but it does give you a look at maybe what he can be if he improves his shot selection and continues to get better all around.

"Since the start of the season, i've been wondering why Antonio Blakeney is getting little to no minutes when he has been playing well, when he has played in the NBA and the G-league?

Down To Buck on YouTube had to say about Blakeneys minutes: 

""The reason Hoiberg only plays this scoring prodigy fifteen minutes a game is because if he played more than that, nobody on the Bulls would ever get to shoot the ball and it would hinder their development. You could argue that nobody on the Bulls is worth developing except for Markkanen, and I would understand that, but it's still better for team chemistry if the shots get distributed evenly and aren't all just Blakeney isos.

It's common for scorers who look good in small roles to regress when given a bigger role. I'm not saying Blakeney would regress, but it could happen if his minutes went up. You would see all the telltale signs of regression: his numbers would dip, his flattop would get limp and flaccid, and his skinny arms would get skinnier. Being a number one option or number two option on a bad team is not all fun and games""

"Despite the Niko to Jazz deal not happening, reports state that Bulls are still trying to work out a deal for Rodney Hood.  

First question I have is why.  Hood is decent on paper but I dont see anything about him that should keep the FO interested.  He's not much younger than Mirotic and is more or less a finished product.  He's a decent shooter but he's a shooting guard and the Bulls have like 5 of those already.

On that note, what would it take to get him?  If Bulls can include Holiday in the deal, it makes more sense.  What would a deal for Hood even look like?  In the TM I tried Hood, Exum, Favors for RoLo and Holiday.  It works and our projected wins is at a -9!  But in reality, I'm not sure what we have to offer that Jazz would want or acquiring Hood would look like.  Maybe RoLo.  

Lastly, what are your thoughts on trading for Hood?  Is it worth it?  I say maybe if we can get him for expendable assets only, along with one of our other SG's, but I don't see it being that easy.

"With the recent news according to WOJ https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7vfxjt/charania_center_willy_hernangomez_seeks_trade/?utm_source=reddit-android willy has expressed he wants out of the knicks organization. I thought that I would take it upon myself to see a hypothetical trade that could benefit both the knicks and Bulls. 

Knicks: With the growing concern that the knicks cant surround their franchise player (KP ) with sufficent talent many believe that the knicks window of oppurtunity is closing with every terrible signing (joakim noah's contract, THJ, Courtney Lee). The knicks want to compete and are only 2 games out of the playoffs. The knicks would do this trade for several reasons. 

1.) They unload their least desirable signing (joakim 2 years left 18 and 19 mil respectively)

2.) Make a push for the playoffs 

3.) Give KP and the rest of the franchise an actual direction for once 

4.) they are able to maintain some level of financial flexibility which will be a must if they ever hope in Pairing another allstar with KP

5.) Adds depth to their roster while also, adding a defensive unselfish player in ROLO 


Bulls: The bulls goal this year is simple, tank and aquire assets to ensure a bright future for the orginzation and its fans. With our core of markkanen, dunn and lavine our only pieces left that need help is obviously our SF and C positions. I'll name a few important reasons for this trade and benefits of gaining these assets. 

1.) Willy is only 23 years old! In 22 games as a starter, he averaged 11.6 points and 9.3 rebounds in 25.8 minutes. Shot 50% FG and 80% FT.

2.) Aquire more picks which could help a lot in a potential trade up in the draft

3.) We only need to deal with joakim's contract for the next two years only which will realistically give us 2 years to tank 

4.)we get rid of justin, jerian and rolo who dont fit our timeline and arent essential pieces which gives our other players such as, blakeney minutes to prove himself and show us why hes been killing it in the G-League

5.) With this trade it will still give us 34mil in cap space 

Also, a side note this trade was succesfull in NBA Trade Machine on ESPN

I get it the one huge negative of potentially going through with this deal is the fact that we will have 4 centers on the roster. In addition, to having to deal with joakim's contract and Omer's contract. However, in the last year of omer's contract (2019) he is only guranteed 3 million.

Summarize: Bulls trade Rolo+ jerian Grant+holiday for willy hernangomez + knick's 2018 first round pick+ joakim noah. The bulls go younger, aquire assets in willy and the pick while taking on joakim noah contract (2yrs left expected to make 18 and 19 mil). The knicks add depth while unloading one of the worst contracts in the league and push for a playoff run while being 2 games back from the 8th.

"So Bulls generally trade Nikola to NOLA with top 5 protection? Ok I understand why NOLA ask for top 5 protection, but in a rare case that NOLA falls in the lottery (out of playoffs/top 14 picks) and win the lottery (move into top 3 picks), the bulls receive no other backup compensation. Example in rare case this happens, usually teams in bulls position will then ask for the Pelicans following years 1st round pick with similar or less protection. 

Has anyone considered the rare case that this is a possibility and we possibly get no 1st round draft? Or is there more to the trade that has not been announced because it’s assumed NOLA will not win lottery?

"If we wanted a 1st bad enough to trade Niko, then we should really go for it and trade RoLo and/or Holiday. Basically, Niko was 26 pushing 27 with a modern game (3 point shooting, playmaking, faceup game, handle, ability to defend perimeter 4s and 4s down low). RoLo is 29 pushing 30 with an old school game (hustle, post D, post O, jumper only goes out to 17 feet). If Niko wasnt in our long term plans at 26/27 with his modern game, then RoLo cant be inour plans at 29/30 with his 2004 game. Also, RoLo is more expensive than Niko and worse. So, we should trade him. Now, he's not as valuable as Niko, but luckily there are multiple contenders who need his rim protection. Also Holiday is a guard who's pushing 29. Cleveland needs a defensive big better than Love/Thompson/Frye, and with Love out they need a big just to stay afloat. I think if we packaged RoLo with Holiday and took back Shump + Frye, we could get a 1st. We'd only take on an extra $646,000 this year and save like 8 million next year. Also, Washington needs a C better than Gortat or Mahimi, so either Gortat + 1st for RoLo straight up, Gortat + Meeks + 1st for RoLo + Holiday. I think one of either Cleveland or Washington could cough up a 1st for Rolo and Holiday. Also, the Bucks need a C, so maybe Henson or Teletovic and Delly + 1st for RoLo and Holiday. Basically if a 26 year old 4 like Niko needs to be traded them so do the 29 year old C with no 3 and the 28 year old guard.","We need to trade RoLo and Holiday If we wanted a 1st bad enough to trade Niko, then we should really go for it and trade RoLo and/or Holiday.

"Hope this is okay, but Oklahoma and Texas just played each other and I figured since Bamba and Young were top 10 prospects they might be worth discussion. 

Anyway, I was only able to catch the second half of the second half, but from stat lines and what I saw I can’t say I like either prospect. Young is the absolute focal point of this Oklahoma team, and although he has put up great numbers, I do not see him being nearly as effective in the NBA where he will not be able to be as ball dominant as he is at OU. His shot selection is very poor and when it doesn’t fall (like today) it’s severely hinders the teams success. He seems to distribute the ball well via the “Steph curry effect” (drawing defenders to him opening lanes for teammates) so I can’t completely write him off. Just would like to see him get his teammates more involved when his shot won’t fall. 

As for Bamba, I really didn’t get to see too much. I believe I remember people questioning his drive before (correct me if I’m wrong) but from what I noticed I too question his drive. He doesn’t really seem to be a high motor type of guy. It’s a shame because he flashes a lot of athleticism but he doesn’t really play with a fire you would hope to see in a promising young prospect. 

Anyone have anything they want to discuss about this game? Again sorry if this is a no no, I checked the rules and it didn’t seem like it violated any of them.

"So here is my Ultimate Timeline for the Chicago Bulls. It's what I would attempt to do if I was the GM.


As of right now, the Bulls are in full tank having just trade Nico to the Pels for a 1st round pick and Omar Asik (who could be cut with limited cap damage after the 2018/19 season).

We are also currently looking to trade RoLo. There are currently a few options to where he might land.
-Realistically, RoLo is traded for a 23-30 range first round pick, for a team looking to bolster its rotation for a playoff run.
-Depending on other teams desperations to clear cap / move terrible contracts, we could trade him (along with a few other parts) to a few different teams.
--The Cav's: We could trade RoLo, Holliday, Grant [Possibly Nwaba, which would make the deal more likely] and a 2nd rounder for the Brooklyn pick and any bad salary Cleveland wants to get rid of (T.T., J.R. Shump).
--The Knicks (this is a bit more outlandish, though both are): We trade RoLo and some combination of players for Noah's contract (arguably worst contract in the NBA) and their pick which is top 7 protected this year and top 5 protected next year.

After the trade deadline, we should have 3 first round picks. 
-As of now, we can speculate that the Pelicans pick will end up in the 9-15 range, and it could drop further depending on the teams performance. 
-Our pick will probably end up in the top 3 maybe 4 depending on our performance.
-The pick/s we get from a RoLo / Salary dump hybrid could end up being anywhere from 7-30, but for the sake of this hypothetical exercise these pick/s, packaged with the Pelicans pick, could be use to trade up to a team in the 7-9 range. 

Fast forward to draft day and the Bulls have a top three pick, and two other first rounders. Let say for the sake of this scenario, we have the #1 pick and Ayton is the consensus BPA. The five other teams in the 1-6 range (excluding the bulls), will probably not pick Porter. Teams like the Suns, Celtics / Lakers (from PHI) don't need another scoring SF in their rotation, and the Magic, Hawks, and Mav's are probably going to target other prospects due to the injury risks and the fact that Porter is probably going to go in the 5-6 range.

The Bulls trade their top 3 pick for either the 5th or 6th pick and get a future (prob 2019) first round pick (2 future firsts is another possibility) in return. We then use that 5/6 pick on Porter.

After this, we package our other two picks to trade up to the 7-9 range (this is harder / easier depending on who we trade RoLo / take bad salaries from). With this pick we grab Jackson Jr. 

We leave the draft with Porter, Jackson, and a top 5(ish) pick next draft. We get a very high ceiling player in Porter, a high floor plus decent high ceiling player in Jackson Jr. AND a great pick in next years draft (along with our own which could be a high pick as well).

Jackson Jr. fits the hoiball system perfectly and adds a nice defensive presence in the front-court alongside Lauri. Both of them can switch onto smaller players and play interior D as well. On the offensive side of the ball Jackson Jr. can stretch the floor with his 3pt shot as well as generate points on the inside when need be. Keep in mind, this is his floor projection, if he learns how to develop his own looks and improve on his passing he can easily be an all-star.

Porter profiles as a big risk big reward type of pick. If this injury doesn't derail his career, he could be the scoring catalyst of this offense and be the starting forward for the Bulls over the next decade. If injuries mess his career up, the Bulls have TWO insurance picks next draft that will probably be in the top 10 (if Porter really sucks we will have another top 5 pick).

Our starting lineup then becomes:

Dunn
LaVine
Porter
Lauri
Jackson Jr.

With 2 top 10 prospects from next year's draft as insurance (in case any of these players become terrible), bench players, or future tradable assets.

This is obviously an armchair GM opinion, but I think its somewhat possible. Please share opinions related to this timeline or your own.

Comment:

Any trade involving a lottery pick and RoLo would have to include a salary dump and maybe Nwaba (to the Cavs). The package trade to the 7-9 range could also be done with a late first, but it would have to involve other assets, it's why it'd be harder.","The Ultimate Timeline (opinion) So here is my Ultimate Timeline for the Chicago Bulls.

-Realistically, RoLo is traded for a 23-30 range first round pick, for a team looking to bolster its rotation for a playoff run.
-Depending on other teams desperations to clear cap / move terrible contracts, we could trade him (along with a few other parts) to a few different teams.
--The Cav's: We could trade RoLo, Holliday, Grant [Possibly Nwaba, which would make the deal more likely] and a 2nd rounder for the Brooklyn pick and any bad salary Cleveland wants to get rid of (T.T., J.R. Shump).
--The Knicks (this is a bit more outlandish, though both are): We trade RoLo and some combination of players for Noah's contract (arguably worst contract in the NBA) and their pick which is top 7 protected this year and top 5 protected next year.

After the trade deadline, we should have 3 first round picks. 
-As of now, we can speculate that the Pelicans pick will end up in the 9-15 range, and it could drop further depending on the teams performance. 
-Our pick will probably end up in the top 3 maybe 4 depending on our performance.
-The pick/s we get from a RoLo / Salary dump hybrid could end up being anywhere from 7-30, but for the sake of this hypothetical exercise these pick/s, packaged with the Pelicans pick, could be use to trade up to a team in the 7-9 range. 

Fast forward to draft day and the Bulls have a top three pick, and two other first rounders. Let say for the sake of this scenario, we have the #1 pick and Ayton is the consensus BPA. The five other teams in the 1-6 range (excluding the bulls), will probably not pick Porter. Teams like the Suns, Celtics / Lakers (from PHI) don't need another scoring SF in their rotation, and the Magic, Hawks, and Mav's are probably going to target other prospects due to the injury risks and the fact that Porter is probably going to go in the 5-6 range.

The Bulls trade their top 3 pick for either the 5th or 6th pick and get a future (prob 2019) first round pick (2 future firsts is another possibility) in return. We then use that 5/6 pick on Porter.

After this, we package our other two picks to trade up to the 7-9 range (this is harder / easier depending on who we trade RoLo / take bad salaries from). With this pick we grab Jackson Jr. 

We leave the draft with Porter, Jackson, and a top 5(ish) pick next draft. We get a very high ceiling player in Porter, a high floor plus decent high ceiling player in Jackson Jr. AND a great pick in next years draft (along with our own which could be a high pick as well).

Jackson Jr. fits the hoiball system perfectly and adds a nice defensive presence in the front-court alongside Lauri. Both of them can switch onto smaller players and play interior D as well. On the offensive side of the ball Jackson Jr. can stretch the floor with his 3pt shot as well as generate points on the inside when need be. Keep in mind, this is his floor projection, if he learns how to develop his own looks and improve on his passing he can easily be an all-star.

Porter profiles as a big risk big reward type of pick. If this injury doesn't derail his career, he could be the scoring catalyst of this offense and be the starting forward for the Bulls over the next decade. If injuries mess his career up, the Bulls have TWO insurance picks next draft that will probably be in the top 10 (if Porter really sucks we will have another top 5 pick).

Our starting lineup then becomes:

Dunn
LaVine
Porter
Lauri
Jackson Jr.

With 2 top 10 prospects from next year's draft as insurance (in case any of these players become terrible), bench players, or future tradable assets.

This is obviously an armchair GM opinion, but I think its somewhat possible. Please share opinions related to this timeline or your own.

Comment:

Any trade involving a lottery pick and RoLo would have to include a salary dump and maybe Nwaba (to the Cavs). The package trade to the 7-9 range could also be done with a late first, but it would have to involve other assets, it's why it'd be harder.",26,10,The Ultimate Timeline (opinion),https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/7uvnr3/the_ultimate_timeline_opinion/

"While I am certainly thrilled the Bulls were able to turn a guy they could not have traded for a leaky water cooler last Spring in to a 1st round pick but there are some strange aspects to this deal.

For one thing, a team trying to shed a bad contract like Asik will usually toss in a sweetener (like a first round pick) to convince a team to take on the extra salary and the Bulls being well below the cap coupled with the large trade exception from the Butler trade, could have easily absorbed Asik's contract and netted a first round pick without giving up Niko.

Further to this, for being a notoriously cheap organization, they went out of their way, mostly through incompetence, to spend more money getting  a 1st round pick than they really needed to.

Even if, for arguments sake, the Bulls had to give up Niko to get Asik and a 1st round pick, they signed him to a very unnecessary deal at the start of training camp that made this trade much harder to pull off and much more expensive for the Bulls.

Niko was a restricted free agent this past Summer and could have signed an offer sheet from any other team in the NBA. Niko did not sign any offer sheets and there were no reports from anyone in any form of media that any such sheets were in fact offered. The Bulls technically still had Niko under contract for the qualifying offer of around $8M for one year or they could have let him leave the NBA entirely and go back to Euro ball but I doubt anyone would have paid him $8M for the upcoming season in the Euroleague [given the largest contracts are less than half that amount per year](https://www.talkbasket.net/salaries) so it was a pretty empty threat from the Niko camp to leave the NBA and $8M on the table.

The Bulls *could* have had Niko on a 1 year deal for $8M but chose to sign him to a 1 year deal with a team option for $12.5M a year, possibly without realizing the team option granted a no-trade clause, even more problematic if they knew that was the outcome.

Fast forward to this month and Niko was almost trade to the Pelicans but it fell apart either because he was paid too much (Pels couldn't take on more salary than they sent out) or because Niko wanted his 2nd year guaranteed and vetoed the trade. In either case, *it is the direct result of the unnecessary contract they signed Niko to this past Summer that the first deal fell apart.*

Which brings us to today, and the deal went through but only because they had to add Tony Allen and Jameer Nelson to make the contract money work. 

(I'm still not sure if Niko's 2nd year was picked up or not but it's immaterial to the final tally.)

*Warning, getting a bit mathy from here on out*

The Bulls ended up paying an extra $4M in Niko's salary ($8M QO vs $12.5M deal he signed), taking on Asik's ~$10M in salary,  buying out Tony Allen and possibly Jameer Nelson's contracts at $2.3M and $2.2M and trading their own 2nd round pick for a 1st round pick they probably could have gotten for just taking on Asik's salary.

The Bulls sold a 2nd round pick for $3.5M last Summer and bought a 1st round pick for $8.5M more than they needed to spend this January.

If the Bulls do not sign Niko to that deal and he ends up taking the qualifying offer and all else plays out the same, the Bulls could have made the original trade of Niko (at $8M) for Asik (at $10M) plus a 1st round pick. 

Instead they traded Niko for $12.5 M which meant taking on an extra $4.5M in salary they did not need to if they were a more shrewd/competent general management team.

EDIT: I posted this same thing more or less word for word on /r/nba in case anyone feels like this post looks familiar

"Okay, so obviously one lacking department in the Bulls organization is scouting as shown by them not even considering Jordan Bell this summer. We need to badly expand our scouting department since we will be rebuilding from the draft. 

With our pick we should probably take:

Michael Porter Junior- Yes, he’s injured, but, if medically everything clears out we should t even hesitate. This kid is a Kevin Durant eqsue offensive player playing a position we desperately need top talent at. 

Deandre Ayton- Obviously probably the most NBA real player. Also fills a position we need at center, however it’s a long shot he doesn’t go top 2 and we probably won’t be picking that high. 

Jaren Jackson Junior- long, can shoot the three, vey good rim protection. If we fall somewhere around 7 he should definitely be a first choice. 

Who we take with our pick will obviously determine who we take with the Pels pick. So ideally we take  MPJ but if we don’t get the franchise wing we need.

Kevin Knox- Long, Atheltic, has been showing some good offensive flashes with a couple 30 point games. 

I think these 5 prospects should be the top of the Bulls scouting and make hem their top priority. Colin Sexton is also an option but with Dunn showing some flashes of being a starting caliber PG we should really be looking at SF or Cs.

Orlando - Bulls trade : Hezonja for Grant
I know people on this sub doesn't like Grant very much, and I am fully aware that most people here hate Hezonja, but I am curious what do you guys think about this...
They have similar stats this year :
Hezonja : 18 min/game, 7.4ppg, 3reb, 1ast, 46.7% FG, 34.2% 3pt
Grant : 22min/game, 8.2ppg, 2.3reb, 4.8ast, 42.4% FG, 33% 3pt

I would take this deal if we could arrange with Hezonja 1+1(team option) deal on between 6 to 8 millions per year...
Hezonja is still 22 years old, and Grant is 25 years old...
I believe Hezonja still has potential, and we could use a SF... If he plays well he could even be in starting 5 in the future, and if he is bad we get better pick and we don't have to take the team option, or he becomes a backup SF...

"GarPax is horrible at trades. Look at their recent trades, Tony Snell L, Taj/Doug L, Bell L. Their best trade is Jimmy, which is good at best. Even that trade locked us into giving Lavine whatever his agent asks, meaning we have to pay Lavine more than we were paying Jimmy, when Lavine will never be the defender Jimmy was and has an offensive ceiling of maybe being a little better on O for more money. That brings us to the Niko trade GarPax agreed to. Omer Asik is one of the worst contracts in the league. About 5 millon left on his contract this year, then 11,286,516 next year guaranteed, then 11,977,527 in 2019-2020, with 3 million guaranteed for a guy who's worse than Rolo, Markky, and Bobby and only slightly better than Felicio. Also, he's never healthy, has no jumper, and is probably gonna medically retire. Then, the Pelicans are tied for the 6th seed, up 2 games on the clippers, who are the 9th seed. But, the Clips traded Blake,and theyre probably trading Deandre and Lou as well. A clips team minus Blake, Deandre, and Lou isnt going to make 2 games up with 33 games left over a Pelicans team with Niko and Solomon Hill back. The next team is the Jazz, who are 21-28 and 6 games back of the Pelicans, and theyre not going to make up 6 games, especially since they were the Pelicans'biggest competitor for Niko. So, the Pelicans are going to bea playoff team, especially with Niko. They wouldnt have jumped into the top 5, but they wouldnt have dropped below 8. So, we would have gotten somewhere between the 15-20 pick in the draft. Currently, the Pelicans have a better record than the Sixers and the Nuggets, so theyre in a coinflip against the Blazers for the 17th pick in the draft, with the loser getting the 18th pick in the draft. So, do you think trading Niko for the 17th or 18th pick in the draft + Asik's corpse and contract is a food trade? Best case the Pelicans drop to 8th and the pick turns into 15th. Also, they could move up a little and the pick could drop to about 20th. Either way its a late-middle 1st round pick + horrible contract for Niko. GarPax sucks at trades and wont get fair value for any of our vets. At least RoLo is a traditional big pushing 30, over Niko who's perfect for the modern NBA and pushing 27.","To the trade Niko guys GarPax is horrible at trades.

Currently, the Pelicans have a better record than the Sixers and the Nuggets, so theyre in a coinflip against the Blazers for the 17th pick in the draft, with the loser getting the 18th pick in the draft. So, do you think trading Niko for the 17th or 18th pick in the draft + Asik's corpse and contract is a food trade? Best case the Pelicans drop to 8th and the pick turns into 15th. Also, they could move up a little and the pick could drop to about 20th. Either way its a late-middle 1st round pick + horrible contract for Niko. GarPax sucks at trades and wont get fair value for any of our vets. At least RoLo is a traditional big pushing 30, over Niko who's perfect for the modern NBA and pushing 27.",65,0,To the trade Niko guys,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/7u6c2e/to_the_trade_niko_guys/

"I am trying to be optimistic since he is recovering from an ACL tear, and despite it he is averaging about 24 PPG per 36 minutes, so we know the bucket-getting ability is serious.

That said, he has shown a number of serious holes in his game throughout his career that still seem to be there: namely defensive IQ, defensive effort, poor gambling skills with a high gamble rate, and a general inability to be useful when his shot isn't falling. Let me say that **almost all of this is fixable in the long-term**, but I would be wary to give someone 30+ million dollars per year if they aren't going to impact the game at a star level.

Another important note: Bulls are one of 6 teams who can even offer LaVine a max contract at all. The other options:

* **Dallas Mavericks:** who I would consider a team that might offer him a max

* **Denver Nuggets:** who are all-in on the Murray-Harris backcourt and need a wing desperately, and LaVine is not the answer there

* **Indiana Pacers:** who are more than likely not going to pursue LaVine in favor of more help for Oladipo and Turner.

* **LA Lakers:** who are 100% using that cap space on a shot at a superteam, shooting for Paul George and LeBron.

* **Philly Sixers:** a legitimate dark horse to pursue LaVine, but also unlikely as they will probably also pursue PG and LeBron as a higher priority.

**TL;DR: Zach has not exactly performed at a max contract level and there won't be much competition in the RFA market from other teams due to the never-ending aftermath of the ridiculously shitty summer of 2016 free agency.**

"With the recent injury of Kris Dunn there has been increased talk about whom among our cluster of misfit guards would be our best backup Point Guard. One such alternative stands out like a sore thumb (or foot in this case), and that would be the rarely viewed  Cameron Payne. With Payne's checkup after his surgery in September lining up well with the expected recovery time, he has been cleared for increased activity and may be well on his way to stepping onto the court for his thirteenth time in a bulls uniform (not counting SL).
 
With the small amount of games played and the low, mostly garbage-time minutes he was getting in OKC it has been hard to establish and entirely fair view of this young, injury ridden player.
 
Taking in to account how bad the trade was, and the emergence of articles with ""Sources"" claiming the bulls staff had given up on Paynes ability after just two practices, it wasn't hard to let the frustration over the trade as well as the turmoil last year spill over into hate for this young man. 
 
The memes and tank commander stuff is fun and all, but I'm getting really tired of hating on a player in a Bulls uniform, one that by all accounts hasn't show to be an asshole so far.
 
This is what this thread is about.
 

There must be something there that I'm not seeing. The dude was a lottery pick just two seasons ago, so I'd guess he did alright in college (I don't watch college ball, so those of you who do and remember seeing this dude play feel free to chip in with your opinion). Draft reports talk about a good mix of distribution and scoring as well as a long wingspan helping with defense. We haven't really seen much of either so far in the NBA, but if we're lucky then Fred can waive his magic shooting wand and help him with his struggles at least in that regards.

Our FO might not be the most renowned in the league, but they gave up a kings ransom in a trade centered around this guys as well as picked up his option to keep him here despite being out for a good chunk of the season. They must obviously see something there that I can't, and I'm hoping some of you might help me find it.

With the recent injury of Kris Dunn there has been increased talk about whom among our cluster of misfit guards would be our best backup Point Guard. One such alternative stands out like a sore thumb (or foot in this case), and that would be the rarely viewed  Cameron Payne. With Payne's checkup after his surgery in September lining up well with the expected recovery time, he has been cleared for increased activity and may be well on his way to stepping onto the court for his thirteenth time in a bulls uniform (not counting SL).
 
With the small amount of games played and the low, mostly garbage-time minutes he was getting in OKC it has been hard to establish and entirely fair view of this young, injury ridden player.
 
Taking in to account how bad the trade was, and the emergence of articles with ""Sources"" claiming the bulls staff had given up on Paynes ability after just two practices, it wasn't hard to let the frustration over the trade as well as the turmoil last year spill over into hate for this young man. 
 
The memes and tank commander stuff is fun and all, but I'm getting really tired of hating on a player in a Bulls uniform, one that by all accounts hasn't show to be an asshole so far.
 
This is what this thread is about.
 

There must be something there that I'm not seeing. The dude was a lottery pick just two seasons ago, so I'd guess he did alright in college (I don't watch college ball, so those of you who do and remember seeing this dude play feel free to chip in with your opinion). Draft reports talk about a good mix of distribution and scoring as well as a long wingspan helping with defense. We haven't really seen much of either so far in the NBA, but if we're lucky then Fred can waive his magic shooting wand and help him with his struggles at least in that regards.

Our FO might not be the most renowned in the league, but they gave up a kings ransom in a trade centered around this guys as well as picked up his option to keep him here despite being out for a good chunk of the season. They must obviously see something there that I can't, and I'm hoping some of you might help me find it.

"I had all but given up hope on a top five pick but lately the tank looks re-invigorated. After tonight we currently sit .5 games out of the 5th worst record in the league! Combine that with the inability/desire of most teams below us to get worse and you have some serious tank potential. Let’s take a quick look at the teams below us currently and our potential to lose more than them. (This is assuming we unload Niko/Rolo) 

Phoenix: the only vets they can really unload are Greg Monroe and Tyson chandler. Both guys are pretty shitty and I’m guessing they want to keep around at least one to have a veteran presence on possibly the youngest team in the league. Can’t see them getting much worse. 

Memphis: ok yeah these guys fucking suck. BUT  if Conley and Gasol stick around (Which I’d guess they will because they are so important to that franchise) and get/stay healthy, they could pull off some wins. It really all depends on how desperate they are to sell a couple of tickets the rest of the way. Otherwise they’d shut down Conley and trade Gasol. Small market so who knows. 

Dallas: this one is a no brainer. They have big money wrapped up into Harrison Barnes as well as they don’t want to be a shit show in Dirks last year. Combine that with the development of DSJ and a stable of veterans and you have a recipe for a failed tank. 

Sacramento: who knows what the fuck these guys are doing. Plenty of young talent mixed with a ridiculous amount of washed up, but somewhat talented vets. I can easily see them making a nice little run out of the cellar of the west as that funky roster gels somewhat. 

Orlando: as terrible as they have been, this team has legitimate talent. Pair that with Vogel most likely coaching for his job and you have some potential. The only vet I could see having value on that team is Fournier and losing him would help their tank. 

Atlanta: they’re 4-6 in their last ten and I have faith that Budenholzer and Schroeder will lead them to a decent record to finish out the year. They don’t have any veterans worth a shit so they won’t get much worse. 


Looking at these teams and factoring in our ability to get significantly worse at the deadline I think we are back in the tank business. Also, our front office and coach are in the rare position of having rock solid job security so they will most likely be taking steps to sabotage our chances the rest of the year. 

Basically, what I’m trying to say is that it’s time to start spanking it to Doncic highlights again. I’ll be in my bunk. ","Anyone else getting a little giddy about the tank again?

"I think I speak for everyone here when I say this team has surprised us all with it’s performance. The way things are looking now we might have gone through the fastest tank in history and be ready to compete for a playoff spot next season, so that got me thinking, should the Bulls go back and sign Rajon Rondo again next year?

This post is purely hypothetical and just for discussion’s sake, but I think this could be a really good move for the team in both the short and long-term. For starters, Rondo would instantly be an upgrade for the second unit over Grant, as he really does make everyone on the court better when he’s there by creating opportunities for guys like Bobby and Felicio. On top of that, I think his impact would reach far beyond the team’s performance for the season or two we’d have him back.

The thing that has stuck out to me the most about this team from last year to now is how much more everyone seems to gel. These guys are bought in and trust each other, they play like actual teammates instead of guys that get paid to wear the same jersey. I think Rondo deserves some credit for instilling that in some of our younger guys like Bobby and Denzel, and those two (and Niko) even said that Rondo himself was the best teammate they’ve ever had in their young careers. I believe that if we were to bring Rondo back, aside from being a great leader for the second unit, he’d also do a fine job of building on top of what already seems to be a growing positive culture. Plus, I really can’t think of many guards I’d want to help mentor Dunn into a true star. Seriously, Rondo could take Dunn’s passing ability to a whole new level, and he could even help Arcidiacono evolve into a full blown Articuno (bad joke but deal with it I’m kinda drunk).

Ultimately, this is really just my two cents on a matter that probably won’t happen, but I’m curious to see how everyone else here feels about it. Who knows, maybe if people agree and it gains some traction GarPax will hear us and make it happen.

"As the trade dead line is approaching and All-star break too, and there's less to none chance for us to make it to the playoffs...

I'm interested about trade speculations outside our veterans. And more closely, about the projected core pieces.

So what would be the return for you to make trade for these Butler-trade assets we got.

Few factors to consider about the return we'd have:

* Age of the guys to who we'd trade any/some of them (And our timeline to contend)


* Absolute level at this very moment


* Possible ceiling 


* Possible draft picks

For me, it comes more and more clear, that 


* Lauri I would trade only for around 25yo player with perennial all-star potential and that won't happen, that trade is off limits. He's shown so much and SO FAST progression so far, that before next season above stated trade possibilities would be all I'd be ready. I'd cry if he'd go for less now or summer 


* Lavine - great scorer, no doubt. Might become perennial all-star one day, but taking into consideration his ACL  injury, I'd might be ready to trade him for a high draft pick+ someone very suitable to our roster with visibly possible all-star ceiling 


* Dunn, I wouldn't give him away even if we trade point guard. Not before next season shows what he got to offer after one summer to train his offense. His athletic presence as point guard is so nice, and there are not as good defenders we probably would get from this draft class. He's the guy that I won't give away in any case this season/summer. We wonät get that kind of return for him that would be worth it. He's not been that good and isn't considered probably as highly as Lauri and Zach with their high numbers scoring ceilings.


As packages, it becomes more tough to think all the possibilities, so I didn't go there this time.","To what kind of return would you be ready to trade Lavine, Markkanen or Dunn this season? As the trade dead line is approaching and All-star break too, and there's less to none chance for us to make it to the playoffs...

I'm interested about trade speculations outside our veterans. And more closely, about the projected core pieces.

So what would be the return for you to make trade for these Butler-trade assets we got.

Few factors to consider about the return we'd have:

* Age of the guys to who we'd trade any/some of them (And our timeline to contend)


* Absolute level at this very moment


* Possible ceiling 


* Possible draft picks

For me, it comes more and more clear, that 


* Lauri I would trade only for around 25yo player with perennial all-star potential and that won't happen, that trade is off limits. He's shown so much and SO FAST progression so far, that before next season above stated trade possibilities would be all I'd be ready. I'd cry if he'd go for less now or summer 


* Lavine - great scorer, no doubt. Might become perennial all-star one day, but taking into consideration his ACL  injury, I'd might be ready to trade him for a high draft pick+ someone very suitable to our roster with visibly possible all-star ceiling

"What's most interesting to me is that Jackson actually is off the board *before* Michael Porter Jr., who goes to Cleveland (via BKN) the pick after us. I hope and pray that if we're in that situation, we take MPJ, since I think a complementary center to Lauri will be much easier to find than a gifted offensive SF. 

For those of you that don't have Insider, here's Jonathan Givony's take on Jaren Jackson and Chicago:
>""At 6-foot-11, 242 pounds with a 7-foot-4 wingspan, it's very likely that Jackson sees significant minutes at center in the NBA as his promising frame fills out, rather than at the 4 like he mostly does in college at the moment. Jackson's ability to space the floor (45 percent from 3, 81 percent from the line), block shots (5.7 per-40 minutes), switch on every screen and, increasingly, put the ball on the floor from the perimeter make him an ideal fit for the modern NBA.

>He would complement the promising Lauri Markkanen well in many ways and has significant upside to grow into as well, as he's the youngest player currently projected to be drafted.""

Edit: Decided to include MPJ's report, even though it's focused on the Cavs:
> Height: 6-foot-10 | Weight: 214

>With an uncertain future on the horizon due to LeBron James' free agency, the Cavs will need to stockpile as much talent as they can regardless of their hopes of keeping the King at home. Michael Porter came into the season with the hope of making a run at being the No. 1 pick in the draft, but unfortunately, he hasn't been able to build his case due to a back injury.

>The results of his medical examination will play a significant role in where he ultimately is drafted, but NBA teams don't appear to be overly concerned right now about the nature of the injury and his long-term prognosis.","ESPN's first full mock with DraftExpress has us picking Jaren Jackson 5th in the draft.

"**Winning Culture**: I'm not a fan of this subs encouragement of the Bulls to lose so we can fall in the standings. If we wanna build a winning culture we really can't encourage losing. You've never seen the Spurs encourage guys to lose, although to be fair that teams been good since before I was born. If you believe that this is a good draft, and the Bulls should look to sell off some of the guys nearing their prime for picks than sure. Mirotic is a prime example, because at 26 he would barely fit in the window of the championship timeline. Or Rlo who, as much as I love him, doesn't have a chance to be apart of the championship team and can be used for a pick. The Bulls are a huge organization that has the ability to sign big name free agents down the line. 




**Draft picks value:** depends on the draft class, so for example in Ben Simmons draft he was easily #1 and picks that weren't #1 had MUCH less value. In fact in the past 50 years the #1 draft pick has produced 224 All-Star seasons and 14 HOFers, while the #2 draft pick has produced 96 all-star seasons and 7 HOFers. This draft class is obviously different because there's no consensus #1 and most of the early lottery has talent. Hell people seem to forget that we got **LAURI MARKKANEN AT #7!!!!** A 7 FOOTER THAT SHOOTS 3S LIKE CURRY. 




**Good Draft History**: The front office as much as it pains me, has done a really good job these past drafts.


* 2017: *Lauri Markkanen W*:He might be like the 5th or 6th best player from the class atm but he's a 7 footer that can shoot 3s which gives him EXTREME positional scarcity & a ton of potential like Giannis,KP,or Embiid. NOTE: Cash Considerations has been doing well for Reinsdorf, I'm sure he bought his children lots of nice Lambos and Ferraris.
+ 2016:*Denzel Valentine W*: He's not that good but compared to the players who were drafted in his area he's easily the best so far.
- 2015:*Bobby Portis W* :He has been god like lately and he's only 22 making him pretty good for a selection at #22. Jury is still out on Zipser
* 2014: *Doug Mcdermott/Bairstow* **MASSIVE L**: I don't even wanna talk ab it.


Before 2014 we were contenders so the draft picks were pretty bad.



**SHORT REBUILDS**:There's also plenty of examples of **short rebuilds**. Ex: 12-13 Celtics go 41-40 commit to rebuild and trade *Pierce,Garnett,and Doc* for picks and young talent. In 13-14 they went 25-57,12th in the east,and 6th in the draft. 17-18 they're atop the east without their All-Star. Ex 2: 10-11 Rockets go 43-39 and miss the playoffs with *Yao Ming* at the end of his career the Rockets commit to a rebuild and trade prime players like *Kyle Lowry* for picks. They used these picks in a sign & trade to acquire 6moty James Harden. They rebuild around Harden and in 13-14 go 54-28. 


Hopefully this changes some of your minds on the Tank movement, I know the success of Philadelphia makes it look better than it is. I probably will be downvoted for going against the META,and that's fine as long as there's good discussion.


**TL;DR**: Encouraging the team to tank is bad. There's lots of great players in the lottery,we have a decent draft résumé,and plenty of teams have built contenders without digging deep in the lottery.

"Hey guys,

As the title states, I'm interested to hear what you'd like to get in return for Mirotic.  We don't have many assets, but I'm curious to hear what your needs are, and if any of our guys fit your rebuilding plan.  Would you take any trade that doesn't include a 1st round pick?

For Mirotic I think we'd be willing to give up Markieff Morris and a 2nd.  

For RoLo AND Mirotic, a combination of (but probably not all): Morris, Gortat, 1st, 2nd, and Satoransky.



Also, how do you rate Mirotic's defense?

Thanks!","Wiz fan here. What would you guys realistically like to get for Mirotic? (and possibly package for RoLo as well) Hey guys,

"I was giving thought to who the Bulls should go after in free agency. Moving forward we are secure at PG, SG and PF which leaves a wing and center position open. I do not believe our team should go after Boogie/PG13/IT since they are already in their primes and we want the young core to grow and learn together. Instead I think the Bulls need to look for 3 factors in adding pieces:

1) Under the age of 25 and still developing
2) Can establish contract control at a reasonable price
3) Will mesh with the system 

These factors lead me to Parker. Why?

**He will likely be available**

It has already been [established](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2739055-jabari-parker-bucks-fail-to-agree-on-contract-extension-will-become-rfa) that the Bucks are going to make him a restricted FA. Also depending on his health this year as it correlates to team success, they may decide to move on. 


**He will fit in greatly at the 3**

Since we will likely draft outside of the top 5-7 in the 2018 NBA draft, Parker may be the big, athletic wing that we have been seeking. He is 6-8 and 220lbs with good athleticism and the ability to play in the post. While he doesn't take a lot of 3s, he did incorporate them into his game last year increasing his shots from 0.5 3Pt attempts per game in 2015-2016 to 3.7 3Pt attempts per game in 2016-2017 and shooting them at a 36% clip which is slightly better than average. 

Before the injury his stats were 20.1 ppg/6.2reb/2.8 assists/1stl on 49% shooting from the field in about 33 minutes a game.He shoots the ball at an efficient percentage and has the ability to play the 3/4 at any given time. His ability to hit the open 3 while being able to score in the post should make him a great complement to both Lauri and Zach. 

**He will only be 23 entering the 2018-2019 NBA season**

He is still very young and if he is able to put his injuries behind him (BIG if), then we will have a solid core consisting of (based on this year): 

* Parker -22
* LaVine -22
* Dunn -23
* Markkanen -20
* Portis -22
* Valentine -24
* Nwaba -25
* Blakeney -21
* *2018 first round draft pick*

**Bulls have cap room and flexibility**

Talks between the Bucks and Parker fell out because he was supposedly seeking a max deal. Similar to LaVine, his play the rest of this year may determine where his market value stands during the off-season. It is debatable whether or not he and his agent will still be seeking the max (or if he's worth it), but similar to the Nets with Otto Porter, the Bulls have more than enough cap to throw him an offer that Milwaukee will be unlikely to match. For perspective, keep in mind that Andrew Wiggins, Otto Porter, Chandler Parsons, Nicolas Batum, Jrue Holiday and Harrison Barnes will all make over $24 million next season. So while a contract at or near that level would be a risk, the reward would equal a player EASILY better than those previously mentioned.  


What does everyone think? I know obviously it seems daunting particularly here in Chicago for wanting players from Simeon with multiple knee injuries, but while I fully acknowledge the risk, I think that on a reasonable deal and judging by his production last year (which was also coming off an injury) it may pay off, while fitting in the Bulls time frame. ","Free Agency 2018: Jabari Parker worth consideration? I was giving thought to who the Bulls should go after in free agency. Moving forward we are secure at PG, SG and PF which leaves a wing and center position open. I do not believe our team should go after Boogie/PG13/IT since they are already in their primes and we want the young core to grow and learn together. Instead I think the Bulls need to look for 3 factors in adding pieces:

1) Under the age of 25 and still developing
2) Can establish contract control at a reasonable price
3) Will mesh with the system 

These factors lead me to Parker. Why?

**He will likely be available**

It has already been [established](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2739055-jabari-parker-bucks-fail-to-agree-on-contract-extension-will-become-rfa) that the Bucks are going to make him a restricted FA. Also depending on his health this year as it correlates to team success, they may decide to move on. 


**He will fit in greatly at the 3**

Since we will likely draft outside of the top 5-7 in the 2018 NBA draft, Parker may be the big, athletic wing that we have been seeking. He is 6-8 and 220lbs with good athleticism and the ability to play in the post. While he doesn't take a lot of 3s, he did incorporate them into his game last year increasing his shots from 0.5 3Pt attempts per game in 2015-2016 to 3.7 3Pt attempts per game in 2016-2017 and shooting them at a 36% clip which is slightly better than average. 

Before the injury his stats were 20.1 ppg/6.2reb/2.8 assists/1stl on 49% shooting from the field in about 33 minutes a game.He shoots the ball at an efficient percentage and has the ability to play the 3/4 at any given time. His ability to hit the open 3 while being able to score in the post should make him a great complement to both Lauri and Zach. 

**He will only be 23 entering the 2018-2019 NBA season**

He is still very young and if he is able to put his injuries behind him (BIG if), then we will have a solid core consisting of (based on this year): 

* Parker -22
* LaVine -22
* Dunn -23
* Markkanen -20
* Portis -22
* Valentine -24
* Nwaba -25
* Blakeney -21
* *2018 first round draft pick*

**Bulls have cap room and flexibility**

Talks between the Bucks and Parker fell out because he was supposedly seeking a max deal. Similar to LaVine, his play the rest of this year may determine where his market value stands during the off-season. It is debatable whether or not he and his agent will still be seeking the max (or if he's worth it), but similar to the Nets with Otto Porter, the Bulls have more than enough cap to throw him an offer that Milwaukee will be unlikely to match. For perspective, keep in mind that Andrew Wiggins, Otto Porter, Chandler Parsons, Nicolas Batum, Jrue Holiday and Harrison Barnes will all make over $24 million next season. So while a contract at or near that level would be a risk, the reward would equal a player EASILY better than those previously mentioned.  


What does everyone think? I know obviously it seems daunting particularly here in Chicago for wanting players from Simeon with multiple knee injuries, but while I fully acknowledge the risk, I think that on a reasonable deal and judging by his production last year (which was also coming off an injury) it may pay off, while fitting in the Bulls time frame.

"It's become a popular opinion around here to suggest we abandon the tank and just try to win this year. It's a lot of fun to try to win, for sure, but it really isn't smart.

What do we have to gain by being good this year? Financially, fans pack the UC whether we're bad or good. In terms of fandom, we can handle not making the playoffs this year, we were prepared to watch the worst team in the league. The players might gain a bit of experience going to the playoffs, but even great players like Kevin Durant and Steph Curry went through losing seasons early in their careers. They're certainly no worse for having had the experience of losing.

What do we we have to gain by being bad this year? An excellent young player. A fourth player to add to our core. In my opinion we should draft for fit rather than ""best player on the board,"" because we already have a core, and I don't need to tell you how huge it would be to get Mohamed Bamba or Michael Porter Jr., to fill the holes in our core.

Basically, we're losing sight of our goal. That's to BE IN CONTENTION FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP. With that goal in mind, there is NO reason to try and win this year, except it might be a little fun. Do we really want to trade building for a championship for some fun this year? Robin Lopez will be 34 and Niko 32 when our core hits their primes. That's why we need to cash in on their value NOW. The Warriors are great because Steph, Durant, Klay, Draymond are in their primes at the same time. We want all our great players to be good at the same time - otherwise, they hold no value in our goal to win a championship.

**TL;DR: By trading Niko and Lopez, we could get a couple of okay picks, or a good pick and a good young player, and we'd have another asset in a high first round pick as we tanked. This game is about ASSETS, and it's about cashing in on those assets all at the same time. I don't want Dunn/Lavine/Markkanen in their primes and a bunch of old guys. I want Dunn/Allonzo Trier/Lavine/Markkanen/Bamba and, like, Aaron Holiday off the bench. Which is a conservative estimate on what we could cash Lopez and Mirotic in for, and where we could be if we committed to the tank.**

EDIT: What many if you are not realizing is that losing games is an ASSET in itself.

"So this started off as a reply to a comment in another thread but then I thought I spent way too much time at 4am to have my comment reach a total of maybe 1 person, also I did not proof read this and I'm mad tired so there might be mistakes or sentences that seem off. This is mostly in response to the idea that while the bulls have won a lot more recently, we haven't beaten the top teams


I'm loving the Bulls right now and watching them they actually play some great team basketball. I feel like we're in the weirdest place right now and I'm torn between tanking and winning but honestly I haven't been this happy about the Bulls in a while and our latest 15-8 stretch is so much better than anyone thought we'd be at the start of the season. 


While it's true our losses have mostly come from top teams, I take it to be a good thing (not the losing part so much), the team already far exceeded my expectations but then to see a team who's core consists of Dunn, Lauri and Lavine, a rookie, a sophomore and Lavine who's played a total of 4 games so far, the team still keeps it real competitive with the top teams and I think that's a positive.
We only lost by 3 to the Cavs after a 7 game winning streak, on the 2nd night of a back to back with both games being on the road, you would think that we would have no business with even being within 20 points in that game. Since then we lost to the celtics quite convincingly, but we'd beaten them before, then we lost to the wizards and trailblazers on back to back nights both by 4 points, followed by a 9 point loss to the Raptors, then we got a win over dallas before getting blown out by the pacers and then losing by 9 to the rockets 2 days later. My point is, besides the Pacers loss, these were all real close losses for the Bulls that they kept competitive against top tier teams in the midst of a tough schedule (they played 6 games in 9 days) and as for the Pacers loss, refer to this comment [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/7ontnp/post_game_chicago_bulls_1426_fall_to_indiana/dsb257w/)

Finally we lost to the Warriors, I trust that I don't need to explain how good they are, the Bulls had a bad shooting night where they shot 25.6% from 3 versus the Warriors 40% (Curry and Thompson's shooting was just insane), additionally the Bulls were outscoured 32 to 12 in the 3rd quarter, yet we still only lost by 7. It's like I already said, with our team and circumstance, we have no business going toe to toe with Goldenstate or the likes yet we had a real shot of winning any one of those games, even despite our lack of star power and our young and inexperienced team, that's why I'm still psyched about our team even when losing, it's hard to see the losses as negatives when we were expected to lose in the first place. As far as I'm concerned, the team is exceeding expectations even in losses and I see that as a positive, and with more experience and development, mistakes and inconsistencies like the 12 point quarter will be erased and it's at that point that we can win the games against the top teams too on a regular basis

"Hood is 25 years old, has shown solid potential and the jazz's interest in niko mirotic could make this a great trade idea for us. He's averaging 17 points and shooting 39% from 3.

I think hes unlikely to get a max contract given his age and talent level, if he does become too expensive, we can always let him go, unloading mirotic and positioning ourselves for a better position in the draft would still make the trade worth it.","Jazz looking to trade rodney hood, good trade idea for bulls?

"Whats up fam

So we will probably have 7-11 odds in the draft and most likely the FO is going to be looking at a wing or a center, can we assume and expect that we will draft Mikal Bridges, Miles Bridges, or Wendell Carter Jr? 

What are your thoughts on those three guys? Which one would you prefer? 

Also rumors swirling around that maybe we go for Rodney Hood, how would you feel about that? If we do end up with Hood id assume the FO would definitely be looking for a center then and theres not to many centers in the top 12 that would make sense for us except for Wendell Carter Jr

"There are not many players in this draft I would take before selecting Miles Bridges from MSU (possibly only Ayton, Doncic).

Many of the mocks have him going in the bulls possible pick range.

Am I the only one that sees how good this kid is? His per 36 stats are almost identical to Carmelo's season at Syracuse, with less steals/more blocks... Apart from the stat similarity i see a lot of similarity in their games around the rim and natural defensive ability. Bridges is a better athlete so he will be a better defender but probably will never have Melo's shot creating ability on the perimeter.

What do you guys think? Where would you put him on your wishlist for the Bulls this year?

"I was watching the game last night and I noticed how similar Dunns game was to Mike Conleys. I went and found that statistically at the age of 23 they're like clones.


Age: 23|**Kris Dunn**|**Mike Conley**|

PPG|**13.7**|**13.7**|
APG|**6.4**|**6.5**|
RPG|**4.6**|**3.0**|
FG%|**.433%**|**.444%**|
MPG|**29.6**|**35.5**|


Some important notes for this data are that **Mike Conley** was on a better Grizzlies team that went *46-36*. Compared with  **Kris Dunns'** team projected to go *32-50* this season (Via Five-Thirty Eight). Conleys USG% at 23 was 19.4% while Dunns is 25.4%. 


Dunn however, is playing much less MPG than Mike Conley, and came off the bench for a portion of the season that may be negatively skewing his stats. 


I didn't spend hours searching for a good NBA player that compares well to Kris Dunn. It was a simple comparison while watching last night that I put to the test statically. I'll admit I was the biggest haters of Dunn coming into the season given how little Minnesota thought of him, and given how BAD the front office has been. I now am repenting for my sins, and hoping that GarPax actually knew what they were doing when they made that trade and that they didn't just get lucky.

- Hoiball in action: The team made great passes, excellent movement without the ball

>No more Chipotle. Cooking home & getting food from the arena. Also mom is there right now so getting good ol’ homemade food.
>
>Biggest reason between the bad start for the season and the form now, is getting Niko back. Started to get wins which gave a major confidence boost.
>
>Beginning of January 8 games in 12 days - two and a half weeks without proper practice. 
>Weight training few days a week.
>
>Gets along great with the whole coaching staff, but brings up Jim Boylen as someone who has been important for him.
>
>Re: shooting slump and getting through it. Watched film with Hoiberg and it was all about getting back to same shooting form as in the early season. Didn’t follow through properly and leaned forward too much. ”Nothing changed, just back to basics.”
>
>One big focus point in practice for Lauri has been getting better in reading the game.
>
>Host says that he thinks Lauri’s biggest strength is in punishing close-outs, and asks what does he think. Lauri agrees that it is up there. Also says it has been getting easier during the season because in the beginning everything happened so fast.
Points out that one big thing where he needs to get better is when there is no close-out.
>
>Likes to play ball screen with RoLo. Is highly confident in his pull-up jumper.
>
>Asked about media training, says there really hasn’t been too much focus on it. ”Guess I haven’t given out too bad interviews, because no one has said anything about it.” 
>Jokes with the host how he has mostly been giving cliché answers for media and how there has been no quotes a la Draymond Green or Marcus Cousins from Lauri. Laughs it off ”Not yet, not yet. Let’s see in the future if something pisses me off.”
>
>Gets along with every teammate. Notes how it’s very different from college - not really hanging out with anyone. Highlights Holiday and Zipser as the closest to him. Sits next to Holiday on plane so chats most with him.
>As for mentors brings up Pondexter as someone who helps a lot in game related stuff. Sits next Quincy in the locker room and at every halftime and after game Quincy asks him what Lauri himself thinks is where he succeeded and what he could do better. Adds that he does same stuff with Mirotic, and RoLo helps also with his game and overall encourages Lauri.
>
>Didn’t know about the 3-point record beforehand and when asked if he cares about the said record he just replied ”Shooters gonna shoot.”
>
>Host brings up Lauri is 25 points behind former Finnish NBA player Hanno Möttölä’s record as an all-time Finnish NBA scorer and what he thinks about that. ”Hopefully I can break that at some point.” 
>Adds that obviously it’s going to be a great feeling if he can be at the top of the list, because Lauri has a huge respect for Hanno and states that Hanno played a big part in Lauri’s career and where he is now.
>
>Asked about rivalries or history with other players; brings up Dragan Bender and Porzingis. Notes that there’s no rivalry with Kristaps but enjoys playing against him and that ”He’s a really good guy.”. 
>Host brings up that early in the season against Suns he sensed from Lauri’s game and presence that Lauri felt he had Bender in his back pocket. Lauri agreed. Wanted to show off against Bender because played together at Basketball Without Borders and felt like he was at least on the same level, but Bender was MVP and Lauri just barely (if at all?) made the All-Star team.
>Also when Bender got drafted at 4th in 2016, Lauri felt like he has to go higher. Which all then resulted in that he wanted to show off his skills against Suns.
>
>Game against Knicks in MSG is the most memorable for Lauri right now. Loved to play in MSG. 
>
>Asked about biggest difficulties against Porzingis, brings up the jumpshot in the post because he’s so tall and got such a high release point.
>Feels like he does well in attacking against Kristaps from the arc, because Kristaps is so tall and maybe can’t keep up with Lauri’s speed. Emphasizes that's absolutely no disrespect to Kristaps, just thinks that he has the edge over there. 
>Adds that Kristaps has played couple of years longer in NBA and is stronger than Lauri right now, so in defense he tries to get him face-to-face because of the speed advantage.
>
>Has enjoyed every matchup. No players he doesn’t like to play against and likes to take the tougher players as a challenge.
>
>Host asks if there has been any 'aha! moments' or surprises in individual players. Says that against Carmelo he felt like I can compete against these guys here. Surprised how explosive Westbrook really is, and the biggest surprise was how physical and strong LeBron actually is, even though everyone knows that, but still a surprise when defending him.
>
>Re: Fans talking about tanking. Doesn’t care at all about the talk and speculation - players are there to win.
>
>Re: Playoff chances. Not too much talk about it. Says that obviously everyone wants to get there. Especially after the bad start everyone wants to prove doubters wrong and get to playoffs. And playoffs are Lauri’s goal also.

>Host reveals Lauri talking to him about ”UNSTOPPABLE MOVE” in the summer that he has been practicing and asks when he is planning to unleash it.

"While this sub may at times unfairly call out GarPax sometimes, I think a lot of their criticism is justified. What is really grinding my gears today is how Jordan Bell lacks basic awareness about how he landed in Golden State. Yes, the Bulls passed on him, but so did 28 other teams. But passing on him does not mean GarPax traded him– they **sold** the pick to Golden State. Golden State then decided to use that pick to draft Bell. 

If Bell wants to use how it went down as a chip on his shoulder, fine. But before putting his hurt feelings in the public realm, he should know how the hell the trade/draft sequence went down.

"The Villanova swingman is projected to go somewhere around 9th or 10th in mock drafts (as of right now). He shoots the ball well which flows with Hoiberg's offense and can play defense which flows with our high energy guys like Dunn and Nwaba. With the way our team has been looking since the 3-20 start and with LaVine now back, I don't think we'll get that top 5 pick unless we trade for it, which means our FO needs to be scouting non-lottery players. Tankathon currently has us at the 9th spot for the 2018 draft. We need a solid player at the 3 spot and this guy could fit. What does Bulls nation think?

"Want to select: 

DeAndre Ayton: I think this guy is too good to pass on, body type and skill matches that of Joel Embiid/David Robinson to me. Unfortunately, he will probably not make it pass the top 3 so our chances at snagging him with our current record are pretty slim.

Honorable Mention:

Micheal Porter Jr: The back injury does worry me, but MPJ has the body type and skill set to be successful in the league. A starting lineup of Dunn,Lavine,MPJ,Lauri Bird, and Robin Lopez (if we don't offload him before next season) would be an exciting young team. 

Think the Bulls will take:

Miles Bridges: Our current record has us floating around the 8-9 pick in the draft. Miles Bridges would be a solid pickup right here, fitting the void at the 3 position we currently have. I also like that he is very comfortable playing the 4 as well, would make us even more difficult to guard on the offensive end. His shot could use some work, the handle isn't the best either. He makes up for a lot of his shortcomings with how explosive of an athlete he is.

Trae Young: I'm torn on this. Trae Young has been sensational to watch light it up in college, however I really do like the improvement shown by Dunn this year. I almost don't want to write Dunn off, even if Trae Young is projected to be Steph Curry 2.0. I don't think the amount of trips to the foul line will be waiting for Trae Young once he is playing at the NBA level. I also don't like the defensive stopping power of a backcourt consisting of Young and Lavine...Yikes.

Honorable mention: 

Mikal Bridges: I am just starting to really watch his game, I like the defensive potential and the shooting. I think he is a bit undersized to guard 3s at the NBA level. I may be wrong, I believe Bridges has the potential to be a Donovan Mitchell level upset of this draft.

Who I am praying we don't take:

Any power forward: In all seriousness, We can call Lauri the GOAT at this point, he is our starting 4 for the foreseeable future. As much as I like guys like Jaren Jackson Jr or Marvin Bagley, I can't justify us selecting another 4. ","Who do you want to take in the draft vs. Who you think the Bulls will take?

"Tonight at the United Center was Zach LaVine bobblehead night. Everyone who came got a bobblehead of the new player returning from injuries. To most very common fans, they see the new toy as most likely the most famous star on the team so they root for him. 

The first play of the game drawn up by Hoiberg was designed to get Zach LaVine open for 3 and it worked. It was probably practiced by the team 100's of times so they could run it to perfection so they can absolutely guarantee they get him open.

Zach LaVine in the postgame interview said he ""felt loved"" making him feel very welcomed in his new town and to be loved right off the bat. See what happened to Oladipo in Indiana. He was loved immediately and he is now playing at an all star level. Drawing up a great play to get him open and doing it the first play of the game on bobblehead night in his new city. The crowd erupting as they hear his name. Giving him a huge confidence boost. First play of the game. Genius. 




Edit: heres the first play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y--8PHlZPZI&feature=youtu.be

It's a weird play cause its very unconventional and confuses the defense. Something that would have to be practiced a lot to work. In this play, Zach inbounds the ball and cuts to the basket where Holiday waits. When he gets there Holiday does this weird twirl thing and the defense switches. This gives Zach time to break away from his man when he runs past Lauri Markkanen's convenient screen. Lauri never moved from his spot the entire play. Zach gets open for a three he's practiced 100 times. Easy.","Fred Hoiberg is a very smart coach Tonight at the United Center was Zach LaVine bobblehead night.

>""Nikola Mirotic has gone from a 'solid' player to an offensive output that is comparable to Kevin Durant's. It's less than 20 games in, which is not a large sample size, but not a small one either.""


>-- Alejandro Yegros


>I'd say I'm substantially less convinced that Mirotic is truly a different player. After all, he's not yet to the 500-minute threshold, which is probably the lowest I'd use for a leaderboard, with a preference for 1,000 minutes. Moreover, much of Mirotic's improvement has been driven by shooting, particularly 3-point shooting, which is the noisiest player stat.


>Mirotic's increased usage rate is more likely to sustain. He's gone from finishing 19.8 percent of the Chicago Bulls' plays with a shot, turnover or trip to the free throw line in 2016-17 to 27.8 percent so far this season -- far better than his career high of 22.8 percent. But typically, such changes produce worse efficiency; Mirotic is also posting a career-high true shooting percentage of .627, largely on the strength of career-best 46.3 percent 3-point shooting.


>Second Spectrum data confirms that Mirotic taking more shots has meant taking harder ones. His quantified shot quality -- the effective field-goal percentage we'd expect an average player to post on the same shots, given location, type and the location of the nearest defender -- has dropped from 51.7 percent in 2016-17 to 49.8 percent this season. (Mirotic's actual eFG has gone up from 51.0 percent to 60.6 percent.) And again, most of the discrepancy has come on 3s.


>I suspect Mirotic is a better 3-point shooter than his 35.0 percent career mark entering this season, but I doubt he'll be able to sustain 46 percent shooting, particularly at this level of usage.","Kevin Pelton is skeptical about Mirotic's present production.

"I'm wondering what everyone thinks on the potential trade including Niko and the Jazz. I've heard a lot of moves involving Favors, Hood and their 1st round pick. Even though I get that at this point we HAVE to move Niko, I personally am not the biggest fan of what Utah can give back to us... Hood is solid but we don't really have any need for another SG (especially given his contact situation) and Favors is the same age as Niko but not as good of a shooter. Their first rounder, even though it'll be in the 7th-12th rate, is definitely appealing but I still feel as if we could get a better pick from a title contender (Cavs-Nets Pick, Celtics-Lakers Pick maybe...) or a team in need of a solid shooting big man. I'm not against the Jazz trade but I'm just wondering if anyone thought the same thing or why getting Hood/Favors and a pick would be our best case scenario.

Correction: Forgot to mention Alec Burks who has also been involved in some trade talks","Thoughts on Niko to Jazz I'm wondering what everyone thinks on the potential trade including Niko and the Jazz.

"Part 1 of this post regarding Western Conference subreddits is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/7opale/i_went_through_other_team_subreddits_to_evaluate/). I was approaching the character limit so I broke it up into two parts. Here's what the Eastern Conference subreddits had to say about Mirotic:

***

*/r/AtlantaHawks*: No discussion about Mirotic, but why would they? They're undefeated!

***

*/r/bostonceltics*: One post about Niko from about a month ago. They all seem to think he sucks, but you know how it goes. Fuck the Celtics.

***

*/r/GoNets*: [One post from two months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/7931ns/deal_for_nikola_mirotic/) reveals their sub thinks he's garbage, but [a post from 10 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/7opale/i_went_through_other_team_subreddits_to_evaluate/) includes Niko as ""the top of their wish list"". No trade ideas are mentioned.

***

*/r/CharlotteHornets*: Yet [another post with a bunch of replies stating Niko is garbage](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/7bv2qx/mirotic/), and that he apparently can't play either the 3 or 4, is a terrible defender, and that Kaminsky is already better. The Hornets fans are a homerish bunch but this is just ridiculous.

***

*/r/clevelandcavs*: No talks at all. Not too surprising, I guess.

***

*/r/DetroitPistons*: The first post is [another post detailing how much they hate him](https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitPistons/comments/7jv8p6/what_do_you_guys_think_about_nikola_mirotic/) and would never entertain the idea of trading for him. There are some dissenters that think he can play at the 4 with Tobias at the 3 but most are not happy with the idea. [The second post about Niko](https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitPistons/comments/7bpkpy/nikola_mirotic/) offers the delicious package of just Jon Leuer. How appetizing.

***

*/r/pacers*: No discussion at all about Niko, which is surprising given how much they post over there.

***

*/r/heat*: Nothing internally discussed, [but I posted something there about an hour ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/heat/comments/7op122/bulls_fan_here_is_miami_interested_in_niko_mirotic/) because I was curious. They don't seem to know what position Niko plays, and the only offer I got was just Dion Waiters.

***

*/r/MkeBucks*: There has been a lot of Niko buzz over in Bucksland, most of it stemming from the dozens of internal discussions they have about Lopez over there (I think we could legit get Thon from them, but that's a story for another day). Here are some packages I've seen:

* MIL receives: Niko Mirotic

* CHI receives: John Henson

Listen, Henson has been playing pretty well recently but this is a terrible idea. I once watched him warm up in Milwaukee and he made about 10/30 hook shots with no defender on him. He's paper-soft and commanding $10.5M for the next 3 years. 

* MIL recives: Niko Mirotic

* CHI recives: Rashad Vaughn, Mirza Teletovic.

This is absorbing a ton of cap for a guy that might be medically retiring soon because of blood clots. That means the best case scenario in this trade is a straight up swap for Vaughn, who is utterly awful.

While the trade ideas they have are not great, they do really like him over there and they like RoLo even more. Expect more buzz as the trade deadline approaches.

***

*/r/NYKnicks*: No discussions about Niko. Their frontcourt is pretty packed as is so that's not too surprising.

***

*/r/OrlandoMagic*: A few posts, but they don't seem to like him much either.

***

*/r/sixers*: No recent discussions about Niko. They have Saric, Holmes and Joel so that's probably to be expected.

***

*/r/torontoraptors*: Here's some crazy information: [they think WE'D say no to a Mirotic-Valanciunas swap](https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/7njxn6/we_need_to_trade_jv/ds2do00/). They have discussed Mirotic a fair bit as of late, and they have always liked him. I remember they discussed trading Ross for him a few years back when Ross was actually good. Toronto definitely have both the young assets and desires to win now to pull it off. As of right now though, the community has not come up with any ideas outside of a Valanciunas swap.

*** 

*/r/washingtonwizards*: Okay, check this shit out:

* WAS receives: DeMarcus Cousins, Nikola Mirotic

* CHI receives: Marcin Gortat, Ian Clark, 2018 WAS 1st

* NO recives: Bradley Beal

This is fucking insanity and I'm not sure that a late-ish first and a throwaway guard really make up for the absorbtion of a 35-year-old Gortat contract for two more years. But I thought it was hilarious and you all should see it.

I do think Washington will be more active in talks as the deadline approaches, though. They have two large contracts to dump (Gortat and Mahinmi), a young stud in Kelly Oubre Jr., and all of their picks. They also seem to really like Robin over there. Just something to keep in mind.

***

***CONCLUSION:***

While the East was certainly much harsher about Niko than the West, here is a shortlist of all of the packages that other teams think to be equivalent to Niko's value:

* Jonas Valanciunas

* Derrick Favors

* Dragan Bender, MIL protected 2018 1st, MIL protect 2018 2nd

* Moe Harkless, POR 2018 1st, and maybe Noah Vonleh too

* Marcin Gortat, Ian Clark, 2018 WAS 1st

*/r/memphisgrizzlies*: A pretty interesting one as follows:

* CLE receives: Tyreke Evans, James Ennis, Mario Chalmers (3 expiring vets)

* MEM receives: Jae Crowder, Niko Mirotic, Derrick Rose, CLE 2018 1st, NOP 2018 2nd via CHI

* CHI receives: JaMychal Green

I like the commitment to hit the reset button by Memphis ([the post goes into later details about Conley and Gasol trades as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/memphisgrizzlies/comments/7jozhe/the_grizzlies_are_tanking_effectively_while_not/)), but this is before both Tyreke and Niko ever played a game this season. In a new trade proposal, we'd definitely be getting more value back. Niko and a 2nd for Green is backwards in terms of value. I'll probably post there asking about it sometime soon.

***

*/r/timberwolves*: One post with a bunch of nos, which is understandable as they have Dieng and Bjelica.

So this is basically Niko for Bender, a very good shot at a mid-to-late first, and a coin flip at a second. [The few that mentioned the trade idea in the thread were cautiously positive about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/suns/comments/7jv5yw/changes/), probably because Phoenix is literally swimming in first-round picks. Another big reason is that Phoenix already has the young talent, and needs to start amassing vets to build a winning culture, and they can no longer rely on a half-dozen project players' development if they want to keep Booker happy. I'd be very happy with this trade should GarPax explore it.

*/r/ripcity*: [One post with a TON of ideas for packages in it from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/7oeyef/nikola_mirotic_has_requested_a_trade_are_we_in_a/). Here's the big one:

* POR receives: Niko Mirotic

* CHI receives: Noah Vonleh, Moe Harkless, POR 2018 1st

People in the thread were mixed about it, but we'd need to add another player to match salaries anyway so maybe they'd be more willing if we threw in, say, Holiday. Vonleh is a stretch big with upside to replace Niko in the rotation, and Harkless is a good SF that desperately needs a change of scenery and fills an immediate need. A first is just gravy.

There were a few others but they were all pretty majorly lopsided in Portland's favor. They also expressed a lot of interest in Nwaba and had a lot to say about ""leverage"". I think the Nurkic trade has them a bit excited to swindle someone again.

It's worth noting that the Portland sub has discussed this a LOT. They love Niko over there and see him as a full-time PF of the future. Harkless and a first is the usual proposed package.

*/r/kings*: Nothing, which makes sense as they are rebuilding and want to lose.

*/r/UtahJazz*: [One post with a ton of Niko hate](https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/7jt0i5/mirotic_trade/), but there was one very small tossed-around idea with no comments or votes:

* UTAH receives: Niko Mirotic

* CHI receives: Derrick Favors

Favors is resurging as a center and with Gobert on the roster they can't afford to pay him as he's effectively a backup when the Jazz are healthy. This is a really, really interesting idea if we also unload Lopez (which seems inevitable).

*/r/UtahJazz*: [One post with a ton of Niko hate](https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/7jt0i5/mirotic_trade/), but there was one very small tossed-around idea with no comments or votes:

* UTAH receives: Niko Mirotic

* CHI receives: Derrick Favors

Favors is resurging as a center and with Gobert on the roster they can't afford to pay him as he's effectively a backup when the Jazz are healthy. This is a really, really interesting idea if we also unload Lopez (which seems inevitable).

***

This post is getting long as hell, so I'll split it up into a second part for the Eastern Conference. Hope this was a bit illuminating about Mirotic's interest among other teams' fanbases and what the public generally sees as his value.",42,274,I went through other team subreddits to evaluate the trade market for Niko. Here's what I found from the Western Conference teams.,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/7opale/i_went_through_other_team_subreddits_to_evaluate/

"What do you guys think? Do you think Lauri could fit at small forward? When you watch him play it's clear he isn't a true 7 footer, he's looks more like 6'10''. It seems like his perimeter/post defense isn't as bad as everyone thought it would be coming out of the draft, plus he's shown a decent amount of athleticism and ability to stay in front of his man. Not to mention his offensive game works from anywhere on the court.  Personally I'd like to see some lineup experiments akin to Vogel putting Aaron Gordon at the 3 with Niko starting at the 4.

"Everyone loves a share-everything offense when it's working, but at the same time when the clock winds down or the team reaches the end of the quarter, half, or game it's great to have a closer, someone who can reliably score or draw multiple defenders and get the ball to the open man.  If the closer tries to do to much, or actually has to do too much, that can also be a problem.  Championship teams have at least two players who can play the role of closer, often three.  And convincing stars to share the ball is the pleasant burden of coaching a contender.

But the Bulls have no closers.  They have a surprising number of players with promise, but in close games the ball is in the hands of Kris Dunn, who is improving but is not yet a star.  So when the clock winds down, or the quarter winds down, or the game winds down, they just don't always seem to get good shots.

"As you all know Robin is currently our caveman. Great hard-working player that gives it his all day after day and looks like a caveman. Before Robin we had Joakim: hard-working player that gives it his all and looks like a caveman. One thing about these players is that they are fan favorites because of how they inspire others through hard work and cleaning the offensive glass. Unfortunately, if Robin is traded we have no cavemen left and that makes me sad. Although Cameron Payne looks the part he can't play the part of the caveman. Nwaba plays the part but he is too pretty to be the caveman. Who else is there in the NBA? Steven Adams could pass for it but he isn't a realistic option to pull from OKC.

I think it would be a good idea to trade for all the Sixers second rounders in this draft to acquire as many cavemen candidates to fight in a Battle Royale to see who lands the spot next year. Either that or we find a way to merge Cameron Payne and David Nwaba into a single life-form. Thoughts?","If Robin is traded who is going to be our caveman?

Cleveland - bulls trade :
Bulls receive  Tristan Thompson, Shumpert, Žižić and nets pick
Cleveland receive Robin Lopez, Nikola Mirotić, Holiday and bulls future 2nd round pick , 2018 NO 2nd round pick

Why cleveland makes the deal : they get rid of TT and Shump (I heard that they are trying to trade these two), They get Mirotić who is playing great lately and is a good stretch 4 and who could play very good next to Lebron, and they get a solid experieced center that could help them in playoff, and they get Holiday who also is a solid 3pt shooter...

Why bulls do it : Nets pick obviously, and solid young center in Žižić


Phoenix - Bulls trade :
Phoenix receive : Mirotić, Grant and NO 2nd round pick...
Bulls receive : Bender, Dudley and their 17th pick

Why Phoenix do it : they get a decent backup PG, a good 3pt shooter in Niko, and a pick (they might want to get rid of Dudleys contract)
Why Bulls do it : We get Bender as a good project player as a center who can shoot 3pt, Dudley can play as SF, and a solid 17th pick (Miami pick)

Utah Jazz - Bulls trade :

Utah Jazz receive :  Mirotić
Bulls receive : Alec Burks(or Joe Ingles), Jazz 1st round pick

Why Jazz do it : They get a good 3pt shooter in Niko and get rid of one of those contracts
Why Bulls do it : They might get a late lottery pick


Charlotte Hornets - Bulls trade :
Hornets receive : Mirotić, and a NO 2nd round pick
Bulls Receive : Michael Kidd Gilchrist and Hornets 1st round pick

Why Hornets do it : They get rid of MKG contract and get a good shooter
Why bulls do it : Hornets pick

Portland Bulls trade :
Portland Trail Blazers receive : Zipser, Mirotić, Felicio
Bulls receive : Portland 1st round pick, Future 1st round pick (lottery protected), Evan Turner, Al-Farouq Aminu

Why Portland do it : They get rid of Turner big and long contract and get Mirotić who would get along well with Nurkić, McCollum and Lillard
Why Bulls do it : We get rid of Felicio contract and get picks

Lakers -Bulls trade : (this one would happen only if Lakers decide to decline Mirotić team option to attract star player next year)
LA Lakers receive :  Mirotić, Valentine, Holiday
Bulls Receive : Luol Deng, Ivica Zubac, Kuzma, Future 1st round pick (protected)

Why Lakers do it : Get rid of Deng contract, get a solid shooters in mirotić and Holiday, and a good prospect in Valentine
Why Bulls do it : They get former bulls as a veteran presence, Kuzma as a great prospect on SF, project player in Zubac, and a future pick


Maybe some or all of ideas are too optimistic, but I would like to see how you all feel about this... I hope to see a good discussion, what would you change, would you do any of the trades, if they are not realistic, why is that...

"**On what a playoff qualification would mean:** I mean…look, it’s a bad thing in the sense that the Bulls aren’t equipped to win a seven-game series against almost any Eastern playoff team, so making the playoffs is kinda bleh, even though it does point to great progress from the young players.
And they won’t be [equipped] for while, not unless we luck into a great draft pick. I don’t mean great as in high; I mean great as in a quality player. Obviously, your chances of that decrease as your pick drops, yadda yadda. I think there are still some guys in the later lottery discussion that could fill the small forward gap in Chicago, but Doncic is my number one and honestly, Porter is my #2 in terms of pure fit. The back injury scares me a fair bit, but if he drops a certain distance, I feel very comfortable taking him. 

**On whether the Bulls have a true #1 guy yet:** Lauri is good. I have sincere doubts that, in this era of basketball, he can ever become the number one guy. Lauri is Love, LaVine is Kyrie. Neither of those guys pulls Cleveland to three straight Finals without a true franchise guy. No, I’m not expecting Doncic or Porter to be LeBron. I’m just expecting them to be a convincing number one. And look, maybe we pull a 2016-17 Boston and draft a complementary player like Kevin Knox this year and LaVine becomes our IT. I’m okay with that. That’s a good team! And it’s a team that works with Fred’s strengths and is modern enough to play with any other Eastern team. A few things fall your way and you’re in the ECF, maybe the Finals.

**On LaVine’s return:** LaVine is still so murky to me. I have to see him as the number one option before I can really make any decision about his ceiling. KAT (and Wiggins, though to a lesser extent) had killer gravity that made it easier for LaVine to accomplish things. That said, he’s got a good release and underrated footwork as a jump shooter. Hardly anyone is explosive enough to stay in front of him for 24 seconds. My biggest fear, though, is that LaVine breaks the pass-heavy offense with bullshit ISO. Honestly, this team overachieves because there’s no reliance on a single player. There’s no one guy to defer to in clutch moments. That means that opposing defenses struggle to plan for a late-game inbounds play or half-court offense. Bulls players are trying to find the best shot, not the best player. I just hope that the pass-happy attitude remains contagious even when the Bulls find themselves with a “number one” option. Because that’s been the best thing about this team so far.","I had a conversation with a few fans of different NBA teams about if the Bulls making the playoffs/continuing to win was good or bad.

"When do we begin to worry that he just isn't that great of a shooter? I dont see him as a pure or streak shooter as he never really gets in a good rhythm where he can't miss (even in his good games).  Pretty much every 3 pointer he takes feels like it has at best a 33% chance  to go in. 

I do think he can be better though, he seems to be just chucking whenever he has any space at all which is almost all the time as its very hard to block him.  So he takes so many contested 3's which he seems to struggle greatly with.  At the start of the year when he was shooting well(and taking less shots) he wasn't chucking and was taking almost all uncontested or lightly contested shots.

"Hey everyone, since we're all of a sudden an Eastern Conference powerhouse I thought it might be helpful to think about prospects in the 5-10 range in case Zach's return keeps us rolling for the rest of the season. One prospect that really stood out to me was Kevin Knox out of Kentucky, right now projected to go between 8 and 10 in most mocks. He's 6'9, 205, plays SF/PF and is known for his shooting and defensive versatility, averaging about 16 and 6 on another talented Wildcat team. He may not have quite the offensive polish of a Michael Porter Jr just yet, but is an excellent athlete and young for his class too. He's had just about every high school award there is, and has been likened to a young Paul George by other scouting sites. IMO he'd be an ideal fit if we were to pick around 7 or 8, and honestly seems to be flying under the radar given how Kentucky's been underperforming this year. If you add him to a foundation of Dunn, LaVine, and Lauri, I think we have a very modern, athletic and switchable young core to build from. What do you all think?

"Let me preface this with saying I was totally on board with the tank. The thought of having a choice between Porter, Doncic, Bagley or Ayton had me excited for every loss, but as you all know...something changed. This team competes and they play to win and winning they are. However, with all this winning comes sacrifice. That top 4 pick we thought we'd surely be eyeing come
June is suddenly looking dim. So, should we be worried about falling from those top lottery spots? Does it even matter if we pick top 4? Let's take a look...

Over the last three seasons the conference finals have seen eight different teams compete:


Golden State

Cleveland

Boston

SanAntonio 

Toronto

OKC

Atlanta

Houston



The purpose of this post is defending the tank versus defending a competing team that may likely fall out of the top four in the draft. Let's take a look at these conference finalists and the draft position of some their key players.



Golden State: Steph(7), Durant(2)*, Klay(11), Dray(35)

Cleveland: LBJ(1)*, Kyrie(1), Love(4)*

Boston: IT4(60)*, Bradley(19), Horford(3)*, Crowder(34)*

SAS: Kawhi(15), LMA(2)*, Pau(3)*, Parker(28)

Toronto: Derozan(9), Lowry(24)*, Valenciunas(5)

OKC: Durant (2), Westbrook(3), Adams(12)

Atlanta: Milsap(47)*, Teague(19), Korver(51)*, Carrol(27)*

Houston: Harden(3)*, Howard(1)*, Ariza(43)*, Montiejunas(20)



Let us also take a look at recent All-Stars...


Giannis(15)

Buckets(30)

Paul George(10)

Kemba(9)

M. Gasol(48)

G. Hayward(9)

D. Jordan(35)

Boogie(5)


*denotes player was acquired through trade of free agency.

Edit: italics denotes player was acquired through trade or FA



As you can see, it's kind of a mixed basket. Golden State built a dynasty with the top pick being seventh and acuiring solid free agents such as Iggy, Livingston and Durant(fwiw). Cleveland is a weird one, their core is two number ones and a number three that they acquired for a two number ones. Outside of Cleveland, Houston is the only team to advance to a conference finals with the help of a top pick (Dwight). It obviously helps when you can land a generational talent such as Harden, but that's what good GM's do.

All in all, I feel that having a top four pick is helpful in reaching our goal of becoming a contender but it is by no means absolutely necessary. We'll likely still pick top ten if I was a betting man and who knows, maybe some of our vets can help us net another lottery pick. Building a contender is done through a combination of high picks, good scouting and a good GM. The verdict is definitely still out on that last need, but maybe this last summer was a bit of redemption.

I say we all jump off the tank, cheer for the wins, watch our pieces develop and hope that a core of Dunn, Lauri, Lavine and a pick between 5-12 is enough to get us back to the toppermost of the poppermost.

But now we have developing players buying into the system, hoiball has taken over. On top of that, our defense has been outstanding and we are a super young team. 

With hoiberg getting the respect of Brad Stevens, it's imperative we keep him. He has surely grown as a person, after altercations with rondo and Butler probably everyday. And c'mon that hoiberg dance video

I was curious what other Bulls fans think of this paring? Especially since this last win streak lessens our chance for a top 3 pick. ",33,51,"OKC Native, Bulls Fan, homies we want Trae Young",https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/7lx8xf/okc_native_bulls_fan_homies_we_want_trae_young/

"Hey guys! So here's a mini-story. 

My dad has been a die-hard Bulls fan since the 70s. When my older sister was born, he was watching the game in the 1993 Finals against the Suns, and almost dropped her out of celebration when John Paxson hit **the shot.**

So every year, for Christmas, we always talk about going to a Bulls game together. He's been to a few, but none since Rose was here. I've been to quite a few, none this year yet. I always tell him I don't want him to spend that type of money on me. We hadn't been the most financially stable growing up. 

Well, earlier this year I moved out, finally being able to afford moving out and living on my own! Some of you may know my struggles over the past few years. Back in 2014, I was hit by a car and almost died. Broke my neck, back, got concussed, partially collapsed lung along with many other injuries. 

I had to quit my two jobs and I had to drop out of school full-time. Ever since then, life has been rough. I've been working so hard the past three years to make myself financially stable (paying off medical bills and college tuition etc). It's been a long hard road, filled with bumps and depression.

This year, for Christmas, I bought me and my dad tickets to go see the Bulls face the Mavericks on March 2nd at the *UC*. It will be our first Bulls game together, and I couldn't be fucking happier. I can't wait to see his face when he opens his gift and sees that we will be sitting *right behind the Bulls bench, too!* 

Merry fucking Christmas, and **SEE RED**!!!","Holiday Season, want to share something exciting (for me) Hey guys! So here's a mini-story.

"So now we're 30 through the season and we've seen some potential from our team. The Jimmy trade so far seems like a win win for both teams. We got three players with potential for the future, and the T-Wolves got a player to aid their win-now mentality. Fred seems like he might not be a terrible coach, but the type of coach that needs specific players in both style and mentality to succeed(struggles with established veterans). Niko has seemingly figured something out to become the player he was supposed to be and Bobby has also improved to the point where he looks like he can be a great bench piece. What do you guys think of the idea of a one year tank, we keep this team's core pieces together(Lauri, Zach, KD, Niko, Bobby), everyone else is expendable for the best pieces we can get(RoLo being the number one asset). We do something to ensure that we still are one of the worst teams this year(bringing back Zach very slowly, trading RoLo, mysterious ""injuries"" pop up for Niko and Bobby). We get a top 5 pick, which we use to pick a potential superstar, no matter the position, and then next year start trying to build a winning squad, no tanking. 

I feel like any of either Zach, KD, Lauri, Niko, plus whoever we pick with our hopeful top five pick, have all-star potential, and if one makes the leap to top 10-15 player(Zach, Lauri, or whoever we pick in the draft) then that's our path to contending. Obviously this squad wins nothing for 1 or two years, but after growing together for a year, players like Niko, Zach, and KD will then be in their primes or right around there, and I believe in building a winning mentality, and growing a team together for a few years, is the best way to build a contender. If anything the problem with that possible squad is too many cooks in the kitchen, too many players who will want the ball in their hands. Obviously Lauri isn't the type of player who needs the ball all the time, and I'm hopeful one of Niko or Zach can become an elite three point shooter.

So overall how do you guys feel about this idea? Do you feel this is our best path to championship contention, keeping this core together and then hopefully adding a top pick, or do you feel that trading as many players as possible to get more picks, and still tanking next season also is the best method. Excited to see some discussion and hear some ideas.","[Serious] How do you guys feel about the idea of a 1 year only tank?

"Serious question but how does everyone feel about GarPax right now? Yes we were all mad about the Butler trade, and the cash considerations we chose over what turned out to be Draymond Green 2.  But I love the direction we're headed, and I hate to say it...it's thanks to GarPax.   

Kris Dunn and Lauri Markannen alone have already made up for the loss of Butler.  We have LaVine coming back in less than a month or so, Niko/Portis we could either use for trades or to give us a solid bench mob, David Nwaba and Justin Holiday who we got for practically nothing and they're contributing, we have tons of cap space, PLUS we'll most likely nab a top 5 pick in the lottery.

Personally I want the young guys playing in meaningful games and developing good, focused habits. So for me win as much as possible, its good for morale.

"* Kris Dunn has got his fingerprints all over this current Bulls offense. Fred has turned him into a floor general. He's increased assists and decreased turnovers. He's an improved shooter. (BOUNS: [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/timberwolves/comments/6j0uwv/what_should_bulls_fans_expect_from_kris_dunn/) to a thread from the off-season in r/Timberwolves about what to expect from Kris this season)

* David Nwaba is non-stop grind. I can't wrap my head about how hungry this guy must be. Phenomenal rebounder, exceptional defender and an incredibly reliable guy in transition. We picked him up dirt cheap and he is looking low-key like one of the free agent steals of the off-season.

* Niko is at an all-time high in terms of trade value. He's put on strength, become a solid defender and is expanding his game into the post. He might not be here too much longer, so enjoy this while you can.

* Bobby bitch is fierce af. His jumper looks wet, his low-post game and strength are on display constantly AND, maybe most importantly, he is an improved defender. There was a moment just before half-time where Robez and Niko were subbed out for Zipser and Bobby to play the last defensive possession. Considering RoLo and Mirotic are two solid NBA defenders, that's saying something.

* Hoiberg is doing good things with this offense and in finding guys minutes in the rotation. I don't think we can argue that anyone isn't getting enough minutes within our offense. He's taken a total garbage team that has no business winning games on a five-game winning streak. He's tweaked our offense to help Lauri find mismatches and better scoring opportunities and help Dunn find his stroke.

* Last but not least, RoLo. He deserves to soak in every bit of this streak. He shouldn't have to stay on as part of the tank, and I don't feel like we deserve such a high-character guy mentoring our young guys. He consoled Kris on the bench today after he fouled out, he was hyping up Niko after his clutch three today, he was giving Bobby advice from the baseline during free throws AND he's a great player.","Chicago Bulls appreciation thread * Kris Dunn has got his fingerprints all over this current Bulls offense.

"Non-bulls fan here, New Yorker and Knicks fan. But sports betting has caused me to watch tons of bulls game this season. I gotta say this has got to be the comeback team of the season so far.

"This, like most draft related posts, is purely hypothetical and only meant to spur discussion. I’m not GarPax and have no control over what they do, but I’ve been thinking about this scenario lately.

The thing I have absolutely no fucking clue about is what we add to that because all of my NBA trade experience is limited to fucking over computer GMs in 2k and I think they might be a little smarter in real life.

When does it become too much from our end, or is giving up our 2019 first bad enough?

"
Here is my thought out in-depth analysis: Long read.

The objectives should be, in order of importance:

**1) Develop Markkanen, Dunn and LaVine.** However, this can be done to varying degrees, and does not require that you play 8th seed playoff basketball to do it. You can lose a ton and give these guys a ton of minutes to develop. But these three guys are already known-quantities as high level prospects. You can't be sure a third overall pick or a fifth overall pick or even a first overall pick will be as good as a Markkanen or LaVine, so these three assets are really more important than your own first. You could probably argue Dunn, and to a lesser extent LaVine, but Markkanen is definitely more important than your 2018 first round pick.

**2) Get as high a draft pick (and as many draft picks) as possible while accomplishing Objective #1.** You can' t sabotage the developments of the three aforementioned pieces just to get the #1 overall pick. LaVine has to come back and play. Markkanen and Dunn have to develop chemistry. Etc. However, certain players are expendable and not important to developing Dunn/Markkanen/LaVine.


**3) Clear as much cap space as possible to enable you to sign as many impact free agents as possible before Dunn/Markannen/LaVine need big contract extensions.** Self-explanatory. I'm not having any delusions of Lebron coming here, but DeMarcus Cousins is a free agent, isn't he? So is Chicago native and 20 ppg scorer Jabari Parker.

**4) Develop and keep as many future supporting pieces as possible to supplement your core (#1), while not harming objectives #2 or #3 too much.** This means, for example, that Bobby Portis is a really nice backup center that you'd love to have on a contending playoff team, for when you get there. Try to keep him, but if he's hurting the tank, he's expendable. Same can be said of Niko.... but it doesn't mean he automatically needs to be traded, because again, he's a young, valuable supporting piece.

............

My analysis of how to accomplish those four goals would be to go about it in this order:

1) The first piece that needs to go is Lopez. He's not a part of the future. He's expensive. And not having him leaves a gaping hole at center that will allow us to lose some games. Trading him clears out minutes for Markkanen (objective #1) but also helps us lose games (#2) and frees up space for the offseason FA period (#3). He might hurt #1 a little because he's not around to be a veteran presence for the young guys, but he's not the same style player as Markkanen, so I'm not sure how much he can tutor him anyway. Trade him.

2) Felicio is the next piece that should go. Portis is more valuable as the long term backup big man. Portis is better and, for now, cheaper. I don't even know why Felicio was re-signed to this deal. See if you can move him along with Lopez, maybe. I'd trade away a second round pick just to get rid of this contract, frankly, to accomplish objective #3. This will also help weaken front court depth so as to be an Achilles heel for the Bulls this season, resulting in losses.

3) See if you can find takers for Holiday, Payne, or Grant. I'll take seconds or expirings. Just want to clear off their cap hits for next year and weaken our depth this year, helping with Objective #2 and #3. 

4) The Mirotic and/or Portis decision. This is the tricky part. Firstly, you have the question as to whether these guys can co-exist long term. If no, one of them has to go, period. Mirotic seems like the better option to ship out, as he's more expensive (helps objective #3) and since he's so hot right now, he's hurting #2. He could also bring back a significant asset, perhaps, which I'll say adding draft picks goes towards helping Objective #2 also.

If they can co-exist, then you have to analyze them in context of #2 and #3. Frankly, I think, despite Mirotic's cap hit of $12.5m, the Bulls are in excellent position if they can move the other names I already discussed. They currently only have $46m committed next year. Subtracting Lopez (14.3), Felicio ($8.4), and even one of Grant/Holiday/Payne (I'll go with the mean... $3), gives the Bulls only $21m committed, plus cap holds. The cap is supposed to be nearly $100m, yes? The Bulls will be able to give out two max deals plus fill-in contracts if that is the case. There is no need to move out Mirotic to create cap space if Lopez/Felicio/others are moved. In fact, you probably do not find a more impactful use of Mirotic's $12.5 million other than on Mirotic himself.

So the question becomes, does Mirotic hurt the tank by keeping him around? Well..... yes and no. My hope is more no than yes. I would hope that by dealing Lopez, Felicio, and some depth, the Bulls hurt themselves enough that Mirotic can stay. Do they end up with the worst record in the league? No, they probably do not, if Mirotic is here. But do they fall outside the top 3-4 worst records? Maybe they don't. If they have the 3rd worst record instead of the worst record, is that really the end of the world? As pointed out earlier, the odds of getting the first overall pick are already only 25% if you have the worst record. If you have the third worst record, your odds are only slightly worse. I might rather have Mirotic and a 18% chance of the first overall pick rather than no Mirotic and a 25% chance at the first overall pick. Especially in a year where there is no Lebron or Durant at the top. Instead, we are in a year where Doncic at 3 might actually be better than Bagley at 1. 

The only other consideration is, what can you get for Mirotic? If some team was offering a top 8 pick for him, well, then that throws all the other analysis out the window. You want that pick, plus the added benefits of helping the tank and clearing up cap space. But if you are only getting a pick in the 20's, that's a crapshoot even to be an NBA quality backup. I'd rather keep Mirotic.

Now, if the Bulls start winning too much.... if they go on long win streaks, and look like they are threatening to get outside the top 5 picks.... then you have to consider moving Mirotic just to facilitate the tank. Once you get outside those top 5 picks, the draft becomes too much of a crapshoot, despite us finding Markkanen at 7 last year. Can't guarantee that, and it's just unarguable that the best odds are in the top 3 or top 5. 

**TL;DR -** Hopefully this win streak ends ASAP, they find buyers for Lopez and Felicio, and Portis and Mirotic go back to getting along and playing losing basketball. That's the best case scenario.","Best case scenario for the Bulls? 
Here is my thought out in-depth analysis: Long read.

The objectives should be, in order of importance:

**1) Develop Markkanen, Dunn and LaVine.** However, this can be done to varying degrees, and does not require that you play 8th seed playoff basketball to do it. You can lose a ton and give these guys a ton of minutes to develop. But these three guys are already known-quantities as high level prospects. You can't be sure a third overall pick or a fifth overall pick or even a first overall pick will be as good as a Markkanen or LaVine, so these three assets are really more important than your own first. You could probably argue Dunn, and to a lesser extent LaVine, but Markkanen is definitely more important than your 2018 first round pick.

**2) Get as high a draft pick (and as many draft picks) as possible while accomplishing Objective #1.** You can' t sabotage the developments of the three aforementioned pieces just to get the #1 overall pick. LaVine has to come back and play. Markkanen and Dunn have to develop chemistry. Etc. However, certain players are expendable and not important to developing Dunn/Markkanen/LaVine.


**3) Clear as much cap space as possible to enable you to sign as many impact free agents as possible before Dunn/Markannen/LaVine need big contract extensions.** Self-explanatory. I'm not having any delusions of Lebron coming here, but DeMarcus Cousins is a free agent, isn't he? So is Chicago native and 20 ppg scorer Jabari Parker.

**4) Develop and keep as many future supporting pieces as possible to supplement your core (#1), while not harming objectives #2 or #3 too much.** This means, for example, that Bobby Portis is a really nice backup center that you'd love to have on a contending playoff team, for when you get there. Try to keep him, but if he's hurting the tank, he's expendable. Same can be said of Niko.... but it doesn't mean he automatically needs to be traded, because again, he's a young, valuable supporting piece.

............

My analysis of how to accomplish those four goals would be to go about it in this order:

1) The first piece that needs to go is Lopez. He's not a part of the future. He's expensive. And not having him leaves a gaping hole at center that will allow us to lose some games. Trading him clears out minutes for Markkanen (objective #1) but also helps us lose games (#2) and frees up space for the offseason FA period (#3). He might hurt #1 a little because he's not around to be a veteran presence for the young guys, but he's not the same style player as Markkanen, so I'm not sure how much he can tutor him anyway. Trade him.

2) Felicio is the next piece that should go. Portis is more valuable as the long term backup big man. Portis is better and, for now, cheaper. I don't even know why Felicio was re-signed to this deal. See if you can move him along with Lopez, maybe. I'd trade away a second round pick just to get rid of this contract, frankly, to accomplish objective #3. This will also help weaken front court depth so as to be an Achilles heel for the Bulls this season, resulting in losses.

3) See if you can find takers for Holiday, Payne, or Grant. I'll take seconds or expirings. Just want to clear off their cap hits for next year and weaken our depth this year, helping with Objective #2 and #3. 

4) The Mirotic and/or Portis decision. This is the tricky part. Firstly, you have the question as to whether these guys can co-exist long term. If no, one of them has to go, period. Mirotic seems like the better option to ship out, as he's more expensive (helps objective #3) and since he's so hot right now, he's hurting #2. He could also bring back a significant asset, perhaps, which I'll say adding draft picks goes towards helping Objective #2 also.

If they can co-exist, then you have to analyze them in context of #2 and #3. Frankly, I think, despite Mirotic's cap hit of $12.5m, the Bulls are in excellent position if they can move the other names I already discussed. They currently only have $46m committed next year. Subtracting Lopez (14.3), Felicio ($8.4), and even one of Grant/Holiday/Payne (I'll go with the mean... $3), gives the Bulls only $21m committed, plus cap holds. The cap is supposed to be nearly $100m, yes? The Bulls will be able to give out two max deals plus fill-in contracts if that is the case. There is no need to move out Mirotic to create cap space if Lopez/Felicio/others are moved. In fact, you probably do not find a more impactful use of Mirotic's $12.5 million other than on Mirotic himself.

So the question becomes, does Mirotic hurt the tank by keeping him around? Well..... yes and no. My hope is more no than yes. I would hope that by dealing Lopez, Felicio, and some depth, the Bulls hurt themselves enough that Mirotic can stay. Do they end up with the worst record in the league? No, they probably do not, if Mirotic is here. But do they fall outside the top 3-4 worst records? Maybe they don't. If they have the 3rd worst record instead of the worst record, is that really the end of the world? As pointed out earlier, the odds of getting the first overall pick are already only 25% if you have the worst record. If you have the third worst record, your odds are only slightly worse. I might rather have Mirotic and a 18% chance of the first overall pick rather than no Mirotic and a 25% chance at the first overall pick. Especially in a year where there is no Lebron or Durant at the top. Instead, we are in a year where Doncic at 3 might actually be better than Bagley at 1. 

The only other consideration is, what can you get for Mirotic? If some team was offering a top 8 pick for him, well, then that throws all the other analysis out the window.

Similar to what the Celtics did this year. If we could get 2 high first round picks for our first pick should we? I think our most depleted position is small forward and I was all in on taking MPJ until his injury. I’m not an expert and don’t know how he will recover but I can’t imagine taking him at #1 anymore. Ayton looks great and worthy of the #1 pick but I feel like the SF position is much harder to find talent at. I know when you have a top pick you draft on talent but I still love MPJ and want him on our team if he is able to recover. Considering he’ll drop to probably 4/5 do you think one of those teams would offer a future first and this years pick to get the first pick. ,"Let’s say Bulls get the #1 pick, should we trade down?

"The Finnish Broadcasting Company (YLE) did a cool piece about Lauri, so I went ahead and translated it. Definitely worth a read! Original article: https://yle.fi/urheilu/3-9969484

---

**INDIANAPOLIS.** A luxurious hotel lobby. Chandeliers are glimmering. Well dressed visitors are enjoying their neatly served coctails.

7-foot-1 Lauri Markkanen arrives rocking his Bulls sweatsuit, turning a lot of heads. He has a quick chat with the Bulls play-by-play voice Chuck Swirsky before sitting down for the interview. 

The first thing he asks is ""Is it cold outside?"" – because he has no clue, after spending the day in the hotel, mainly in his own room. After hearing the answer, he heads back to grab some warmer clothes. 

It has been a long day for the Bulls first round pick.

– I woke up in Chicago, hit the weight room, and had a one-hour practice with the team. After that, we caught the plane to Indianapolis. After the shuttle to the hotel, I've just been waiting for you guys to call me up for this interview. Haven't had much time for anything else, Markkanen says – flashing a wide grin.

**SUITCASE LIFESTYLE AND LEARNING EXPERIENCES**

The daily life of an NBA rookie is full of new experiences. Even though the Bulls have only played roughly 20 games and have 60 left, the season has already consisted of multiple road trips. Markkanen has high praises for his agency, which has prepared him well for the NBA lifestyle – there have been no surprises yet.

The everyday life in NBA is very different from college life. Only a year ago Lauri was spending his days in long video meetings and team dinners. However, in the big boys' league you have to take care of yourself. The Bulls organization does not provide meals for the players, with the exception of a sandwich before morning practices.

Unlike in the Wildcats or the Finnish national team, Lauri has his own hotel room with the Bulls. One could use a roommate:

– I gotta admit, it gets pretty lonely at times.

– In the end, NBA life is fairly boring. You are always preparing for the next game. Mainly just killing time in the hotel.

During the road trip, the team moves from one luxurious hotel to another every one or two days. The team travels with a private plane. The NBA regular season is roughly six months long, half of it is spent on the road. During this trip, the Bulls are flying from Chicago to Indianapolis and Charlotte.

The rook has already embraced the professional lifestyle. Thoughts are always locked in the next game.

– You learn something new every day. I have already gotten a hang of the routines: knowing what to pack, how things work at the hotels and so on.

During an NBA road trip, players bounce around hotels a lot, and the young Finn has had some little mishaps. However, he has developed a routine to never forget his room number again:

– You just save the room number to your phone every time you arrive to a new place. You will forget it if you don't.

– When you hit a new hotel in the middle of the night, you sometimes end up going completely in the wrong direction in the morning. Sometimes it's tough to even remember where you're at, and how you can get down from your room.

**""I rarely leave the hotel room""**

The evenings can get dull in your own hotel room. Markkanen packs a laptop with him to kill time with TV shows and movies. The Finnish giant also bought a portable gaming console before the season started, but he hasn't been using it after the first trips.

– I have gotten a sense how you have to spend your free time. The games wear you out, so every little break and downtime you get, you have to sleep and recover somehow. Therefore I decided to leave the console home.

During road trips an NBA player has tons of possible temptations and interesting activities: nightlife, five star restaurants and so on. NBA organizations don't monitor their players, so your options are almost unlimited. Markkanen, however, rarely leaves the hotel.

– If we arrive to the city on the game day, I'll just stay at the hotel.

– We have a bunch of Finns playing college ball here in the States, and I try to always see my buddies when I have time. But mostly I'm just chilling at the hotel.

**""To be honest, I have no clue how most of the other guys spend their free time""**

Markkanen doesn't know if he is an odd one in the bunch: he doesn't have much knowledge of how the other Bulls spend their time when the team is on the road.

The shooting star from Jyväskylä says that preparation and routines are different for each and every player.

– I believe everybody has their own thing that they like to do. To be honest, I have no clue how most of the other guys spend their free time. I'm just focused on my own game and the next opponent so I'm as ready as possible.

This week Markkanen will see four nights of action during a six day period. Two of the games are away games, and two of them are in homely United Center.

All of this was a dream for Lauri Markkanen ten years ago. Now he is living the dream.","""I gotta admit, it gets pretty lonely at times [during road trips]"" - Lauri Markkanen interview by the Finnish Broadcasting Company The Finnish Broadcasting Company (YLE) did a cool piece about Lauri, so I went ahead and translated it.

"Okay, I'm playing devil's advocate, but hear me out: 

If the Bulls still had a healthy D-Rose (and Jimmy presumably), they would still be a perennial #1-3 seed in the east, winning ~60 games a year and contending for a championship. 

When a team wins, fans are obviously happy and less critical of management, coaching, etc. So, in this awesome hypothetical situation, we as Bulls fans wouldn't be saying ""Fire GarPax!"" because we would be fucking excited with the success of our team due to management's drafting. We might even be okay with how they are managing the team right now.  

My point is, maybe we are being too critical of management when things could very well be great for this team right now. GarPax had some good drafts recently (Markkanen, Marquis Teague lol just a joke, D-Rose, Jimmy, Noah, Taj), so maybe they aren't as bad as we think.

I'd be happy with any of the four when we get to pick but I wish it didn't seem so close.  I have an unhealthy need to draft the best of the four and I really don't know who that will be.

Doncic still may not commit, I hear?  MPJ's back is a definite concern, especially given the history with our medical staff.

Ayton and Bagley are my favorites right now.  Bagley seems the most NBA ready and he's averaging the same number of boards as Ayton.  Their PERs are almost identical.  

Ayton and Lauri, both out of U of A, would be a front court narrative I would love.  Twin tower Wildcats.  The best front court in the NBA...I can see it now.  Would be dope.

However, I think Ayton, along with Lauri, is a second option at his ceiling.  On the other hand, Bagley could end up being a real build-around guy.  Lauri and Ayton makes less sense to me than Lauri and Bagley.

Ayton and Lauri, both out of U of A, would be a front court narrative I would love.  Twin tower Wildcats.  The best front court in the NBA...I can see it now.  Would be dope.

However, I think Ayton, along with Lauri, is a second option at his ceiling.  On the other hand, Bagley could end up being a real build-around guy.  Lauri and Ayton makes less sense to me than Lauri and Bagley.

"I personally (and probably most of us) trashed Fred a ton last season, especially in the playoffs. But I have to tip my hat to him because he seems to be doing a stellar job with this team despite its record. After last night I thought ""where the hell did this offensive game that Dunn suddenly has come from?"". Well at this point I think its safe to say Fred is a big reason for that. I felt we really lacked a 3pt presence last year but this year Zel and Lauri have been very good perimeter shooters and Dunn has been solid on both ends of the floor. Once Zach comes back I'm excited to see what this team can do with a leader. And based on how well I have seen development from our young players under Fred, I'd say I'm willing to give him a chance to go long term with this team and grow with them.

"#Denzel Valentine, Robin Lopez, Bobby Portis, & 2020 1st round pick (Lottery protected) for JR Smith, Tristan Thompson, & 2018 Brooklyn Nets 1st round pick

**Cleveland Cavaliers Recieve:**

#Denzel Valentine

Why the Cavs do it?

>You put Zel in a system where a player like LeBron tears apart the defense and you will have a great offensive piece who can be dangerous if you allow him to get in rhythm. This could be the key piece this team needs, not only now, but moving foward as well.

Why the Bulls do it?

> We're starting to see flashes of the player the Bulls drafted Valentine to be, so I could be wrong about parting ways with Valentine but I just don't see Valentine being better than Lavine nor do I see him being a quality starter at foward and being capable of defending elite players at the position. There just isn't a starting role for Valentine on this team. If the Bulls have an opportunity to get a top 5 pick in this year's draft at the price of packaging him and anyone not named Markkanen, Dunn or Lavine than they should pull the trigger.

#Bobby Portis

Why the Cavs do it?

> This conversation comes down to who would be the better role player coming off the bench and having the most potential to be apart of the team moving foward. Portis or Mirotic. The obvious answer here is Portis. Even though Mirotic provides more offensively, he's inconsistent while Portis can be just as consitent offensively (which isn't saying much) as Mirotic but can be more consistent on defense which has been a big weakness to the Cavs.

Why the Bulls do it?

> As a Bulls fan, I'd much rather see Mirotic go rather than Portis,  but its Cleveland who has the bargaining chip with the Nets pick. I don't see a future in the Bulls starting lineup for either one and would be ok with letting go of either player if it means a top 5 projected pick.

#Robin Lopez

Why the Cavs do it?

>Lopez provides the defense the Cavs lack to make this run. He would also be the teams best true center which allows other guys to play at their true position that made them who they are.

Why the Bulls do it?

> There's nothing wrong with Lopez. He's a quality starter on a solid contract. A top 5 projected pick is well worth the player.

#2020 1st round pick (Lottery protected)

Why the Cavs do it?

> Even though Valentine, Portis, & Lopez are a solid group of guys this is a top 5 projected pick in a great draft class we are talking about here. The Cavs are going to rightfully demand more than just an upgrade at Center and two young players who *might* have potential for shot at a young star in the upcoming draft. 

Why the Bulls do it?

> Because they will get a top 5 projected pick in this upcoming draft. If Bulls fans (which they exist on this sub) think that Valentine, Portis & Lopez is enough for a top 5 pick in the draft than they need to take off their homer goggles. The Cavs will laugh at this offer if there is no draft capital in it for them. They're going to want future assets for basketball after LeBron. 

>If this move didn't work the Bulls will still have their 2020 pick anyways and it gets pushed off the following year, if they lose the 2020 pick it's because the move worked and they're competing so whats the problem? Are we really going to draw the line and skip out on a shot at elite talent over a late first round pick years down the road?

**The Chicago Bulls Recieve:**

#Tristan Thompson

Why the Cavs do it?

>Thompson has been struggling and isn't playing up to par in contrast to what he's getting paid. Unloading his contract for a true center who is more talented and on a better contract is an all around upgrade. 

Why the Bulls do it?

>That top 5 projected pick.

#JR Smith

Why the Cavs do it?

>JR Smith is in a similar situation as Thompson. Struggling and not playing at the level he is getting paid. Cavs should be looking to unload his contract. Packaging him and his fellow struggling and expensive teammate for two young and cheaper talents who produce just as well and have more potential in terms of the of the future would be an upgrade any way you look at it, but the Bulls will need an upgrade in draft picks for this to be achieved. 

Why the Bulls do it?

>That top 5 projected pick tho!

#2018 Brooklyn Nets Pick (#5 Projected)

Why the Cavs do it?

>This might be Clevelands last chance at making a championship run before LeDeparture. JR Smith, Shumpert, & Thompson have all been struggling enough to warrant worries for the Cavaliers championship hopes. If there is any chance Cleveland wants to go out with a bang before years of mediocrity in a superteam league then they need to make a move to address their positions of weakness. If they make this move it might be exactly what this team needs to bring them back to finals this year and help them be a more young, cheaper, and well rounded team after the Lebron era in Cleveland. All the Cavs would need to do moving foward into 2018 and beyond is to either draft or sign a solid SF in the next year or two and the starting lineup of IT/Valentine/(Insert Rookie or FA SF)/KLove/Lopez could put this team back in the playoff picture a lot sooner than later. Who knows, what if this is the move that takes this team on the finals run that convinces LeBron to stay? After all, this trade frees up an extra $14M+ in capspace next year which can be used to draw in talent...

Why the Bulls do it?

>This is what the trades all about. With two top 5 picks in a very talented and top heavy draft, the Chicago Bulls could possibly be in position to bring this rebuild to an end a lot sooner than later. Just imagine.

*(STRAWMAN TRIGGER WARNING!: I'm not saying the Chicago Bulls will have these picks nor these players will in fact be available. I'm just throwing out some ideas to paint a picture of what could happen based of what I perceive from current records since I can't predict the future. You could use your own imagination of what picks we'll have and who we should draft if you want. This isnt me saying we have to draft these players. Just throwing out possibilities so you can jump to your own conclusions.)*

**Scenerio A**

IMO either one of these scenarios is a win/win for the Bulls. This move could potentially put an end to the rebuild. The personell is there. It just comes down to developing and building chemistry from here on out.","Trade Idea. #Denzel Valentine, Robin Lopez, Bobby Portis, & 2020 1st round pick (Lottery protected) for JR Smith, Tristan Thompson, & 2018 Brooklyn Nets 1st round pick

>This is what the trades all about. With two top 5 picks in a very talented and top heavy draft, the Chicago Bulls could possibly be in position to bring this rebuild to an end a lot sooner than later. Just imagine.

*(STRAWMAN TRIGGER WARNING!: I'm not saying the Chicago Bulls will have these picks nor these players will in fact be available. I'm just throwing out some ideas to paint a picture of what could happen based of what I perceive from current records since I can't predict the future. You could use your own imagination of what picks we'll have and who we should draft if you want. This isnt me saying we have to draft these players. Just throwing out possibilities so you can jump to your own conclusions.)*

**Scenerio A**

>1: [DeAndre Ayton](https://youtu.be/eMsrIImwCxk)

>5: [Michael Porter Jr](https://youtu.be/chYLDZ0jUic)

**Scenario B**

>1: [Luka Doncic](https://youtu.be/r78iQIg7QKQ)

>5:[Mohamed Bamba](https://youtu.be/ahMJemil-lQ)


**Scenario A**

>PG: **Dunn**

>SG: **Lavine**

>SF: **Porter Jr**

>PF: **Markkanen**

>C: **Ayton**

**Scenario B**

>PG: **Dunn**

>SG: **Lavine**

>SF: **Doncic**

>PF: **Markkanen**

>C:**Bamba**

IMO either one of these scenarios is a win/win for the Bulls. This move could potentially put an end to the rebuild. The personell is there. It just comes down to developing and building chemistry from here on out.",24,1,Trade Idea.,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/7f8lfn/trade_idea/

"I have to admit that I wasn’t keen on trading Butler because of what he meant to the team and what he represented for the Bulls, but in hindsight it was absolutely the right move. Jimmy’s last pre-FA years would have been wasted on this middle-of-the-road team; the best we could have gotten if we kept him is likely a 7th or 8th seed and another first round exit. Instead, we got immediate valuable assets (two young players plus a draft pick) as well as opening the window to tank for a potential generational talent in this upcoming draft instead of being stuck in mediocrity. Let’s look at the pieces one by one:

Zach Lavine - It’s hard to make any definite conclusions since he still hasn’t come back from injury yet, but he definitely has talent, work ethic, and explosive gameplay. I look forward to seeing him on the court in red.

Kris Dunn - Yes, he was a bust last year. But he wasn’t a top lottery pick for nothing, and he’s already showing massive signs of improvement under Hoiberg. If he keeps this up, he can become a valuable player for years to come.

Lauri Markkanen - What can I say? Steal of the draft. Trading up from 16th to 7th to pick him looks like a great move in retrospect; if that’s what it took to convince the Twolves, we had to do it. There were people saying at the time that we should have picked Monk, but that discussion is now long over. Lauri is my new dad, even though he’s younger than me and has a girly name.

Pundits and fans across the board gave us a failing grade on the trade when it happened. Hard to see that happening if they were asked to re-evaluate it now. GarPax made the right move even though it was an unpopular one. So for this time, props to them. Hope to see more good decisions moving forward.","Credit where credit is due - the Butler trade is setting us on the right direction I have to admit that I wasn’t keen on trading Butler because of what he meant to the team and what he represented for the Bulls, but in hindsight it was absolutely the right move.

"Zach Kram posted an interesting article today on TheRinger.com about what even a small sample size can tell us about a rookie's potential for stardom.  [LINK HERE](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/11/15/16654232/how-to-identify-an-nba-draft-bust-markelle-fultz).  The basic gist of his article is that players who end up having very productive NBA players show it in the first 10 games of their careers, and conversely, busts show their bustdom in their first 10 games.  The two metrics Kram uses to support this premise are Win Shares and Game Scores. 

Using these metrics, Kram writes that Sixers fans should be worried about Fultz but heartened about Simmons.  Kram notes ""Simmons has the ninth-best first-10 [Game Score] of any rookie since 1983–84"" at 16.5  According to BasketballReference, the 2017 rookie with the second-best first-10 Game Score?

I'll post the relevant questions but the whole interview is interesting. 

**Q: So I enjoyed your ESPN segment, but wanted to follow up with a question. When you said the Bulls took the “Fred Hoiberg route,” what does that mean?**

A: “That means like everybody knows me and Fred had some riff-raff. We didn’t agree on many things. And I think eventually, everybody was like, ‘Yo, they’re either going to build the team around Jimmy, or they’re going to go the route with Fred, the up-and-down, shoot a lot of threes or, you know…

“Look, I iso-ed a little bit (smiles). Yeah, I iso a little bit. And that’s not the way that Fred plays the game. And that’s what I was saying, that it was either, ‘We’re going to build the team around me for a little bit and allow me to distribute the basketball, iso in pick and roll. Or you go with Fred – go up and down, shoot a lot of threes, that type of stuff. That spread type – kind of Golden State-esque, you know what I mean? They went that route, and that’s all I’m saying, and that’s fine. That’s what I was saying. Nothing’s wrong with that.”

**Q: Is it safe to assume, though, that you wish they never fired Thibs?**


A: “I mean look, it ain’t my job to say who I want the coach to be. My job is to go out there and play. I mean I guess you could guess who I would rather play for. We’re not going to sit here and say that that’s a huge secret. I mean whoever they decided to bring in, my job was to help them win to the best of my ability. And I felt like I did that in Chicago. I feel like I’m doing that here. I feel like I would do it in any organization that I would be in.

“So with that being said man, I just want to hoop. I just want to ball. I just want a chance to win a championship. I just want to win. I wake up every day smiling. Why? Because I’ve got my people around me. I really don’t give a damn what anybody thinks about me or what I say or what I do. I get to hoop, I’m happy, and I’ve got my football with me.""","Jimbo follows up on his ""Fred Hoiberg route"" comments Anyone else read this yet?

"I just thought I'd send some good vibes your way.  With all these terrible trades, I wanted to give you my $0.02 on ours a couple months later.  IMHO you did better than you think. 

LaVine is legit.  As our #3 scoring option he put up 18.9 points on .387 3pt%/.576 TS% and obviously won the slam dunk contest with his amazing athleticism.  Not only that, he was our closer.  Clock running down, you didn't want Wiggins or Towns you wanted Zach.  He's got *it*, cold blooded and no fear.

He's also improved leaps and bounds offensively every year.  So while he was one of the ~~worse~~ worst defenders in the NBA at age 21, he's certainly shown a work ethic to improve.  Zach will probably never be a great defender, but most players improve their D significantly from 21 to 25.  He's 22 now ofc, but hasn't played since 21.  

LaVine's also been a very good teammate that everyone on the team spoke well of (and still does).  Zero character issues.

Obviously the injury is a worry and his defense needs an awful lot of work.  But you're gonna love him once he gets rolling.

"Hey guys,

It's been a while since we last posted, but thought today was a good day to break that streak! We're launching a new game today inside the official Bulls app where fans can answer a series of questions as the game happens. The questions include trivia, predictions, etc. and fans will have a chance to win a million dollars if they get all of the questions right. Knowing that’s going to be super hard, there are smaller prizes fans can win each game as well as some slightly bigger season long prizes which you are entered to win each time you play. 

Anyway, we're 'soft-launching' it tonight, mostly for testing purposes, and wanted to see if any of you would be willing to play along and give us some feedback on what you think of it? Our thoughts are that the Reddit community probably represents a pretty tech-savvy portion of our fanbase and so would be a good group to get feedback from! 

If you're up for it, the game is open now & the first 3 questions are up. You'll need the Bulls app, navigate your way to the 'Featured' section and then scroll down to 'Extras' where you'll see the '$1m Fanbeat Challenge' logo. 

Shout with any questions. We'll keep an eye on this post for any feedback. And a friendly reminder that the Bulls digital team does not have any control over roster decisions so we’re not the best folks to send trade suggestions to ;)

Go Bulls!

Dan & Luka (two of the guys who gave the admins the tour around the UC last season) ","Launching a Second Screen game in our Mobile App tonight! Hey guys,

It's been a while since we last posted, but thought today was a good day to break that streak! We're launching a new game today inside the official Bulls app where fans can answer a series of questions as the game happens. The questions include trivia, predictions, etc. and fans will have a chance to win a million dollars if they get all of the questions right. Knowing that’s going to be super hard, there are smaller prizes fans can win each game as well as some slightly bigger season long prizes which you are entered to win each time you play.

"In my opinion, if we want this rebuild to come together a lot quicker than first expected then we have to have a top 5 (preferably top 3) pick in this draft. The guys at the top of the draft have insane talent and could be franchise changing. Pair one of them with Lavine and Markkanen and that’s a fantastic core of young players that could get real good real quickly. 

My worry is that, outside of OKC, this team has already proven to be pretty competitive and has been in every game. I’m a bit worried that Lavine coming back may actually push us outside the 5 worst teams. Looking at the Mavs, Kings, Hawks, Nets, and Suns so far this season leads me to believe that they’ll also be terrible for most of the year. This team was supposed to be a shoe-in for a top 3 pick and now I’m not so sure.

Obviously I’m more than happy seeing Markkanen play at a much higher level than initially expected and seeing our team develop as a whole, but we can’t afford to miss out on one of the top 3-5 guys in this draft. This is the draft that can push us out of a long and painful rebuild much quicker. Thoughts? I love Lopez but he likely needs to be traded at the deadline and we may need tank commander Cam Payne to play big minutes down the stretch.

"I was curious to why Niko has a trade clause in his contract, and why he can be traded only after January 15th, 2018.  The simple answer is because the CBA protects his Bird rights.

Bird rights are important for players as it allows their former team, or the team they are traded to, to resign them up to their max salary if that team is over the salary cap. [criteria](http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q25) [importance](https://www.google.com/amp/s/deadspin.com/nikola-mirotic-no-longer-wants-to-play-with-the-guy-who-1819937896/amp)

There are certain situations where the league protects players to maintain their Bird rights, and Niko’s contract is one of those situations.  Niko met the criteria for the Bird Exception from playing with the Bulls for three seasons, but his new contract is only a one-year deal (the league excludes his second year team option).   Any player with Bird rights (or a “Qualifying Veteran Free Agent” as described in the pictures below) who signs a one-year deal with his former team gets an implicit trade clause in his contract.  This is because they lose their Bird rights if they are traded, and I confirmed this with Cap guru, Eric Pincus.  The January 15th deadline is also mandated by the CBA (I attached pictures of the clauses in the CBA).

In the end, Bird rights may not matter as much as because it looks like Niko wants out due to this whole fight ordeal.  I guess we’ll just have to wait until after January 15th to find out.

"Let's start this with one thing; If Chicago kept Jimmy Butler, they would've been a perennial 7-10 seed in the East. Being the 7-10 seed in the weak east is arguably the worst position in the NBA. A mid level pick, no playoff success, and no true direction. On top of that, with the contracts they had, it would've been difficult for the Bulls to build a team that could've competed with the Warriors or Cavs. The Butler trade may have pulled on my heart strings, but it was the right thing to do. The trade gave the Bulls a direction that they haven't quite had for a couple of years. Trading Butler for 3 solid, young players may turn out well, as these 3 players seem to fit into the system that Coach Hoiberg wants to run. On top of that, 2-3 years of struggling could turn in to 2-3 top picks, therefore resulting in a solid young core to build around for the future. 

At the end of the day, we all want to see good basketball from the Bulls. I think this trade has pointed Chicago in the right direction, and hopefully bring them back into title contention.

First opinion piece, hope you all enjoy it.

CHI includes a 2018 second round pick.

Pretty self explanatory, Bulls get a younger and commit to the tank. Dario is a huge asset that could be paired nicely with Lauri and whomever CHI drafts this year. Okafor is an add in, I've always wanted to see him play for his home team....and honestly, what do the Bulls have to lose?

PHI gets a solid back up center for Embiid and clears some of the front court logjam by moving Saric. Everyone in Philly loves ""The Homie,"" but when push comes to shove and it's time to sign extensions, Saric is most likely the odd man out.

Saric is too good to be the back-up behind Ben Simmons and Covington, Philly needs to set him free! Valentine is a nice prospect for PHI, not quite as good as Saric but the insurance for Embiid is needed if the Sixers are thinking playoffs.

What are your thoughts /r/Chicagobulls ?","Trade Idea? RoLo for Saric http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=yd2dto3j

Would Markkanen have to take the backseat and ride the bench and hinder his progression for the sake of chemistry or will he start?

"Now hear me out, We don't really have to stress cause we're not looking to make the playoffs. **Lauri Markannen** has looked very good so far, I didn't think much of him when we drafted him but he's totally proving me wrong. 

So far I'm impressed with **Justin Holiday**, **David Nwaba** & **Robin Lopez**. These guys might be all over 25 but they're still giving us something to watch.

Looking forward to seeing **Kris Dunn** step up when given the minutes. As well as **Zach Lavine** when healthy. Lord knows when Lavine gets back it'll be dunk city. We're finally heading in *a direction*

Possibly pick up a decent FA like **Jabari Parker** (RFA) or **Nerlens Noel** (UFA) in Free Agency.

With all the Niko and Portis stuff going down and one of them probably moving, things are lining up for it to happen


So right now im having lunch downtown and i get a notification that Philly is still looking to trade Okafor but has no one interested. This is going to happen imo

Thoughts? Whos for it, whos against it? I know he hasnt had the brightest start of his career, but he is from Chicago and im loyal so id support him either way. Maybe he could even change his career around with a scenary change, we all know he didnt want to be in Philly from the night he was drafted there. 

If it came down to it, would you rather have us move Portis or Mirotic since its one or the other

"**David Nwaba**, the 24 year old SG has arrived. At the very least on to the horizon of Bulls fans after his stellar 15 points, 11 rebounds performance in the 91-86 win against the Atlanta Hawks. The athletic 6 ft 4 sophomore was picked up in free agency on a 1 year contract by the Bulls after impressing in limited games with the Lakers.

Nwaba is an explosive guard who can outrebound his size and will hustle on defense. He is a complimentary player next to the slew of 3 point shooters that the Bulls have this year, and is showing early on that his one of the few Bulls that can drive and slash to the basket.

**Positives**

* Athletic

* Rebounds well for size

* Safe handles, nothing too flashy

* Attacks the rim well, both on/off ball

* Hustles on D

**Negatives**

* Needs work on his jump shot, mechanics look fine but hesitant to shoot outside of the paint.

* Small for a SG, may struggle against the bigger and stronger SGs in the league where his athleticism isn't enough to make up the difference

* Nickname is Mr. Dunk (according to [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/n/nwabada01.html)) - Stacey will have to soon rectify that

"With so much cap and roster flexibility comes many opportunities to fantasize. The '14 draft class that didn't get extensions earlier this month will be available in restricted free agency this off season. That would mean the '15 draft will be looking for deals the next summer. Who are some young guys you're hoping come to Chicago?

For me it's:

Kelly Oubre- He's got a really nice all around game that would compliment Zach well. He plays good active defense and has a developing offensive game. With Washington on the hook with Wall, Beal and Porter for big I think Kelly could be picked off. 

Glenn Robinson III- Another player that I think compliments Zach well on the wing. Not to mention they spent time together in Minny their rookie season. He's a good athletic, defensive player that has shown flashes. 

Jordan Clarkson- The opinions on him are mixed but I think he can be had for cheap considering LA is going to have to cut salary heading into the upcoming off season. He's a playmaking combo guard I think is capable of starting at PG. 

Dante Exum- Dante is kind of in the mold of the rest of the PGs the team has tried post-Rose. He was a lottery pick that hasn't really put much together but has enough potential through youth and talent to consider giving him a shot. The hope would be that he can develop a shot to pair with his athleticism and defense to become the starter he was hoped to be.

Tyus Jones- Ive always loved Tyus. What he lacks in size and athleticsm he makes up with composure to execute in all situations. He's called Tyus ""Stones"" for a reason. Not to mention his knockdown shot. It makes me wonder what could he do with a bit more opportunity.

Someone's center: Lauri should be allowed to stay a 4. He's rebounding a bit better than I expected but I still don't think you want him as your 5 trying to get boards and protect the rim. So who's that leave as targets after RoLo is inevitably traded? Whiteside? Nurkic? Biyombo? Capela? Or do you go Ayton or Bamba in the draft? I lean towards the latter.

"Obviously they play different positions, but hear me out. Markkanen has the same quick release, beautiful stroke, consistency, and confidence with his shot. Additionally, I think their shot mechanics are very similar (quick, high, silky smooth release). He'll never be the perimeter defender that Thompson is, but I think Markkanen could become every bit as good as a scorer. I love this kid.","Lauri Markkanen reminds me of a 7 foot Klay Thompson Obviously they play different positions, but hear me out.

"Can't help but be happy that Gar have the bahls to move on from the former Bulls.


After watching  Minnny Timberbulls vs Spurs, I see the same individual plays Thibs run on D.Rose, Jimmy and Pau, being run on Teague, Jimmy and Towns. Taj is taj and he is being used the same. Wiggins is playing off the ball because he basically can't have the ball in his hands.


Minny's offense is so dry and has no ball movement.


With the talent they have, they should be averaging over 100 pts per game. But they failed to hit that last night.


Yes yes, it's one game. But their offense lacks creative plays. It's centered on 1 vs 1. They can afford to score on 1-vs-1 with the talent they have. But it's still a talent being used inefficiently.


On defense, Thibs still use that guard the paint and repel incoming attacks principle.


While in fact, Spurs attack are coming from the outside. Either by shooters being freed by screens, or cutters getting lose on pin downs.


Most offense now starts by spacing the floor. It gives breathing room inside the paint for a pass and easy points. And it's driven by ball movement.


I didn't see that with the Timberbulls. They play like the Thibobulls that I know. 


It's just a contrast I see from watching talented guys playing one vs one, against what I have saw in this Bulls roster running some plays and moving the ball.


#I am really glad we pushed the reset button and move on.


**We will suck but it would be entertaining**


And even though I haven't seen LaVine played as a Bull. I am already assured Gar made the right decision trading Jimmy to the Wolves.

I think this will be the last time I will post for the Timberbulls.


PS: Right now I'm following D.Rose. I am more excited in him than the rest of the Timberbulls.","Moving on from the Timberbulls Can't help but be happy that Gar have the bahls to move on from the former Bulls.

"Tanking creates a toxic environment.  We haven't even started the first season of tanking and already we have a fight that leaves one player injured, another in danger of being cut, and certain to be suspended.  

The silver lining is that rookie Lauri Markkanen may get more minutes as a result.  The bad news is that this type of atmosphere and example could adversely affect Markkanen's development as a player.  Players don't respect each other, they don't respect the coaches, they don't respect the front office.  And this is just the beginning!

I went through tanking before in the early 2000s and it was awful.   When the Bulls did draft good players -- Elton Brand, Ron Artest, Jamal Crawford -- they couldn't do anything with them and eventually traded them in an attempt to start over again and again.

For the Bulls the playoff drought lasted 6 years.  But that's about average.  The Timberwolves have a current playoff drought that has lasted 13 years.  The Kings have a current playoff drought that has lasted 11 years and they are still tanking.  Even the big market Lakers, in a city attractive to NBA players, have a current playoff drought that has lasted 4 years, and no one expects it to end this year -- or any time soon if they can't lure free agents next summer.

Tanking is absolutely a last resort.  GMs know it, too, because they tend to lose their jobs after a few years of tanking.  But it is a way of extending a GM's tenure for a few years.  It's just really awful for the players, especially, because they know everyone expects them to fail, and even wants them to fail.

And it's awful for the fans.  I've never understood fans who are proud of sticking with their team and watching every game during a tank that lasts for years.  Good for you, but really?  That's something to be proud of?

There is a different kind of tanking that works, but it's rare.  The Celtics traded their best players when people still thought they were good and got a lot for them.  The Spurs tanked with David Robinson on the bench and drafted Tim Duncan.  I'm not saying tanking never works.  But it often fails, particularly because the front offices that resort to tanking often created the problem in the first place.","People wondered why I opposed tanking, but the fight between Mirotic and Portis is just the beginning.

"Considering both jabari and lavine are about to become RFAs the next summer, i was thinking that obviously the bucks are not ready to pay big jabari and the bulls are not ready to pay big lavine. 

I read about chicago's potential interest in jabari, so i was wondering what would your thoughts be on a february trade proposal like: 

jabari+henson for lavine+lopez?

You guys get a potential star to build around, plus great guy and from Chicago. lose lavine but not really because i'm not sure if you would be ready to invest in him (maybe you are, i don't know).

We offload the henson contract (we will have to pay brogdon and middleton before it expires) and get lavine for 3 months to see how he clicks with the rest of team before we decide what to do with him. we lose jabari but also not really because i don't think we would match a max offer, if it was offered to him.

"When I write CBA posts I have three goals: to tell stories through numbers, to simplify complex concepts, and to get people to stop using [Trade Machine](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine); because understanding the details of how trades work is *super interesting.*

Recently, I posted about how non-simultaneous trades work reference to Cleveland's [Richard Jefferson trade](http://www.spotrac.com/nba/transactions/cleveland-cavaliers/). It's not well understood and I wanted to write another post about non-simultaneous trades: the Jimmy Butler trade. **If you're interested in details of the financials, this post is for you.** If you enjoy, check out our new dedicated [CBA subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_CBA_QandA) and subscribe. Feel free to correct any mistakes.

**Background**

On [June 22nd](http://www.spotrac.com/nba/transactions/chicago-bulls/trade/) the Bulls traded Jimmy Butler and their number sixteen draft pick for Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn, and the number seven pick. Those draft picks ultimately became Justin Patton (16) and Laui Markkanen (7). On the face of it, the reasoning is pretty simple: Chicago is ready to start over, meanwhile Minnesota is looking to win now. But we're not here to talk about that. How does that trade actually work on paper, and why is structured the way it is?

**Some background on trade rules and salary cap**

If a team is under the salary cap (currently $99m, previously $94m), then trade is the wild west: basically no rules, *as long as you are below the cap after the trade.* A quick word: most teams are over the cap even if their total salary isn't. This is because there are other things [added on](http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q13). We'll circle back to that later and why it applies to Chicago.

If a team finishes above the cap once the trade is completed, then they go from the wide open west to the cloistered hallways of an IRS office: there are a lot of rules, and they vary based on whether a) the team is a taxpayer, b) the way the trade is structured. At no point is CHI a taxpaying team, so we'll disregard that; however the structure of the trade is important because is seldom used.  

There are basically two main rules of trade: how the salaries have to match and how much time you have to complete the trade. This is a foreign concept to most people. Most people assume that a team agrees to a trade, the league approves it, and it's done. Discount all the time spent haggling back and forth, and the whole thing takes a few hours. **This is not true.**

There are two types of trades: simultaneous and non-simultaneous. A simultaneous is what I just described: win bam boom, sign the papers and it's done. There are rules about salary matching that you can read about [here](http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q86) in detail, but for all intents and purposes, it's pretty simple. **The Butler trade is a non-simultaneous trade.** 

Imagine a team wants to make a trade, but they can't get the salaries to match. The league says, 'hmm, let me help you with that.' It writes a rule that says you can make a trade even if the salaries don't match (see above link), but there's a catch. The league won't just let you dump a bunch of salary for peanuts: instead, *whichever team receives the lesser amount of salary* has the difference added on to their salary cap, and the trade is not completed until this difference is zeroed out and the amount is removed from the books. This amount is just a paper number that isn't being paid *but it matters for accounting purposes when determining if a team is tax payer, or if they are over or under the cap,* and it is called a **trade exception.** (Exceptions are called 'exceptions' because they allow teams to make signings/trades when they are above the $99m cap. A team with no exceptions basically cannot sign anyone.) Essentially, a non simultaneous trade **isn't completed until the TE is used in a second trade.** We'll come back to that, but first let's illustrate.

**The actual trade numbers**

Chicago sends out $17,552,209 (Butler) in salary. Minnesota sends out $3,872,520 (Dunn) and $2,240,880 (Lavine) for a total of $6,113,400. (Reminder: all of these numbers come from *2016-17 season*. The NBA calendar starts on July 1st; this trade took place a few days prior.) The difference between the amounts is $11,438,809: nowhere near matching, with CHI sending out *waay* more than it receives. Because of the mismatch, CHI makes the trade non-simultaneous. This means that CHI receives a trade exception (an amount on paper only) worth the difference, or the $11.4m. This number sits on their books, affecting their tax and cap status, but it is not paid to anyone. As I mentioned above, exceptions are the mechanisms which allow a team to make signings/trades when they are above the cap. That means that CHI can now use said exception to trade a player for any amount up to the exception plus $100,000, with the only caveat being that it expires in one year.

So say CHI likes player X who is paid $10m and they want to trade. Bam, CHI can trade for him and doesn't have to send out any matching salary. Obviously the other team will want something, but it could be something as minimal as a second round draft pick.

**I'm sorry, but it's even more complicated than that.**

Now that you have the basics, I can get to why this is truly a super complex trade. Remember when I said that a NS trade is not really complete *until another trade happens to use the exception?* Well this is the case here. For CHI this trade functions as both *the completion of a previous NS trade*, and also *the first transaction in a second NS trade to be completed at a later date*. Here's the numbers again with this wrinkle added in:

CHI signs Dunn using a previous trade exception. This completes a previous NS trade. Then, CHI trades Butler for Lavine. The difference in the two salaries is $15,311,329. This is CHI's new trade exception. It is a paper number paid to no one yet it counts against their cap, putting them over the salary cap in fact. It is valid for one year and allows them to sign any player for a first year salary of $15,411,329. (They get $100k in leeway.)

**I could go on** but that is the basics.

"I'm god damn excited to watch the bulls play this season. I've been holding off on saying anything because everyone has been so negative these past couple of weeks but I don't care anymore.

We have deadeye shooters in Valentine, Mirotic, and Grant,

We have a promising young rookie who is considered the best 3 point shooter in this draft and is also the Future Dirk in Markkanen,

We have our new father in Justin Holiday,

And finally come All-Star break, we'll have high flyin', free throw line jumpin', fearless shootin', son of a gun Zach LaVine lead our team.. And we also get back Cameron Payne.

This will be a long season, we will have our ups and downs and definitely even more downs but all we can do is stay positive, enjoy watching our young guys play their hearts out every game and by the end of the season, we will have drafted MPJ or Bagley.

###Synergy Offense

**PPP** stands for Points Per Play. I did not record the number of possessions, but rather the number of offensive plays that Jordan was involved in, meaning he either attempted a FG and/or FT, or turned the ball over (on drives to the hoop). I did not record any FTA he had as a result of intentional fouls or penalty fouls where he was not aggressively attacking or attempting to make an offensive play. No technical FT's are on the chart either. Every play category aside from **Transition** is in a half court set, and transition also includes jump shots, though this was very rare. The **Other** category primarily consists of desperate attempts to beat the clock, including the full court buzzer beaters.

There are several sub-categories out of **Isolation**. Jordan tended to be quick and decisive, very seldom holding onto the ball longer than 3-4 seconds like the wing players do in this era. Another category is **Drive To Basket**, which measures his effectiveness driving to the hoop strictly in the half court. Every other category is basically a jumper, though if there is a pick in the two man game that enables him to get an advantage over the defense, then it is recorded as under the **P&R Ball Handler** category. This includes jump shots as well as drives to the hoop.

**Sports Illustrated - May 21, 1990**

 > It wasn't so much that Hawkins scored only two points in the final 12 minutes, it was more that Jordan wouldn't even let him touch the ball. The least recognized part of Jordan's game is his ability to slip picks and suddenly pop up in the passing lane, like a kid who finds a shortcut to the candy store. ""Nobody has ever been better at the end of a game than Michael,"" said Bulls coach Phil Jackson afterward. "" Oscar Robertson was great, but this guy is a closer at both ends.""

**Sports Illustrated - June 28, 1993**

 > There would seem to be four players with whom realistically to compare Jordan: Magic and Bird, both of whom were three-time regular-season MVPs; Bill Russell, the ultimate winner, who led the Celtics to 11 championships in 13 seasons; and Oscar Robertson, whose versatility, leadership and coldhearted competitiveness during 13 seasons make him closest to Jordan in playing style.

 > ""Oscar was great defensively when he wanted to be,"" says 68-year-old Bull assistant Johnny Bach. ""But Michael is the Tasmanian devil.""

**Sports Illustrated - May 21, 1990**

 > It wasn't so much that Hawkins scored only two points in the final 12 minutes, it was more that Jordan wouldn't even let him touch the ball. The least recognized part of Jordan's game is his ability to slip picks and suddenly pop up in the passing lane, like a kid who finds a shortcut to the candy store. ""Nobody has ever been better at the end of a game than Michael,"" said Bulls coach Phil Jackson afterward. "" Oscar Robertson was great, but this guy is a closer at both ends.""

**Sports Illustrated - June 28, 1993**

 > There would seem to be four players with whom realistically to compare Jordan: Magic and Bird, both of whom were three-time regular-season MVPs; Bill Russell, the ultimate winner, who led the Celtics to 11 championships in 13 seasons; and Oscar Robertson, whose versatility, leadership and coldhearted competitiveness during 13 seasons make him closest to Jordan in playing style.

 > ""Oscar was great defensively when he wanted to be,"" says 68-year-old Bull assistant Johnny Bach. ""But Michael is the Tasmanian devil.""

"Hey guys,

First off: sorry, this is kind of a shit post. Hopefully we can get some good discussion about the team out of it.

I'm a guy from the UK who grew up in the 90s really liking the Bulls, but I haven't ever really watched Basketball consistently and haven't followed the NBA outside of the 2k games for years.

I'm  starting to get back into it, but I have no idea who anyone on the Bulls current squad is. So I was wondering: who do you guys rate as 'our' (still feel like a fraud saying that!) best players at the moment? Do we have any stand-outs? ESPN seem to think we're shit. I watched the Pelican game highlights yesterday and thought Lopez and Grant looked pretty good, though highlights can be deceiving.

I'd massively appreciate any advice people can give me for getting back into the team.","New (sort of) Bulls fan; who should I be looking out for? Hey guys,

"GarPax used to be pretty good at drafting players, although they sucked at trading and free agency.  But for whatever reason (some people trace it to the departure of [their Director of College Scouting](https://www.blogabull.com/2015/5/18/8610703/why-the-bulls-no-longer-draft-successfully-the-loss-of-matt-lloyd-and)) they lost the one knack they had and failed to build a team around Jimmy Butler between 2011 and 2017.  And they continued to suck at trading and free agency.

Some argue that they were forced to trade Butler and tank, but they were the ones who painted themselves into that corner by failing to draft and develop talent around him (or trade or recruit talent, but no one really expected that).  And if they were going to tank, they really should have done it in 2016 rather than bringing in Rondo and Wade.  

Yes, I'll admit they would have been roundly criticized for doing so, and would have deserved criticism because, once again, they failed to build around Butler.  But at least they would have traded Butler while the price was higher, and would not have wasted a year on Rondo and Wade, which pretty much everyone knew was a desperate move.

They also fired a respected coach in favor of a coach with no NBA experience and keep claiming that was an improvement.  They act as if they know what they are doing but since 2011 there's no evidence that they do.

Finally, some of the disgust with GarPax is misdirected disgust with ownership.  The problem is that Jerry Reinsdorf is mostly invisible these days, having moved to Arizona more or less permanently and leaving the responsibility of running the team to his son, Michael.  And Michael rarely appears before cameras.  So the hate gets directed at GarPax until, every once in a while, people realize ownership created this situation and shows no signs of changing it.","Someone asked me why Bulls fans want GarPax fired, and I gave it a shot.

"I've been pondering this question a little bit, and I think the Bulls have more of a blank canvas than most teams projected to have a shot at the #1 pick. I think the consensus choice league wide would have been Bagley before Eurobasket, but Doncic blew that open with his performance. 

If Markanen is as good as he looked, you could pair him with anyone projected to go top 5 I would think - MPJ or Ayton would also fit fine, add in a healthy LaVine and sign a point guard and you've got a pretty strong nucleus. 

For my pick, I'm going Doncic. I don't think any of the other top prospects would have been able to perform the way he did on that sort of stage.

"This is copied/pasted from the original web page, so please forgive the formatting and lack of visual flair. It's also long. I ranted for a fair bit. Anyway, I'd love your feedback on this if you make it all the way through! 

I struggled for a while with a way to open this article that didn’t involve a curse-laced tirade towards the two men perhaps most responsible for my pain and suffering over the past five-ish years. Finally, I decided on a fun fact: the longest-tenured Chicago Bull is three-year forward and current free agent Nikola Mirotic. Mirotic has seen postseason action, he’s seen DNP-CDs, and like every other player on this roster, his future is in flux as the Bulls enter their second full rebuild since the Jordan era.

This time, however, it feels different. The draft-day trade that sent All-Star swingman Jimmy Butler to Minnesota and former mentor Tom Thibodeau gave Chicago fans no illusions about the next few years. They will be full of draft picks and low win totals, as the team tries to find their home run player. However, the haul itself was lacking, and it highlights the longstanding inability of Bulls management to properly conduct a rebuild.

Lauri Markkanen, Kris Dunn, and Zach LaVine pose after meeting with Chicago media. These three pieces of the Jimmy Butler trade hope to spearhead a new Bulls era.

**Evaluating the Return for Butler:**

*Zach Lavine*

Headlining the trade was two-time Dunk Contest Champion and one-time ACL-tearing guy Zach LaVine. The high flying 2-guard scored admirably in Minnesota, but did little else — 3 assists to 1.8 turnovers, less than a steal a game, 3.4 rebounds — worth noting. While even a healthy LaVine is a questionable lead piece in a Butler trade, the fact that the explosive guard is coming off an ACL tear injects increased uncertainty into his future. Chicago fans are perhaps warier than most about knee injuries in young, explosive guards. Every tumble or awkward landing LaVine suffers will be accompanied by the gasps and bated breath of Bulls fans.

Even worse than this is that LaVine’s time in Chicago may be short-lived. The front office is notoriously cheap, and with his restricted free agency looming on the horizon, there’ll be a hefty sum of money thrown at a guy who’s played one season in a Bulls jersey. LaVine is a terrifically gifted scorer from nearly every part of the floor, and being the primary option on a zero-star team will give him the opportunity to stamp some impressively inflated stats onto his résumé. Given the FO’s track record of going to lengths to avoid paying free agents large sums — trading Rose and Gibson, allowing Rondo to walk, forcing Butler to accept a below-market deal after a stellar 2014-15 — it seems unlikely they bring back LaVine on a healthy deal.

I expect one of two things. Either another team ponies up for the UCLA product after he plays terrific basketball in the United Center, or he doesn’t play very well and Bulls management locks him up for 5/95. While it may seem a pessimistic outlook, the track record of management has been anything but confidence-inspiring.

*Kris Dunn*

Of course, Chicago didn’t just receive LaVine. In addition, they got Kris Dunn, who the team nearly traded up for in last year’s draft. Dunn had an extremely disappointing rookie season and was then still acquired by the Bulls. He was supposed to be one of the most NBA-ready prospects in the 2016 draft: a defensive point guard with excellent athletic potential that led a middling Providence team to the NCAA tournament. Instead, he was a mess, demonstrating a remarkable lack of feel for anything offense-inclined. He couldn’t pass, shoot, or participate without tripping over his own two feet, leading to an abysmal –1.2 Offensive Win Shares. It was visually better on defense, and Dunn’s defensive skill (1.3 Defensive Win Shares) was just barely enough to raise his Win Shares to a positive number (0.1).

The offense is still more worrisome than the defense is reassuring, though. Dunn posted nauseatingly-low efficiency numbers during his rookie season, with regular splits of 37.7 FG%, 28.8 3P%, and 61.0 FT%. Those numbers boil down to (wow, I actually gulped after reading this) an Effective FG% of 41.1% — that is not a typo folks. I understand that not everyone is stats-inclined, so putting that number in context, Dunn is shooting about 10% lower than what you could consider “acceptable” eFG% numbers.

He stinks. My blood pressure is skyrocketing just thinking about it. There was hope that Dunn could turn it around, but Summer League reports aren’t promising; Dunn was worse than miserable in his sole Vegas (11 points on 25% shooting, three assists) appearance. As with any rookie, there’s the hope of marked improvement in following years, but Dunn is no spring chicken. He’s 23 already, making him older than Giannis Antetokounmpo and only two days younger than Joel Embiid. Especially compared to those two, Dunn is nowhere near as NBA-ready. Any improvements need to happen quickly; Dunn has about five-to-seven years before the athleticism that he leans on so heavily starts to leave him.

*Lauri Markkanen*

I’d be remiss to run through this trade without talking about the 7th pick of the 2017 NBA Draft, Lauri Markkanen, who the Bulls selected when they swapped (because of course, they couldn’t keep their own pick) picks with the Wolves. Markkanen was an exceptional shooter in college, and while that’s certainly a valuable skill in a 7-footer, he lacks any real star potential. He’s not physically gifted, nor does he excel at creating for himself off the dribble. Instead, Markkanen relies on someone else (Kobi Simmons or Allonzo Trier in college) to draw the play for him.

The Finn did some things right in Summer League  — namely shooting and rebounding — but his wild inconsistency hurt the team on more than one occasion. Going 0–10 from three-point range in one game is never a great sign for a player whose main talent is supposedly long-range shooting. Of course, there is some optimism for Lauri’s future, which stems primarily from his play with Finland’s national team. Markkanen has been far and away the team’s top scoring option, which is, at the very least, encouraging for his offense against grown men. Still, Markkanen struggled somewhat in Eurocup play prior to the return of Finland’s Petteri Koponen, who set up Markkanen for a lot of his success in later matches. It’s hard to say if Dunn or Jerian Grant will have the necessary chops to generate the same open looks.

Markkanen certainly has time to develop, but early showings have not been exactly jaw-dropping. This was the Bulls’ first chance to pursue a franchise player during this rebuild (I need to forget that Dennis Smith was still available), and the selection of a one-dimensional player like Markkanen with such glaring weaknesses does not bode well for the future.

**Chicago’s Track Record in the Draft**

Of course, if the Bulls are rebuilding, they’ll need to start nailing the draft, which is typically the only real way for a team to regain its status as a contender. While it’s tempting to label the Bulls front office as a solid drafting group, a closer look reveals that’s hardly the case. We can go on all day about how the team of the early 2010s was almost entirely homegrown, but how much of that can really be accredited to Chicago’s scouts? Rose, the MVP and driving force behind Chicago’s explosive success, fell into the Bulls’ laps in 2008, and he was almost guaranteed to go first no matter who held the pick. They couldn’t miss on that.

Thanks to the New York Knicks giving away their 1st round picks for Eddy Curry, the Bulls were in a position to also acquire Joakim Noah in 2007. The key players for the 2-time NCAA Champion Florida Gators all declared for the draft that year, and both Al Horford and Corey Brewer were selected ahead of Noah. While the concerns about Noah’s limited offensive game were — and continue to be — valid, his vaunted defense at Florida translated well to the NBA. Picking 9th in so shallow a draft, it again would be hard to miss on Noah, whose name was plastered across ESPN and the like from collegiate success.

The two best picks that can really be attributed to Bulls management are those of Jimmy Butler and Taj Gibson, both of which were late-round picks whose success is nearly entirely a product of world-class work ethic and blue-collar grit. Who did the Bulls miss on, then? Let’s look at all those first-round picks the organization struck out on:

* 2009: James Johnson — This is almost more Thibs’ fault than GarPax. Johnson has proven himself to be a wonderful player when used properly, and he hadn’t been until Miami. Taken before Gibson in the same draft, Johnson failed to reach Gibson’s contribution level for half a decade.

* 2012: Marquis Teague — Boy oh boy, did they ever miss on this one. Teague is still a running joke among Chicago fans, who blame GarPax for ignoring Thibs’ pleas to draft Draymond Green.

* 2013: Tony Snell — Hoiberg gave Snell so many chances to be great and he waited until being traded to step up. Disappointing. Bucks Snell is very valuable, but don’t be confused; he was horrid in Chicago.

* 2014: Doug McDermott — Doug himself wasn’t a disappointing pick, but the price Chicago paid (16th and 19th picks of the 2014 draft, 2015 2nd rounder) was too high, especially considering what the Nuggets acquired (Jusuf Nurkic, Gary Harris, and Sir’Dominic Pointer, respectively) with those picks.

* 2015: Bobby Portis — It’s possibly too soon to give up on Portis, who played some of his best basketball against the Boston Celtics in the 2017 playoffs. However, he lacks any real defensive ability, and his inconsistent offense is not covered by his motor.

* 2016: Denzel Valentine — Deemed a day-one NBA-ready player by scouts, Valentine had an abysmal rookie season and didn’t show much improvement in this year’s Summer League. While concerns about Valentine as a defender were apparent from the outset, his shooting and passing inefficiencies were debilitating.

I’ll give credit where credit is due; the Bulls have drafted above average in the second round, which is confusing to me, but not quite upsetting. Omer Asik, Paul Zipser, Chris Duhon, and Aaron Gray are/were all contributors at some point. While it’s encouraging to see a team excel at finding cheap gems, it also compounds the frustration from the Bulls selling this year’s 2nd-rounder to Golden State for a $3.5 million consolation, which likely goes to cover the salary of some White Sox rookie. It hurts more because they acquired Jordan Bell with that pick, who nearly dropped a 5×5 in Summer League and looks to be as skilled as — and potentially more useful than — the aforementioned Markkanen.

**Operating in Free Agency**

The Bulls’ moves in free agency have steadily worsened in recent years too. While Chicago has generally been a homegrown team, free agency is a necessary part of retaining or obtaining relevancy. With that in mind, the biggest names to sign with Chicago have been Carlos “AND-1!” Boozer, an ancient Pau Gasol, and the equally ancient Indiana-Jones-and-the-Waders-of-the-Lost-Ark-edition Dwyane Wade.

Each player commanded a huge chunk of salary at the cost of roster flexibility, and each had a questionable fit with the team dynamic. Boozer and Gasol struggled to a very noticeable degree at defense, and while Noah was spry enough to somewhat cover for Boozer, he lacked the mobility to help Pau on every single botched pick-and-roll. Wade, meanwhile, has been soaking up the sun while rumors fly that the young players on the team dislike him. If a future Hall of Famer isn’t having a positive veteran influence on a developing team, then what’s the point?

This raises more interesting points. Forman and Paxson don’t really seem to care about surrounding the team with positive veterans, so long as the veterans they keep have an impressive résumé. While Wade was kept around, Rondo was dumped following a season where he was frequently commended for his work with the rookies. Sure, Rondo had his fair share of chemistry issues, but it was with other veterans (like Mr. Wade) rather than with the future of the franchise.

Who else has the franchise shed with a good reputation? Taj Gibson (worked out and helped with the development of Bobby Portis and Cris Felicio) comes to mind, as does Luol Deng (instrumental to the rise of Jimmy Butler), who the Bulls strung through a botched surgery and then traded for a bag of Lima beans. If the Bulls plan to find themselves in the upper echelon of the lottery, then having players to coach their young stars through the NBA adjustment is hugely important.

**Silver Linings**

There are some things that Chicago has done well. The addition of a G-League team has been hugely helpful, and, along with the Summer League, has been a source of undiscovered talent like Cristiano Felicio and new two-way signee Antonio Blakeney. The summer’s resigning of Felicio also reflects a positive move; while many NBA fans may stagger at the $32 million that the Bulls have committed to a backup center, Felicio’s tremendous growth over two years in limited minutes is the kind of potential that a rebuilding team can afford to invest in. Letting Michael Carter-Williams and Isaiah Canaan walk in free agency was also necessary if Chicago wants to give young guards like Dunn and Grant (and yes, Cameron Payne) adequate chances to run the offense — not to mention that both of the former guards were unpromising garbage during most of their Bulls tenure.

For the most part, it does seem like the young players are jumping at the bit to fill the veterans’ void. Jerian Grant posted on Instagram that he’s hoping to make a run at the Most Improved Player award this year, and with no clear leader at point guard, his road there is wide open. Bobby Portis has been active on Snapchat, posting near-daily workout videos where he seems to be working on ball handling, a huge weakness for the Arkansas power forward. Payne has said he’s putting on weight, though strength is hardly his biggest weakness, while Felicio has continued to add to his skillset, and potentially could have a working three-point shot by the regular season.


While the players will do their best to win games, the onus falls squarely on the shoulders of two men for whom red and black is confined to ledgers instead of uniforms. It’s true that Chicago’s management has never actually been put in a position to fully rebuild, and that they could, in fact, pull off a series of dynasty-building moves that restore the Bulls to their 90s glory. Unfortunately, nothing they’ve done in the past suggests that will be the case.

Gar Forman and John Paxson have absorbed the concentrated ire of Finals-hungry Bulls fans for almost half a decade; now is their chance to affirm or refute the justification of that anger.","I wrote something about GarPax being unable to rebuild, thought the sub might enjoy it! This is copied/pasted from the original web page, so please forgive the formatting and lack of visual flair. It's also long. I ranted for a fair bit. Anyway, I'd love your feedback on this if you make it all the way through! 

I struggled for a while with a way to open this article that didn’t involve a curse-laced tirade towards the two men perhaps most responsible for my pain and suffering over the past five-ish years. Finally, I decided on a fun fact: the longest-tenured Chicago Bull is three-year forward and current free agent Nikola Mirotic. Mirotic has seen postseason action, he’s seen DNP-CDs, and like every other player on this roster, his future is in flux as the Bulls enter their second full rebuild since the Jordan era.

This time, however, it feels different. The draft-day trade that sent All-Star swingman Jimmy Butler to Minnesota and former mentor Tom Thibodeau gave Chicago fans no illusions about the next few years. They will be full of draft picks and low win totals, as the team tries to find their home run player. However, the haul itself was lacking, and it highlights the longstanding inability of Bulls management to properly conduct a rebuild.

Lauri Markkanen, Kris Dunn, and Zach LaVine pose after meeting with Chicago media. These three pieces of the Jimmy Butler trade hope to spearhead a new Bulls era.

**Evaluating the Return for Butler:**

*Zach Lavine*

Headlining the trade was two-time Dunk Contest Champion and one-time ACL-tearing guy Zach LaVine. The high flying 2-guard scored admirably in Minnesota, but did little else — 3 assists to 1.8 turnovers, less than a steal a game, 3.4 rebounds — worth noting. While even a healthy LaVine is a questionable lead piece in a Butler trade, the fact that the explosive guard is coming off an ACL tear injects increased uncertainty into his future. Chicago fans are perhaps warier than most about knee injuries in young, explosive guards. Every tumble or awkward landing LaVine suffers will be accompanied by the gasps and bated breath of Bulls fans.

Even worse than this is that LaVine’s time in Chicago may be short-lived. The front office is notoriously cheap, and with his restricted free agency looming on the horizon, there’ll be a hefty sum of money thrown at a guy who’s played one season in a Bulls jersey. LaVine is a terrifically gifted scorer from nearly every part of the floor, and being the primary option on a zero-star team will give him the opportunity to stamp some impressively inflated stats onto his résumé. Given the FO’s track record of going to lengths to avoid paying free agents large sums — trading Rose and Gibson, allowing Rondo to walk, forcing Butler to accept a below-market deal after a stellar 2014-15 — it seems unlikely they bring back LaVine on a healthy deal.

I expect one of two things. Either another team ponies up for the UCLA product after he plays terrific basketball in the United Center, or he doesn’t play very well and Bulls management locks him up for 5/95. While it may seem a pessimistic outlook, the track record of management has been anything but confidence-inspiring.

*Kris Dunn*

Of course, Chicago didn’t just receive LaVine. In addition, they got Kris Dunn, who the team nearly traded up for in last year’s draft. Dunn had an extremely disappointing rookie season and was then still acquired by the Bulls. He was supposed to be one of the most NBA-ready prospects in the 2016 draft: a defensive point guard with excellent athletic potential that led a middling Providence team to the NCAA tournament. Instead, he was a mess, demonstrating a remarkable lack of feel for anything offense-inclined. He couldn’t pass, shoot, or participate without tripping over his own two feet, leading to an abysmal –1.2 Offensive Win Shares. It was visually better on defense, and Dunn’s defensive skill (1.3 Defensive Win Shares) was just barely enough to raise his Win Shares to a positive number (0.1).

The offense is still more worrisome than the defense is reassuring, though. Dunn posted nauseatingly-low efficiency numbers during his rookie season, with regular splits of 37.7 FG%, 28.8 3P%, and 61.0 FT%. Those numbers boil down to (wow, I actually gulped after reading this) an Effective FG% of 41.1% — that is not a typo folks. I understand that not everyone is stats-inclined, so putting that number in context, Dunn is shooting about 10% lower than what you could consider “acceptable” eFG% numbers.

He stinks. My blood pressure is skyrocketing just thinking about it. There was hope that Dunn could turn it around, but Summer League reports aren’t promising; Dunn was worse than miserable in his sole Vegas (11 points on 25% shooting, three assists) appearance. As with any rookie, there’s the hope of marked improvement in following years, but Dunn is no spring chicken. He’s 23 already, making him older than Giannis Antetokounmpo and only two days younger than Joel Embiid. Especially compared to those two, Dunn is nowhere near as NBA-ready. Any improvements need to happen quickly; Dunn has about five-to-seven years before the athleticism that he leans on so heavily starts to leave him.

*Lauri Markkanen*

I’d be remiss to run through this trade without talking about the 7th pick of the 2017 NBA Draft, Lauri Markkanen, who the Bulls selected when they swapped (because of course, they couldn’t keep their own pick) picks with the Wolves. Markkanen was an exceptional shooter in college, and while that’s certainly a valuable skill in a 7-footer, he lacks any real star potential. He’s not physically gifted, nor does he excel at creating for himself off the dribble. Instead, Markkanen relies on someone else (Kobi Simmons or Allonzo Trier in college) to draw the play for him.

The Finn did some things right in Summer League  — namely shooting and rebounding — but his wild inconsistency hurt the team on more than one occasion. Going 0–10 from three-point range in one game is never a great sign for a player whose main talent is supposedly long-range shooting. Of course, there is some optimism for Lauri’s future, which stems primarily from his play with Finland’s national team. Markkanen has been far and away the team’s top scoring option, which is, at the very least, encouraging for his offense against grown men. Still, Markkanen struggled somewhat in Eurocup play prior to the return of Finland’s Petteri Koponen, who set up Markkanen for a lot of his success in later matches. It’s hard to say if Dunn or Jerian Grant will have the necessary chops to generate the same open looks.

Markkanen certainly has time to develop, but early showings have not been exactly jaw-dropping. This was the Bulls’ first chance to pursue a franchise player during this rebuild (I need to forget that Dennis Smith was still available), and the selection of a one-dimensional player like Markkanen with such glaring weaknesses does not bode well for the future.

**Chicago’s Track Record in the Draft**

Of course, if the Bulls are rebuilding, they’ll need to start nailing the draft, which is typically the only real way for a team to regain its status as a contender. While it’s tempting to label the Bulls front office as a solid drafting group, a closer look reveals that’s hardly the case.

"Hope Chicago Bulls Fans are ready for the tanking 17-18 season to begin and I also looking forward to Chicago Basketball this fall. I was originally holding on posting this on the Bulls Sub, so I hope you guys don't mind about it too. There is a familiar situation with both the *Bulls* and the *Sky* I've noticed. I'm not sure if you guys noticed it too?

Chicago Bulls are in rebuilding mode with Lauri Markkanen (The Finnisher / my nickname for him is Markky) along with trade additions of Dunn and LaVine. But it's not the only team tanking and rebuild in Chicago basketball for the 2017-2018 season. 

The lesser known WNBA team **Chicago Sky** also partially tanked this season. The Sky for the first time the 2017 Sky missed the playoffs this season since 2012 finishing 9th (out of reach). Sky only entered the WNBA finals once but barely got blown out by the Mercury in the series championship. 

Sky Head Coach (Pokey Chatman) was replaced after the 2016 season but the biggest move of all: Delle-Donne (franchise player) was traded to the Mystics just like Butler (face of the Bulls) was traded to the T-Wolves. The Sky was well compensated by the Mystics by sending Stefanie Dolson and Copper along with the 2nd overall pick, this pick landed the top defensive Center Alaina Coates to the team (injured ankle this year, will debut in 2018). 

The 2017 Chicago Sky's new General Manager and Head Coach Amber Stocks then made this other move: They traded their long time player SF Tamara Young and young center Imani Boyette to Atlanta at the end of the trade deadline (July 30th). (Stocks is formerly the assistant head coach of the defending WNBA champs Los Angeles Sparks)

(Unlike the Jimmy Butler trade which people called this move 'Bulls got Fleeced'. Atlanta Dream ultimately 'got fleeced' with their top draft pick as veteran Tamera Young is in Free-Agency and Boyette is just 2 seasons in.) 

Guess what the Sky received from Atlanta: an extra top four Draft Pick from Atlanta to complement Chicago's top 4 draft pick. They'll have *two* top draft picks and a top second round pick. Not only just those two picks alone, the 2018 WNBA Draft will be very deep with talent than this years draft. Chicago Sky could be in a position to strengthen their front court and augment the bench personnel. The WNBA Draft Lottery is this Thursday (Sept. 14 during the Mystics vs Lynx game I think) so pray for the lottery gods Chicago lands the number #1 overall pick with two picks (if they can land around #2 or #3 with the other). 

[Review and the Sky's Future](http://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/even-after-missing-playoffs-sky-have-reasons-for-optimism/)

I hope Bulls have better luck if they're going to land or obtain the number one overall pick in the NBA next season. 

I noticed something is missing in the flair of this sub but I won't ask. There's no 'Sky' flair.

That is all Chicago basketball fans.

Sky Head Coach (Pokey Chatman) was replaced after the 2016 season but the biggest move of all: Delle-Donne (franchise player) was traded to the Mystics just like Butler (face of the Bulls) was traded to the T-Wolves. The Sky was well compensated by the Mystics by sending Stefanie Dolson and Copper along with the 2nd overall pick, this pick landed the top defensive Center Alaina Coates to the team (injured ankle this year, will debut in 2018). 

The 2017 Chicago Sky's new General Manager and Head Coach Amber Stocks then made this other move: They traded their long time player SF Tamara Young and young center Imani Boyette to Atlanta at the end of the trade deadline (July 30th). (Stocks is formerly the assistant head coach of the defending WNBA champs Los Angeles Sparks)

(Unlike the Jimmy Butler trade which people called this move 'Bulls got Fleeced'. Atlanta Dream ultimately 'got fleeced' with their top draft pick as veteran Tamera Young is in Free-Agency and Boyette is just 2 seasons in.) 

Guess what the Sky received from Atlanta: an extra top four Draft Pick from Atlanta to complement Chicago's top 4 draft pick. They'll have *two* top draft picks and a top second round pick. Not only just those two picks alone, the 2018 WNBA Draft will be very deep with talent than this years draft. Chicago Sky could be in a position to strengthen their front court and augment the bench personnel. The WNBA Draft Lottery is this Thursday (Sept. 14 during the Mystics vs Lynx game I think) so pray for the lottery gods Chicago lands the number #1 overall pick with two picks (if they can land around #2 or #3 with the other). 

[Review and the Sky's Future](http://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/even-after-missing-playoffs-sky-have-reasons-for-optimism/)

I hope Bulls have better luck if they're going to land or obtain the number one overall pick in the NBA next season. 

I noticed something is missing in the flair of this sub but I won't ask. There's no 'Sky' flair.

That is all Chicago basketball fans. 

Load up the Tank! Let's Go Bulls!

*edit: sorry newpua_bie for getting Lauri's surname spelling wrong. ",12,49,2017 is a good time to tank for Chicago Basketball. And it's not just the Bulls. The Sky also slowly tanked too.,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/6zg8lc/2017_is_a_good_time_to_tank_for_chicago/

"Jimmy Butler was the last remnant of the old Chicago Bulls core.

&nbsp;

After that trade, Bulls has cleansed the team of the old era.


Bobby Portis is the only player in the current roster that is acquired in 2015. The rest was acquired starting last season.  He is also the only one left to play for former coach Tom Thibodeau.

&nbsp;

Everyone loves the old core. They have a good run and gave us a lot of hope for a finals appearance. But as players gain mileage, they're bodies broke down. And with the experience they gain, their price becomes higher.


&nbsp;

It's about time to let them go.

&nbsp;

None of us wants to tank. But we aren't tanking this season just to get the #1 pick. Nobody is assured of that. The front office timed it to rebuild this season because of three things.


1) The amount of talent in this draft.


2) The amount of talent in next season free agency(and less teams has the cap space for all of them).


3) To give Hoiberg and the young players to start a new era(D.Wade needs to go).

&nbsp;

This is going to be a one year stop gap, rather than a full rebuild. This franchise won't suffer five years, like Philly did.

&nbsp;


Bulls can clear $70M worth of cap space after trading Robin Lopez.


What will we do with it?

&nbsp;

**Best case scenario are the banana boat team.**


Any in the east who has Lebron are easily favorites in going to the finals. The reason this is a possibility is because, CP3, Melo and Bron are still chasing rings. They will have a hard time doing it in the West. And only the Bulls(since Philly need to extend Embiid and his cap hold is really high) has cap space to absorb them.

&nbsp;

**Less likely but still available, DeMarcus Cousins and Paul George.**


Russell WestBrook is likely going to LAL, so not all of them can fit in LA.


&nbsp;

**The real Bulls free agency would come from the non-maximum players.**


This is the primary reason why I see this as a one year stop gap.


Number 1 on my list would be **Nerlens Noel**


Great lob target for Hoiberg. Can defend the post and protect the rim. Noel for $20-25M per year for 3-4 years contract.


Then add Danny Green for vet presence. I'll over pay him $50M three years for his experience.


Then Bulls still have around $30M after this. They might choose to use this to absorb more contracts and Cash incentives, than acquire more players.


&nbsp;


This starting five plus a good bench could bring us back into the playoffs in a weak east.


**Dunn, LaVine, Green, Bagley, Noel**


or


**Dunn, LaVine, Porter, Markkanen and Noel**


No matter what happens, I think this is a better scenario compared to having Jimmy making $200M in his next five seasons.


&nbsp;




Then on 2021, we will be targeting **Anthony Davis**. Around this time, GSW would have won more championship and is likely isn't that dominating. The same goes to Lebron teams. This the a legit window for us to start dreaming at winning championships again.","Dawn of a new era Jimmy Butler was the last remnant of the old Chicago Bulls core.

"I actually can't remember a free agent, who actually played in games, having less leverage than Niko currently does entering a free agency period.  You'd think, as bad and inconsistent as Niko has been, given how valuable stretch 4s are becoming, that someone would have taken a flier on him, especially since he's an RFA, but there has not been a peep from any team or Mirotic's camp about offers, and there's a reason for that.  It's actually almost laughable how dire Niko's situation seems to be shaping up, and he's only got a month left to make something happen.

There are currently only 6 teams total who have the capacity to sign Mirotic, either because they are capped out (21 teams) or because they cannot exceed even the Bulls' qualifying offer (3 teams).

Of those remaining 6 teams, we have:

Denver Nuggets, who currently have 5 power forwards on their roster and are looking to offload one, Faried, as it is.

Philadelphia 76ers, who similarly have 4 power forwards on their roster and have been looking to offload one, Okafor, for a while.

Dallas Mavericks, who have Dirk/Noel/McRoberts standing in the way, and Barnes who flexes there for small ball lineups.

Indiana Pacers, who just drafted a 20 year old power forward, Leaf, and just traded for a 21 year old stretch 4, Sabonis, on top of already having Thad Young.

That leaves two teams who realistically *might* be interested in Mirotic, discounting those teams who cannot because they are over the cap (21), cannot beat out QO (3), or have so many PFs already on the roster that they would have no reason to (4).

Phoenix Suns, who while they don't have as many PFs as the other teams mentioned above, nevertheless have two very young ones who they appear very high on developing, Chriss and Bender.

Chicago Bulls, who we all know the situation of, and where he is an RFA so any offer can be matched.

Now, here's where things get interesting.  The Phoenix and Chicago are the only teams currently below the salary floor, Phoenix by ~$4 million, and Chicago by ~$14 million, however, neither team seems particularly eager to climb to it.  Phoenix and Chicago are both tanking, and both have expressed a great desire to maintain cap flexibility, though for slightly different reasons.  And, given that the only penalty for not hitting the floor is to have to pay the difference, a non-penalty in reality, neither team would have much urgency, Phoenix especially, since they know that offering a contract to Niko runs the risk of the Bulls *not* matching and being stuck with a piece they, being honest, probably aren't too high on.

As the rosters get formed more and more, Niko gets squeezed more and more.  It's unlikely the Bulls offer him a contract outright, given his performance for us over the past three seasons, but also because they are well aware of how sour the market is for him.  They can afford to wait, and they only have a month left to do so, and the longer that goes, the more team friendly any contract that Niko signs will become.

By October 1st, if he has not signed, Niko will either have to accept a qualifying offer at around 1/$4, or defer it, in which case the Bulls maintain his rights but he cannot play at all, for any team, for the next year until he becomes a UFA, as Montiejunas did a few seasons ago.

Either way, things look grim for Mirotic.","The precarious situation of Nikola Mirotic I actually can't remember a free agent, who actually played in games, having less leverage than Niko currently does entering a free agency period.

"This time I was at the arena, so I don't have to write this based on a postage-stamp-sized stream or just a box score... ;)

Lauri Markkanen was the man of the match in Finland's final preparation before the EuroBasket tournament. Finland continued its woeful ways by losing 91-100 but there were two definite positives. Markkanen, the future star, scored 26 points, his national team record, and PG Petteri Koponen, the incumbent star, made his summer debut after an injury. 

Finland has kept opponents of equal quality from scoring more than 70-something points this summer, but this time Russia was lethal, especially under the basket.

Markkanen shot 5/9 (55%) from two, 3/7 (42%) from three and was 100% (7/7) from the free throw line. He fouled out with 18 seconds left in the game. The international games are played with 10 minute quarters so five fouls are enough to get an early shower.

For the most of the first half, Markkanen and Koponen, who I mentioned earlier, did not play at the same time but in the latter half they got a lot of minutes together. Koponen, who Finland fans have eagerly been waiting, gave eight assists and had a promising game despite shooting 1/7 from the field.

Markkanen fared surprisingly well with Russia's big uglies, Timofey Mozgov (7'1"") of the Brooklyn Nets and the two time Euroleague champion Andrey Vorontsevich (6'9""), especially on the offensive end.

Finland starts the EuroBasket tournament next Thursday against France, the 3rd place team from 2015.

Most teams who started rebuilding have only just started to get better. Sixers seem to be ready to compete after 5-6 years. Wolves finally seem ready after KG left back in 06. Jimmy, Towns, Wiggins are solid. 

They're just two examples of a rebuild. Then you have guys like the Suns & Magic who have upside but fail to realise their potential. Also the Lakers look decent but won't be making any noise in the stacked West.

So anyway back on topic. Where do you see us 5 years from now? Still in basketball hell? A playoff team?

"I've seen a lot of negativity around the acquisition of Kris Dunn, which is understandable given his ineptitude on the offensive end last year. But I also see people regularly discuss Marcus Smart as a viable NBA player, potential starter and even a decent target for teams as a trade piece. So... I was curious to see how the two players stack up against each other as they have always seemed very similar to me, and as a fan who values defense, it seemed odd to me that one would be treated as a rugged role player, and the other as a pariah who doesn't have much of a future because he can't shoot.

I know the sample sizes are small, and I'm not a master of advanced stats, so I'm sure people will accuse me of cherry picking, but just know that this is a largely off the cuff comparison that I'm doing out of my own curiosity to see if what I see from watching games stacks up by the numbers. That is, that Smart and Dunn are pretty similar, and that Dunn might have some use to the Bulls after all.

**Measurables:**

Smart: Age 23, 6'4, 220. Wingspan 6'9"", Vertical: 36""

Dunn: Age 23, 6'4, 205. Wingspan 6'9 1/2"", Vertical: (unknown) pretty damn good.

On-court, per 36 numbers (career);

**PPG:**

Smart - 11.7.
Dunn - 7.9

**3P%:**

Smart - .291
Dunn - .288

**Total Rebounds:**

Smart - 4.8
Dunn - 4.5

**Assists:**

Smart - 4.6
Dunn - 5.1

**Effective FG%:**

Smart - 42.8
Dunn - 41.1

**FT%:**

Smart - .76
Dunn - .61

**Steals:**

Smart - 1.9
Dunn - 2.1

**Blocks:**

Smart - 0.4
Dunn - 1.0

**Turnovers:**

Smart - 2.0
Dunn - 2.4

So at a glance, they're pretty close. Especially since Smart has had 3 years of development at the NBA level. Smart is the better scorer and free throw shooter, while the 2 are almost identical in terms of 3P%, rebounding, assists, eFG%, turnovers and steals. Dunn has a marked advantage in terms of blocks, and shades a couple of other categories.

Tl;dr - Dunn and Smart are very similar players, in terms of measurables and on court performance. Yet one is a pretty highly regarded young prospect,while the other is a punchline to a joke that feels somewhat unfair.

Agree? Disagree? Please, tell me why I'm wrong below. I enjoy a spirited debate, and I am in the minority of people who seem to be happy that the Bulls acquired Kris Dunn.

"Now, this is gonna be a long one, and cover a lot of points, so I'll try to be as succinct with them as I can.  However, before I begin, I would like to preface this by saying that no, **this is not a defense of GarPax**, and no, **I do not trust them to make the most of this situation**.  And finally, **this is not an argument on whether or not we should have continued to build around Butler**:  it is merely a look at our current situation.  That being said, if unintentionally, it would appear that GarPax have been dealt a pair of pocket aces, and I do think it would be hard to screw this up.  We have an astonishing amount of flexibility heading forward, and here's why:

First, let us look at the upcoming season.

I don't think anyone would argue with the assertion that we will be bad, and there is certainly no chance that we will be contenders.  Given that, it would appear that we have 3 possibilities in terms of where we finish this season.

Option 1:  Top 5 pick.

Now this one is obvious, we are incredibly bad and land a really good pick (ideally top 3).  While this last draft was thought to be incredibly deep, the 2018 draft is projected to be incredibly top-heavy but very shallow.  After the top 5 trio of Bagley-Porter-Donic-Ayton-Bomba (and perhaps Bridges), it would appear, at least early on, that talent drops off precipitously.  But up to that point, the draft looks primed to have several options for a generational talent.  In other words, if there were any year to bottom out, especially given how dominant the Warriors appear to be, it's this year.  This would be ideal.

Option 2:  7/8 seed

This is essentially the ""we wildly overachieve"" option.  Somehow, we are much better than predicted, and combined with other teams being worse than advertised and a combination of 5 to 6 other teams trying to tank vault us into a playoff spot in the incredibly weak east.  Now, while you might say that we would be no better off than we were last season, fringe basketball hell, I don't quite think that would be the case.  I think it's common knowledge that Butler, and Rondo to some extent, basically dragged us kicking and screaming into the playoffs.  They're both gone.  538 has us projected as a 21 win team.  The east is bad, but that's still a ""one of the 3 worst teams in the league"" projection.  The only way we jump into the playoffs is if *everyone* surprises us.  It doesn't happen if just one of the following happens, all would have to to maintain the success needed:  Lavine launches himself firmly into all-star status; Markkaken pushes himself into RotY conversation; Dunn improves and proves he can capably run an NBA offense; role-play guys like Portis/Zel/Zip all make big strides; Hoiberg vastly improves (because a young team like this won't be nearly consistent enough unless he improves amazingly).  However, if that does happen, then we head into 2018/19 not in a bad spot either.  We'd have a core of Lavine/Dunn/Markkaken/whoever:  an athletic playmaking wing who can shoot, a defensive hawk, and an athletic big who can shoot 3s.  If one of them isn't good, well then we get a top pick to add another piece.  If they all are, well now you have the beginnings of a core that contains almost everything you need to succeed in the modern NBA.  More on this one later.

Option 3:  Not good enough for playoffs, not bad enough for a good pick

This would probably be the worst outcome heading into the following season, however it seems the least likely and is also the most easily remedied.  There are only 4 possible teams that I believe could truly be worse than us when push comes to shove:  Phoenix, Brooklyn, Orlando, and New York.  There are simply too many teams this season trying to be competitive, either to change their fortunes or to help develop a young core, for us to leave this group except with great effort.  There is simply too much talent, and we have too little of it, unless a shock ala option 2 occurs.  However, lets suppose that we are slightly better than this group as the season reaches its halfway point, but not good enough that we appear on a playoff track.  It would be easy to fall back into this group.  Rolo is an easily tradable contract that could net us perhaps a very late first; Wade will certainly need more ""rest""; etc.  While the worst possible option, I also think this option is simultaneously the most difficult to achieve and could only happen through sheer incompetence and willful ignorance (which given our FO is a possibility, but again ignoring that aspect this shouldn't happen).

Now, let us look forward to what follows the upcoming season, the 2018 FA period.  Now this is where things get interesting.  [There are a frankly astonishing number of young and talented free agents who will be coming into the market](http://www.spotrac.com/nba/free-agents/2018/), and the trend that started this year is only going to get worse next year.  Decent young guys, KCP, Reddick, Noel, Rose, Gay, Evans, Niko, and many more, have all been forced to take 1 year deals, or are looking at the prospect of being underpaid, because there is simply no market this year.  Teams exuberant spending the last 2 seasons in anticipation of a high cap have left them hamstrung, and with owners facing the prospects of massive luxury tax hits and not wanting to increase those any further.  2018 is going to get worse.

As it currently stands, assuming that **every single cap hold** is renounced, in 2018, there will only be 12 teams with more than 10 million dollars in cap space.  If this is done, there will be even more players flooding the market.  If those cap holds are not renounced, then there will only be 3 teams, **total**, who will have positive cap space, i.e. cap space above $0.  The Bulls are a member of both categories, and in the former, are one of only 5 teams that will be able to offer a max contract--we are set to have around 55 million dollars in cap space.  Even if Lavine recovers completely and earn a max, that'll still give us 30+ million to play with, still more than 26 other teams.  And that's the worst case scenario, if teams release every cap hold, which seems absurdly unlikely.  Even if many of those A-listers resign with there teams, those teams will then have very little cap space to play with, meaning the time would be prime to nab some good, young players on very team friendly contracts.  And if someone like Boogie/IT/Bradley, or an RTA like Jokic/Parker/Embiid, somehow fall into our laps, even better.

Either we maintain cap room past this period and continue to suck for at least another year (and another top 5 pick), or we spend some of it and this rebuild turns around faster than it perhaps otherwise would.  Especially for option 2, if we did somehow make the playoffs, with a core this young and that much money to spend, that could look rather enticing.

The overall point is, we have tons of options moving forward, and with the Warriors and whoever Lebron is on still looking absurdly good for the foreseeable future, having flexible options while simultaneously developing a young core is exactly the place you want to be.

***Now please GarPax don't fuck it up.***","Why the Bulls are actually, and surprisingly, situated quite well moving forward Now, this is gonna be a long one, and cover a lot of points, so I'll try to be as succinct with them as I can.  However, before I begin, I would like to preface this by saying that no, **this is not a defense of GarPax**, and no, **I do not trust them to make the most of this situation**.  And finally, **this is not an argument on whether or not we should have continued to build around Butler**:  it is merely a look at our current situation.  That being said, if unintentionally, it would appear that GarPax have been dealt a pair of pocket aces, and I do think it would be hard to screw this up.  We have an astonishing amount of flexibility heading forward, and here's why:

First, let us look at the upcoming season.

I don't think anyone would argue with the assertion that we will be bad, and there is certainly no chance that we will be contenders.  Given that, it would appear that we have 3 possibilities in terms of where we finish this season.

Option 1:  Top 5 pick.

Now this one is obvious, we are incredibly bad and land a really good pick (ideally top 3).  While this last draft was thought to be incredibly deep, the 2018 draft is projected to be incredibly top-heavy but very shallow.  After the top 5 trio of Bagley-Porter-Donic-Ayton-Bomba (and perhaps Bridges), it would appear, at least early on, that talent drops off precipitously.  But up to that point, the draft looks primed to have several options for a generational talent.

"Irving named 4 teams he’d like to be traded to, but that’s irrelevant.  He doesn’t have a no-trade clause and he has 2 guaranteed years left on his deal, so the Cavs could send him anywhere they get the best deal.  But what deals are even out there for Irving?  Are the Bulls even in play?

A number of stars have already been traded for much less than expected.  And now the Cavs have the added impediment of the draft and 90% of free agency already settled.  So there are far fewer teams able to make deals, because you can’t trade the free agents you just signed until mid-season.

Looking over the league, there are some options for Cleveland.  But the only realistic scenarios aren’t overwhelming.  I’m assuming two things for Cleveland:  they want a big name to remain a contender for one season, but they also want pick/assets/flexibility to start a rebuild next summer if LeBron bolts.  So I’ve excluded trash teams that can only offer young guys and picks.  And I’ve excluded all recently signed free agents because they are not trade-able this summer.

Here’s a look at who might have the assets to enter the conversation:

Boston:  Plenty of assets, but I don’t think the Cavs even consider doing business with them.

Charlotte:  A package involving Kemba Walker.  Possibly interests Cavs, but the pick(s) probably isn’t lottery.  And does Jordan give up a 23-point, 40% 3pt. shooter PLUS other assets for a Dukie?

Memphis:  A package involving Conley.  Cavs get a 20-point, 40% 3pt. shooter, but the pick(s) probably isn’t lottery.

Miami:  A package involving Dragic.  Cavs get a 20-point, 40% 3pt. shooter, but the pick(s) probably isn’t lottery.

Milwaukee:  The package would have to include Giannis, and that’s probably a deal-breaker for Milwaukee.

Minnesota:  Minnesota won’t offer Butler or Towns, and I can’t see the Cavs being interested in much else.  And Teague can’t be traded.

New Orleans:  Cousins would be the only name offered, and the Cavs wouldn’t be interested.  NO can’t even throw in a point guard, because they both just signed.

New York:  Carmelo is not interested in the Cavs and is taking a hard stance for the Rockets.  And the Knicks aren’t offering Porzingis.  No deal.

Philadelphia:  Philly has big names, but they’re all unproven kids.  Criterion #1:  The Cavs want to contend next year.  No deal.

Phoenix:  A package involving Bledsoe or Booker.  Decent chance for a lottery pick.

Portland:  Package would have to include Lillard, and I don’t know how that makes sense for Portland.

San Antonio:  Package would have to include Leonard, and that’s not happening.

Toronto:  Package involving DeRozan, but Toronto already has a franchise PG they just re-signed.

Utah:  Package involving Gobert, but it’s not the position the Cavs ideally want back.

Chicago:  A package involving Wade and a young PG like Dunn.  Pick(s) are almost definitely lottery.

To me, Memphis, Miami and Phoenix offer some firepower at the PG position.  Phoenix has the advantage because of what should be a much better pick.  But I would put Chicago as the dark horse.  LeBron still respects Wade, Wade still puts up points, Dunn has promise at the PG (especially if the Cavs sign Rose to be the starter), and the pick should be in the lottery.

But like I said, the market isn’t overwhelming.  And I wonder whether the Cavs will just hold on to Irving for another year (when the market could even be worse since he'll only have one year remaining).","The Not-So-Great Market for an Irving Trade Irving named 4 teams he’d like to be traded to, but that’s irrelevant.

This would be a team that I would definitely root for. Already getting mind-gasms from thinking about it.

Team composition is pretty solid...just lacking a good passer. Defense seems above average, but three-point shooting could be a problem.

The playstyle for all of these players really represents Chicago streetball. Don't be a wuss and shoot the three, work for your basket. Rough, tough, never giving up mentality seen in a lot of these players...we have some quality defenders(Beverley just won the NBA Hustle Award and y'all should know who the defensive beasts are).

"With Lauri Markkanen and potentially Niko taking up significant minutes at the 4 spot this season, what role do you guys see Bobby having in the side. I know that Lauri and Niko are known as floor-stretching 3pt specialists, but shooting range is also one of Bobby's best traits.

I see him as a player that provides 3 pt shooting, rebounding and put backs, and he'll run in transition, but that's about it at this stage in his career. He can't jump, he can't pass, he sets poor screens, his on ball defense is poor, his team defense is poor, he offers no rim protection. So...

Realistically, what do people think he can provide this year? Do you expect him to start, to come off the bench as a contributer, or to be buried on the bench again? Where do you think he can excel, or show significant growth? And which parts of his game are just lost causes?

"I know the bulls have been a sorry excuse for a franchise for awhile, but they have generated buzz since the hiring of Paxson, and i can think of far worse GM's. 

realistically how many teams have been champions since 2003?

Piston/Spurs/Heat/Celtics/Lakers/Mavericks/Warriors/Cavs

4 teams. literally 4 eastern conference teams. and 4 western conference teams.

thats more than 4 division worth of teams that have failed.

Before this #FireGarpax, I thought the ownership of the bulls were terrible and their draft luck was sickening. I was also irritated they literally traded away a pick for cash straight up which was infuriating, but they haven't been worse than the knicks or a few other teams. 

Maybe i'm missing something though... 

What are the best and worst transactions they've made?


 I know I did feel like Paxson Fleeced the Knicks.

pretty much gave up Eddy Curry, Antonio Davis, 1st round pick(Wilson Chandler), for Jermaine Jackson, Mike Sweetney, Tim Thomas, 1st Round Pick(Lamarcus Aldridge), 1st Round Pick(Joakim Noah), 2nd round pick (Kyrklo Fesenko, and 2nd Round Pick(Jon Brockman)

They gambled Aldridge for Tyrus Thromas which was a gamble but the consensus was Tyrus Thomas > Aldridge on most mock drafts. shit just didn't workout.

Anyways im curious to know what the hate is all about that warranted a billboard

"I know tanking can be controversial, and I've seen plenty of die hard Bulls fans disappointed about letting Jimmy go. However, this is the year to be bad, and fans should be excited about getting a top pick next season. I'm rooting for the Bulls to lose as much as possible this season. 
    
Having the worst record doesn't guarantee the top pick, but it does guarantee a top 4 pick. There are 4-5 potential franchise players at the top of the draft.  
  
Michael Porter Jr. - very skilled combo forward with elite athleticism, a great mid-range game, and the ability to knock down threes.
  
Luka Doncic - Euro point forward extraordinaire with what Stacey King would call ""sneaky hops."" Incredibly smart player. He's a lanky ball handler that could play 1-3 from day one.  
  
DeAndre Ayton - True 7 footer with a ton of potential on both ends of the floor. The way he moves reminds me a lot of Greg Oden, which makes him the scariest option, in my opinion. He's an elite rebounder and a great inside presence.  
  
Mo Bamba - A physical freak with a wingspan that's rumored to be nearly 8 feet. This guy has  multiple DPOY written all over him. He's very skinny, but he has the frame to fill out a bit. Bamba has the potential to become a tremendous defensive talent with upside on the offensive end. I think his floor is Rudy Gobert/DeAndre Jordan.  
  
Marvin Bagley III - This guy is special. Generational talent. In my opinion he's a Kevin Durant clone. He has the potential to be a KD/Giannis type player that handles the ball and scores on one end while protecting the rim on the other end. If he declares in 2018, he'll be the first pick.

"Lakers fan here guys, I come in peace, just wanting to give you a little scouting report on our boy Nwaba, obviously he doesn't give you too much offensively but I'll tell you what he does well and where he hurts you, as well as pointing out the strongest parts of his overall fairly spectacular defence.


Offence: he is a dangerous cutter who will find and exploit seems wherever possible, he is an excellent finisher through contact because of all that bulk, dunks like mini shaq with them knees up.
Not much shooting to speak of, nor much ball handling skill or passing ability however he is capable in both areas, he's not gonna throw the ball out of bounds or lose his dribble too often and he seems to be improving day by day on everything but shooting.

Defence: Nwaba is a ball of energy, one of my favourite players for the potion of last season we had him because our D was so bad and watching Nwaba go all out and legitimately lock down just about anybody he was put in front was hella impressive, from the day he walked in he was our premier perimeter defender and I watched him do an excellent job on guys like Wall and Jimmy B, I would constantly find myself screaming ""you can't take Nwaba one on one"" seriously, that boy is about as lockdown as it gets. 

He is great on ball but don't expect too much help D or playing passing lanes, still an excellent defensive player overall, surprisingly good rebounder for his height on both glasses 

Intangibles: Nwaba seems like a great team guy, always looking to make the right play for him or a team mate, and as stated before, takes the best player on D.


I loved Nwaba's game so much and had hoped to see him back, look after him please! 

We call him the black nwamba, but that might not work for you guys. ","David Nwaba Lakers fan here guys, I come in peace, just wanting to give you a little scouting report on our boy Nwaba, obviously he doesn't give you too much offensively but I'll tell you what he does well and where he hurts you, as well as pointing out the strongest parts of his overall fairly spectacular defence.


Offence: he is a dangerous cutter who will find and exploit seems wherever possible, he is an excellent finisher through contact because of all that bulk, dunks like mini shaq with them knees up.
Not much shooting to speak of, nor much ball handling skill or passing ability however he is capable in both areas, he's not gonna throw the ball out of bounds or lose his dribble too often and he seems to be improving day by day on everything but shooting.

"No real cap benefits considering our current team's situation, lost a player in McDermott who was better than anyone we gained, lost a pick, lost our longest tenured Bull who could slot perfectly in this lineup and help mask some of Lauri's issues going forward defensively. We gained a PG who we knew had next to no potential beyond being a young asset, a big who we just let walk (the best player of the bunch imo), and gained Morrow who we let walk as well.

I don't want this to be a beating the dead horse fire garpax post, but looking back on the trade after telling myself ""maybe Payne would make this worth it, or we'd use the cap space to bring in at least a couple contributors"" to give it time, I see absolutely zero benefit to anything in that trade. It's unbelievable, really. There is almost always **something** to hang your hat on in a trade. The Butler trade didn't bother me beyond being upset that we lost a great talent, the Rose trade certainly didn't, but this just strikes me as absolutely mind-numbingly stupid both at the time and in hindsight. That is a rarity when it comes to trades in my observation. There is just nothing in the return to gleam any sort of value out of.

"What if Jimmy stayed?

He is 27

He might have fit well with a guy like Marc Gasol or MConley?

ADavis and or Cousins become available?

This is going to be  a long rebuild with these guys.
I love Lavine. Is Lavine going to get $100mil next offseason?? Id rather have Jimmy at $90.

It is in the past, but in the past lies all of the evidence to #FIREGARPAX.

They deserve good credit for drafting Taj,Jimmy,Noah. The also do not get enough credit for making enough money available to retain ROSE NOAH AAAAND ACQUIRE LBJ + WADE n maybe BOSH. Chicago is more expensive n less sexy than Miami. Those guys clearly made a good decision n won titles. 

That being said, GarPax received NO VALUE or near to none on the following players. In my opinion, these players had some value to contenders at the time, before their Free Agency, or to a rebuilding franchise taking a step forward. In some cases those players would have been valuable resignees for better contention at the time or trade value later.

Ben Gordon, Pau Gasol, Luol Deng, Kyle Korver, Joakim Noah, Omer Asik

They traded 5 picks to get McDermott. Two of those picks were Gary Harris and Jusuf Nurkic. Thise two alone would have had the Bulls in a completely different position than they were prior to the Jimmy move. McDermott was not worth 5 picks. After all that they give up on him way too young, only so they can get rid of the heart n soul,  Taj. McDermott struggled n doesnt play defense, but the Bulls cannot shoot n they trade Snell n McDermott last season.

When they swapped the 16 for the 7 in the Jimmy trade, that was the absolute final straw. Then, they sell Jordan Bell for cash. I thought the Bulls were rebuilding with young assets. Nope! cash for the old ass hats. Lol. 

This front office contradicts itself continuously. It must be embarrassing. I mean they have to know how ridiculous they are with their claims of having a vision and a plan. 

Jimmy,Marc Gasol,Wade ? maybe space for the banana boat? Melo atleast?  That doesnt mean the Bulls cannot attain draft picks and young talent while being competitive. They were somewhat smart until Rose got injured. Something changed after that.

The biggest burn to me was Thibbs leaving.  I knew it was the end. They won.  No more hope for Derrick to return to anything. Sad sports story, but the Bulls never responded well to any of it. It is very disappointing as a loyal fan. 

I love the NBA and it's stars. I cannot wait to see how the TimberBul... Timber WOLVES compete.
I love the Warriors players, though seeing Klay in a nee uniform would be very intruiging. I would lovvvve to see him in Red in the Windy. The BIGS in Nawlins will be interesting. I'm sure this is the end of Memphis. Charlotte is a bit better. I hope the Wizards can get better. Celtics are doing everything right.  Will they ever make a big trade? I love young players like Giannis, Devin Booker, Porzingis... The league is looking great. It has a ton of value. The Bulls, my team, ehck. Not so much.

I think the Bulls need to be sold. They need a younger, fun, aggressive owner. They need someone who wants to win. Winning brings more money anyway.

They never get value, so maybe someone can buy the Bulls for cheap. Cash considerations.

"Since we decided to trade butler and go full on-tank, other teams have followed suit and traded away / let go of their star players (namely Hawks, Pacers, and Knicks soon after they trade  Melo). I would lump the Bulls with the following teams that will have high lottery odds:

Nets (bad)
Magic (bad)
Hawks (tanking)
Knicks (tanking)
Pacers (tanking)
Lakers (bad in the suddenly loaded west)
Suns (bad in the suddenly loaded west)
Kings (bad in the suddenly loaded west)

Unfortunately with Wade and Rlo I could easily see the bulls finish with a better record than the above teams and have worse lottery odds when we need a top 3 pick next year to rebuild properly. When the Butler trade first occurred I was quite confident in this but the landscape has definitely gotten murkier since then with more East teams following our tanking lead and the shift of talent to the West making it harder to find wins for the Suns and Lakers.

Although there were some of you that didn't really like the location, there were a couple of reasons why I chose this billboard... Multiple billboard agencies refused to work with me because they didn't want to make an Chicago Bulls anti-FO billboard, which made my options severely limited. Most of the other billboard agencies (that were left) only featured really high end locations, which would've cost $15 grand plus. The price that I received was good enough to allow me to pursue a couple days of digital billboard advertising as well. I also really wanted a location where we can easily get pictures of the billboard so we can post it on social media and spam the Chicago Bulls social media pages. The owner agreed to donate a percentage to the Boys and Girls Club of Chicago or South Side YMCA. Those are mainly the reasons I went with this location.

That's it guys! 

I will be using the extra money that will go towards a digital billboard for the Bulls first home game! I'm working with an ad agency now, and will try to feature the billboard right next to the United Center or 90/94 so we can get some of the traffic from the first home Bulls game.

"I've seen several people questioning why we would let Rondo go only to turn around and sign another veteran point guard, instead of just keeping Rondo.  However, if we could manage to trade Rondo and nab Milos on a reasonable contract, it would actually be a really smart thing to do.  Here's why:

First, and to get it out of the way, Rondo and Hoiberg/GarPax actually seem to be on relatively good terms, and it's been reported they've been talking about his future with the team.  It's entirely possible that Rondo simply isn't keen on going through a full-on rebuild, and the FO respect him enough to facilitate him moving on.  If that's the case, then we'd still want a solid vet PG to help mentor our young guys, especially Dunn.  And given that Dunn is already a really solid defender, being mentored by a guy who's a great shooter and passer, something of which Rondo is only one, could very well be a boon for him.

Secondly, Rondo can be bought out for 3 million, but his deal on the books takes up ~13 million dollars.  That means a team can trade for him and immediately take 10 million of there books, assuming they traded a 13 million equivalent contract.  This makes him incredibly valuable for a team looking to shed assets, and those teams tend to be willing to pay for such a move (i.e. Deng + a 1st, Carroll + Nogueira + 2 2nds, etc.).  This is perfect for a rebuilding team looking to stockpile draft picks and other assets.

And finally, Milos in a year is likely to be in a very similar position to Rondo currently--a vet PG with a very nice skillset who could be moved relatively easily in order to take on more bad contracts + assets.  It might even be possible to do at the deadline of this upcoming season if we really wanted to fall off and give the young guys tons of minutes to end the season.","Why it makes sense to part ways with Rondo *and* sign Milos I've seen several people questioning why we would let Rondo go only to turn around and sign another veteran point guard, instead of just keeping Rondo.

"I was reading [a blog about the Minnesota Timberwolves](http://www.awolfamongwolves.com/2017/06/four-questions-that-follow-the-jimmy-butler-trade/) for reasons, and I ran across a comparison of Butler to Dunn and LaVine that I thought might be of interest to Bulls fans, at least if you don't mind some ugly truths.  The good news?  LaVine is a better and more frequent three point shooter than Butler.  The bad news?  Everything else:

>First, Dunn can largely be dismissed as a non-factor in this equation. While he played good defense, it was mostly with the second unit last year and the number of games where he seemed like a pivotal contributor can be counted on one hand. More relevant than his good defense was his atrocious offense, captured as well as anything by his single-digit PER of 8.1. For a point guard in today’s NBA, that just isn’t good enough. And for Dunn to be an effective off-the-ball offensive player he needs to dramatically improve his shooting. Dunn has no clear place in an NBA offense, at this point. Add in his advanced rookie age (turned 23 in March) and the likelihood that he ever becomes more than a disruptive bench defender and significant offensive liability seems remote. Sending Dunn away in a trade of this magnitude amounts to a “throw in.” I don’t mean to trash Dunn here — he seems like a good guy, hard worker, and his approach to defense is borderline inspiring. But compared to LaVine and especially Butler, his game is not in the same conversation.

>Dismissing Dunn effectively leaves us with a LaVine/Butler swap. (Not in terms of the transaction itself, which also flipped the eventual rights to Lauri Markkanen for Justin Patton, but in terms of what happened to the Wolves rotation from last season to next.) This is a major change for a few different reasons.

>First, and worst for the Wolves, losing LaVine and adding Jimmy Butler means a downgrade in three-point shooting ability. While LaVine’s all-around game remained a work-in-progress up through the night he tore his ACL last February, he clearly established himself as an elite perimeter shooter. In high (and increasing) volume for the past two seasons he shot 39 percent from downtown. Many of these shots were semi-contested, far from the “wide open in the corner” variety that boost the percentages of good-team role players around the league. Watching LaVine go through his pregame shootaround became a source of my own entertainment last season. He has a beautiful, effortless stroke with range that extends a few feet behind the three-point line.

>On the other side of this trade, Butler is not as good of a perimeter shooter. He hit 36.7 percent of threes last year, which was above his career average of 33.7, but only tried 3.3 of them per game; exactly one half the number that LaVine shot per game for the Wolves. For a team that made the fewest threes in the entire league last year, swapping its only prolific perimeter shooter for Jimmy Butler will only make them worse in that area.

>There. We got the one and only way that the Butler-LaVine swap hurts the Wolves. In every other way, it’s a massive upgrade.

>First, defense. Butler was on the NBA’s All-Defensive Team in 2014, ’15, and ’16, and could very well be on it again whenever that gets announced for 2017. Simply put, he’s really good at D. Butler is strong, athletic, tough, aggressive, serious, and it seems reasonable to expect some degree of contagiousness to his effort that will infect Wiggins and Towns with more defensive focus. That’s the hope, anyway. If the youngins don’t show up with their priorities more skewed toward getting stops, there will be a loud veteran voice in their ear.

>LaVine, as every Timberwolves viewer knows, is not a good defensive player. While he has supreme athleticism and seems to try hard, his lack of physical strength and poor awareness combine for sub-par D. The Wolves always defend better when he’s off the floor than when he’s on it, and his mistakes can be easily observed by anyone paying attention.

>Second, Butler adds another playmaker to the Wolves starting five. Last year, Rubio was the only Wolf capable of setting up teammates. Thibs experimented with “Point Wiggins” to little success, and never even bothered with LaVine, whose skillset to this point does not include slashing into the lane against a ball defender, a basic prerequisite for effective wing passing. Butler averaged 5.5 assists per game last year and 4.8 the year before that. LaVine averaged 3.0. Butler, more than any recent Timberwolf including Rubio can handle primary playmaking duties against late-game, physical defense. He can get his own shot or create one for an open teammate.

>To help illustrate how Butler attacks the paint, he shot a whopping 8.9 free throws per game last year. LaVine, a high-flyer but featherweight who doesn’t absorb contact well, shot just 3.0. The Wolves overall offensive rating of 108.1 (10th ranked in the NBA) dropped to 106.5 with LaVine on the floor, despite his sharp shooting. Last year’s Bulls were an offensively-challenged sort with their bizarro experiment to surround non-shooters with non-shooters; often times rocking a starting perimeter trio of Butler, Rajon Rondo, and Dwyane Wade. Butler, however, managed to carry them to decent offense, with an O-rating of 106.4. When he sat, the Bulls were a miserable 100.0, a number that would’ve qualified as the worst offense in the NBA.

>It seems inevitable that Butler is going to bump the Timberwolves defense from the bottom tier of the league into at least the middle and possibly higher than that, if Wiggins and Towns take careful notes and follow his lead. But it also seems possible, if not probable, that Butler could improve the Wolves’ OFFENSE as well. He isn’t the shooter LaVine is — not even close — but he’s so much better at driving to the basket, drawing fouls, and creating for teammates, that it might add up to a net-positive on both ends of the floor.

>The Wolves got much, much better, immediately in this trade and that is without taking LaVine’s recovering knee into consideration. Jimmy Butler is one of the best wings in the world and he is now a Timberwolf.

What surprised me the most is that LaVine, even if he completely recovers his athleticism, is not good at driving to the basket.  He lacks physical strength and does not have the handles to dribble through traffic.  When I see him in the dunk competition, I think of him as a slasher, but it turns out he's a three point specialist with poor defense.

I was also reminded of just how poor the Bulls' offense was last year without Butler on the floor, dropping from a rating of 106.4 to ""a miserable 100.0, a number that would’ve qualified as the worst offense in the NBA.""","What Bulls fans can expect from Dunn and LaVine, a Minnesota perspective.

>There. We got the one and only way that the Butler-LaVine swap hurts the Wolves. In every other way, it’s a massive upgrade.

>First, defense. Butler was on the NBA’s All-Defensive Team in 2014, ’15, and ’16, and could very well be on it again whenever that gets announced for 2017. Simply put, he’s really good at D. Butler is strong, athletic, tough, aggressive, serious, and it seems reasonable to expect some degree of contagiousness to his effort that will infect Wiggins and Towns with more defensive focus. That’s the hope, anyway. If the youngins don’t show up with their priorities more skewed toward getting stops, there will be a loud veteran voice in their ear.

>LaVine, as every Timberwolves viewer knows, is not a good defensive player. While he has supreme athleticism and seems to try hard, his lack of physical strength and poor awareness combine for sub-par D. The Wolves always defend better when he’s off the floor than when he’s on it, and his mistakes can be easily observed by anyone paying attention.

>Second, Butler adds another playmaker to the Wolves starting five. Last year, Rubio was the only Wolf capable of setting up teammates. Thibs experimented with “Point Wiggins” to little success, and never even bothered with LaVine, whose skillset to this point does not include slashing into the lane against a ball defender, a basic prerequisite for effective wing passing. Butler averaged 5.5 assists per game last year and 4.8 the year before that. LaVine averaged 3.0. Butler, more than any recent Timberwolf including Rubio can handle primary playmaking duties against late-game, physical defense. He can get his own shot or create one for an open teammate.

>To help illustrate how Butler attacks the paint, he shot a whopping 8.9 free throws per game last year. LaVine, a high-flyer but featherweight who doesn’t absorb contact well, shot just 3.0. The Wolves overall offensive rating of 108.1 (10th ranked in the NBA) dropped to 106.5 with LaVine on the floor, despite his sharp shooting. Last year’s Bulls were an offensively-challenged sort with their bizarro experiment to surround non-shooters with non-shooters; often times rocking a starting perimeter trio of Butler, Rajon Rondo, and Dwyane Wade. Butler, however, managed to carry them to decent offense, with an O-rating of 106.4. When he sat, the Bulls were a miserable 100.0, a number that would’ve qualified as the worst offense in the NBA.

>It seems inevitable that Butler is going to bump the Timberwolves defense from the bottom tier of the league into at least the middle and possibly higher than that, if Wiggins and Towns take careful notes and follow his lead. But it also seems possible, if not probable, that Butler could improve the Wolves’ OFFENSE as well. He isn’t the shooter LaVine is — not even close — but he’s so much better at driving to the basket, drawing fouls, and creating for teammates, that it might add up to a net-positive on both ends of the floor.

>The Wolves got much, much better, immediately in this trade and that is without taking LaVine’s recovering knee into consideration. Jimmy Butler is one of the best wings in the world and he is now a Timberwolf.

What surprised me the most is that LaVine, even if he completely recovers his athleticism, is not good at driving to the basket.  He lacks physical strength and does not have the handles to dribble through traffic.  When I see him in the dunk competition, I think of him as a slasher, but it turns out he's a three point specialist with poor defense.

I was also reminded of just how poor the Bulls' offense was last year without Butler on the floor, dropping from a rating of 106.4 to ""a miserable 100.0, a number that would’ve qualified as the worst offense in the NBA.""",61,9,"What Bulls fans can expect from Dunn and LaVine, a Minnesota perspective.",https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/6k8mar/what_bulls_fans_can_expect_from_dunn_and_lavine_a/
